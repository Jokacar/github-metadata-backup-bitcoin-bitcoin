Also the pcp/netif files were added recently in #30043, while netaddress.h is older so I assume it is more likely netaddress is in the place where people want it to be.\r\n\r\n> The `libraries.md` document is a bit vague on what belongs to `util` vs `common`.

Since util is also used by `libbitcoin_kernel` it could make sense to move things out of it that the kernel doesn't need, but #28690 introduces a whole new `kernel_util` for that purpose.\r\n\r\nBoth are just collections of library functions shared by various executables. I think it util is a good place for things that are general purpose and can be broadly useful, and common is a better place for things that are hacky or more specific to the bitcoin core codebase. Also if something is used by kernel code it _must_ go in util, not common. \r\n\r\nI tend to think the current implementation of #28690 adding a kernel_util library just adds complexity and is not a good idea. I would prefer it if kernel just used the regular util library, and provided a few extra utilities outside developers could use or not use, instead of feeling the need to strip out everything that isn't used internally.",
