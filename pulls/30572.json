      "body": "The search is  being done for every received transaction, even when code unconditionally won't reject it due to the protocol versions.  This could be very simply avoided by moving the \"!pfrom.HasPermission(NetPermissionFlags::Relay) && pfrom.GetCommonVersion() >= REJECT_UNSOLICITED_TX_VERSION\" test up to surround the expected.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the search could also be gated on NET LOGGING enabled (e.g. net logging || (version && no permission)), and then it could log the unexpected TXN even if it will not ignore it (the disposition could be in the log message).   This would make it easier to monitor the behavior (when I used to monitor for this I carried a local patch).\r\n\r\nGiven that the check now only applies to a newer protocol version could it be made to disconnect the peer?  This may cause a more rapid discovery of bugs in users code since being disconnected is much more obvious than having the txn silently dropped.\r\n\r\nI'm somewhat dubious of the value of this behind a version check:  the abusive hosts that intentionally do this will just continue to be an older version and I don't think it's realistic to cut off older versions completely.   But I think this PR is vastly superior to doing nothing, and perhaps once the new behavior is widely deployed the test could be extended to older versions (presumably in ignore rather than disconnect form, if this is changed to disconnect).\r\n",

      "body": "Having gone and looked at the old discussion, I see some skepticism for the value of this and I don't see anyone pointing out the reason I think it's important.\r\n\r\nAt times there have been parties that mass connect to every node on the network and blast them with transactions, presumably in an effort to make sure the transactions get propagated and accepted.  This is abusive particularly because it wastes bandwidth when it gives nodes transactions they already know or have already requested from someone else.  It's also abusive because it wastes connection slots... a mass connector uses thousands of times the slot capacity of an ordinary nodes.   If the conduct doesn't work (or just gets the peer disconnected) then it will be of no value and will likely stop (or not be started again in the future, if it's not happening right now).\r\n\r\nThe same issue also previously existed for full blocks with some misguided miners blindly spamming every node they could connect with a full block every time they solved one, effectively DOSing the whole network (and probably working contrary to their intent).  The best and often only way to correct conduct like this is to just make it not even conjecturally provide a benefit. \r\n\r\nPerhaps one way to hasten the deployment is to enforce this on P2Pv2 connections immediately in addition to or instead of the protocol version check,  custom announcement code isn't likely to use v2 yet.  As far as I know all widely deployed software already does the right thing.  \r\n",
