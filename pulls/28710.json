Migration of legacy wallets uses the independent BDB parser and a minimal `LegacyDataSPKM` that allows the legacy data to be loaded so that the migration can be completed.\r\n\r\nAll tests which tested legacy wallet behavior have been removed. The `--descriptors` and `--legacy-wallet` options are removed from the functional tests.\r\n\r\nBDB has been removed as a dependency and documentation have been updated to reflect that.\r\n\r\nDepends on #26596",

          "body": "Here is a proposed timeline for the move from legacy wallets to descriptor wallets, and at the same time, bdb to sqlite, culminating with the removal of both legacy wallets and bdb. Even though the wallet type and the wallet storage format are orthogonal to each other, as noted in #19077, I would like to tie them together for the sake of simplicity when it comes to how we make new wallets and the migration of one type to another.\r\n\r\nThe 4 combinations of type and format are: legacy-bdb, legacy-sqlite, descriptor-bdb, and descriptor-sqlite. While all 4 types will be supported, we will primarily deal with legacy-bdb and descriptor-sqlite. Setting `descriptors=True` in `createwallet` (or checking the Descriptors option in the GUI) will always make a descriptor-sqlite. Setting that to `False` will always make a legacy-bdb.\r\n\r\n- [x] 0.21 (late 2020)\r\n  - [x] Initial release of descriptor type and sqlite format. (#16528, #19077)\r\n  - [x] Descriptor type is experimental with a warning as such (#16528)\r\n  - [x] Only legacy-bdb and descriptor-sqlite will be created (#19077)\r\n- [x] 22.0 (mid 2021)\r\n  - [x] Implement descriptor exports (#20226)\r\n  - [x] Legacy type remains default (no pr needed)\r\n  - [x] Introduce `dump` and `createfromdump` wallet tool commands with an additional `-format` option to specify the wallet type (#19137)\r\n    * Users may use `dump` and then `createfromdump` in order to make legacy-sqlite from legacy-bdb\r\n    * Users may use `dump` and then `createfromdump` in order to make descriptor-bdb from descriptor-sqlite\r\n  - [x] If a wallet specified in conf or command line doesn't exist, don't make a wallet and instead warn (#15454)\r\n- [x] 23.0 (early 2022)\r\n  - [x] Change descriptor type to non-experimental (#23002)\r\n  - [x] Change `createwallet` `descriptors` default to `True` (#23002)\r\n  - [x] Change wallet tool `create` `-descriptors` default to `True` (#23002)\r\n- [x] 24.0 (late 2022)\r\n  - [x] Introduce `migratewallet` command to migrate a legacy-bdb to descriptor-sqlite (#19602)\r\n  - [x] For newly created legacy-bdb wallets, warn that they are deprecated and will soon be unsupported (#24505)\r\n- [ ] 26.0 (late 2023)\r\n  - [x] When loading legacy-bdb, descriptor-bdb, or legacy-sqlite wallets, warn that the legacy type and bdb format will soon be unsupported, as applicable. (#27869)\r\n  - [x] Deprecate creating new legacy-bdb wallets #28597 \r\n  - [ ] `migratewallet` bug fixes\r\n    - [x] #28609\r\n    - [ ] #28546\r\n- [ ] 27.0 (early 2024)\r\n  - [ ] Remove `migratewallet` experimental warning #28037 \r\n  - [ ] Reimplement legacy-bdb to descriptor-sqlite migration (maybe as a separate command or in the wallet tool) to be independent of `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` and BDB (#26596)\r\n  - [ ] For `dump`, implement an independent BDB file loader (this should probably be shared with the previous) (#26606)\r\n  - [ ] Stop creating new legacy-bdb wallets (not yet started)\r\n  - [ ] Batch DB Writes (@furszy) (#28574)\r\n  - [ ] GUI: Migrate wallets that are not loaded (not yet started)\r\n- [ ] 28.0 (late 2024)\r\n  - [ ] Stop loading legacy-bdb, descriptor-bdb, legacy-sqlite wallet entirely. Inform users how to migrate (not yet started)\r\n  - [ ] Remove `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` except for the independent migration stuff (#28710)\r\n  - [ ] Remove BDB except for independent loading for migration stuff (#28710)\r\n\r\nAdditional improvements that have no target deadline:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Run `--legacy-wallet` and `--descriptors` tests in a single invocation of a functional test case  #20892\r\n- [ ] Caching to improve performance of migrated non-HD descriptor wallets (also perf improvement in general) #26008\r\n- [ ] Backwards compatibility tests fixes for descriptor wallets #28027\r\n\r\nThe migration code will probably be around for a long time/forever.\r\n\r\nNote that we expect users who go through the effort to make a legacy-sqlite or descriptor-bdb wallet to suck it up and deal with the consequences of doing something that isn't really supported. Such users should be able to figure out for themselves how to migrate their wallets. (Maybe `migratewallet` can migrate legacy-sqlite to descriptor-sqlite. bdb to sqlite is way easier than legacy to descriptor).",

          "title": "Deniability - a tool to automatically improve coin ownership privacy",
          "body": "This new feature is an implementation of the ideas in Paul Sztorc's blog post \"Deniability - Unilateral Transaction Meta-Privacy\"(https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/deniability/).\r\n\r\nIn short, the idea is to periodically split coins and send them to yourself, making it look like common \"spend\" transactions, such that blockchain ownership analysis becomes more difficult, and thus improving the user's privacy.\r\n\r\nThis is the GUI portion of the PR (bitcoin-core/gui). The core functionality PR ( https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27792 ) is in the main repo (bitcoin/bitcoin).\r\n\r\nThis PR implements an additional \"Deniability\" wallet view. The majority of the GUI code is in a new deniabilitydialog.cpp/h source files containing a new DeniabilityDialog class, hooked up via the WalletView class. \r\n\r\nOn startup and on notable events (new blocks, new transactions, etc), we evaluate the privacy of all coins in the wallet, and we build a \"deniabilization\" candidate list. UTXOs that share the same destination address are grouped together into a single candidate (see DeniabilityDialog::updateCoins and DeniabilityDialog::updateCoinTable).\r\n\r\nWe inspect the blockchain data to find out if we have performed \"deniabilization\" transactions already, and we count how many \"cycles\" (self-sends) have been performed for each coin (see DeniabilityDialog::calculateDeniabilizationStats). Since we infer the state entirely from the blockchain data, even if the wallet is restored from a backup, the state would not be lost. This also means that if the user has performed manual self-sends that have improved the ownership privacy, they will be counted too.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_initial\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/6626cca3-1b96-4ccd-9463-2a91a9993faa\">\r\n\r\nThe user has a couple of controls for the \"deniabillization\" process - a Frequency selector and a Budget spinner, which respectively determine how often to perform a cycle (see below) and how much total BTC to spend on transaction fees.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_pick_budget_frequency\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/7508c23f-2ebb-4345-a440-49b9f60b8412\">\r\n\r\nThe user can initiate the \"deniabillization\" process by pressing the Start button (DeniabilityDialog::startDeniabilization). \r\nThe first time the button is pressed, we offer an information / confirmation box to explain to the user how Deniability works.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"532\" alt=\"deniability_view_start_confirmation\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/c08ee856-8736-4e4e-be71-28219735f764\">\r\n\r\nThe process periodically perform a \"deniabilization\" cycle (DeniabilityDialog::deniabilizeProc). In each such cycle we do the following: \r\nA coin is selected form the candidate list. The more a coin is \"deniabilized\", the less likely it is to be selected. Smaller coins are also less likely to be selected. If a coin is selected, we prepare and broadcast a transaction, which splits the coin into a pair of new wallet addresses (DeniabilityDialog::deniabilizeCoin). \r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_tx_awaiting_confirmation\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/df0354dc-f60f-45db-b692-db5c6ca36253\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"transaction_view_after_deniabilization\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/709084d3-227d-4c0d-ac47-cd83433b992a\">\r\n\r\nIf Bitcoin Core is left running continuously, the cycles would be performed at the selected frequency (with some randomization). If Bitcoin Core is shutdown, the \"deniabilization\" process will resume at the next restart, and if more time has elapsed than the selected frequency, it will perform a single cycle. We deliberately don't \"catch up\" all missed cycles, since that would expose the process to blockchain analysis. The state is saved and restored via QSettings (DeniabilityDialog::loadSettings and DeniabilityDialog::saveSettings).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_next_cycle_countdown\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/da5a71e1-0174-4f2a-a9b3-b8a635abe769\">\r\n\r\nWe monitor each broadcasted transaction and we automatically attempt a fee bump if the transaction is still in the memory pool since the previous cycle (DeniabilityDialog::bumpDeniabilizationTx). We don't issue any other deniabilization transactions until the previous transaction is confirmed (or abandoned/dropped).\r\n\r\nThe process ends when the budget is exhausted or if there's no candidates left. The user can also stop the process manually by pressing a Stop button (DeniabilityDialog::stopDeniabilization).\r\n\r\nExternal signers are supported in a \"best effort\" way - since the user needs to manually sign, we postpone the deniabilization processing till the external signer is connected and use some additional UI to get the user's attention to sign (see the codepath predicated on hasExternalSigner). This is not ideal, so I'm looking for ideas if we can improve this in some way.\r\n\r\nWatch-only wallets are partially supported, where we display the candidate list, but we don't allow any processing (since we don't have the private keys to issue transactions).\r\n\r\nI've tested all this functionality on regtest, testnet, signet and mainnet. I've also added some unit tests (under WalletTests) to exercise the main functions.\r\n\r\nThis is my first change and PR for Bitcoin Core, and I did my best to validate everything against the guidelines and documentation and to follow the patterns in the existing code, but I'm sure there may be things I've missed, so I'm looking forward to your feedback. \r\nIn particular one thing I'm not particularly happy with - the save/restore of state via QSettings makes me a bit nervous as we store wallet specific data keyed on wallet name, however wallets can be erased and new ones created with the same name, so this is not ideal. I made an effort to validate all data on load, but it would be great if we could improve this somehow - either by storing the settings based on some wallet identity signature, or by storing the state in the wallet database (however that doesn't seem accessible via the interfaces::Wallet API). Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

          "body": "The benchmark conducted locally showed a ~65% processing time reduction, on a SSD.\r\nResults can be found at the end of the description.\r\n\r\n#### Detailed Description:\r\nThe current wallet migration process performs only individual db writes. Accessing disk to\r\ndelete all legacy records, clone and clean each address book entry for every created wallet,\r\ncreate each new descriptor (with their corresponding master key, caches and key pool), and\r\nalso clone and delete each transaction that requires to be transferred to a different wallet.\r\n\r\nThis work consolidates all individual disk writes into two batch operations. One for the descriptors\r\ncreation from the legacy data and a second one for the execution of the migration process itself.\r\nEfficiently dumping all the information to disk at once atomically at the end of each process.\r\n\r\nThis represent a significant speed up and also a consistency improvement. During migration, we\r\neither want to succeed or fail. No other outcomes should be accepted. We should never leave a\r\npartially migrated wallet on disk and request the user to manually restore the previous wallet from\r\na backup (at least not if we can avoid it).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since db transactions relevant to the key pool generation were also batched, this work\r\nalso speeds up the regular wallet creation process.\r\n\r\n#### Note for Testers:\r\nThe first commit introduces a benchmark for the migration process. This one can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master to compare results pre and post changes.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the benchmark setup may take some time (~70 seconds here) due to the absence\r\nof a batching mechanism for the address generation process (`GetNewDestination()` calls). Which,\r\nI plan to address in a separate PR, just to not continue expanding this PR.\r\n\r\n#### Final Notes:\r\nThis PR is intended to be an \"all-in-one\" solution that's ready for use and testing. In the coming days, \r\nwill start breaking it down into smaller, focused PRs for better manageability and review.\r\n\r\n————————————————————————\r\n\r\nBenchmark on master (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:-----------\r\n|   65,093,884,958.00 |                0.02 |    0.0% |     65.09 | `WalletMigration`\r\n\r\nBenchmark on this branch (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|   22,926,814,750.00 |                0.04 |    0.0% |     22.93 | `WalletMigration`",

At this point in time, code nits probably aren't going to be useful either.\r\n\r\nThis draft has been posted to provide a tangible example of a softfork we might pursue, and a representation of the necessary code changes.\r\n\r\n### Activation method and parameters\r\n\r\nSpecific activation parameters have not been specified here (or are marked FIXME) to avoid putting the consensus cart before the horse. The activation method here has defaulted to the one used for BIP-0341 and might change pending discussion.",

          "body": "Parsing legacy public keys can fail for three reasons (in this order):\r\n- pubkey is not in hex\r\n- pubkey has an invalid length (not 33 or 65 bytes for compressed/uncompressed, respectively)\r\n- pubkey is crytographically invalid, i.e. is not on curve (`CPubKey.IsFullyValid()` check)\r\n\r\nMany RPCs currently perform these checks manually with different error messages, even though we already have a `HexToPubKey` helper. This PR puts all three checks in this helper (the length check was done on the call-sites before), adds specific error messages for each case, and consequently uses it for all RPCs that parse legacy pubkeys. This leads to deduplicated code and also to more consistent and detailed error messages for the user.\r\n\r\nAffected RPC calls are `createmultisig`, `addmultisigaddress`, `importpubkey`, `importmulti`, `fundrawtransaction`, `walletcreatefundedpsbt`, `send` and `sendall`.\r\n\r\nNote that the error code (-5 a.k.a. `RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY`) doesn't change in any of the causes, so the changes are not breaking RPC API compatibility. Only the messages are more specific.\r\n\r\nThe last commits adds test coverage for the cryptographically invalid (not-on-curve) pubkey case which wasn't exercised before.",

This is due to the implementation currently enforcing a direct single-byte data push (using `CScriptOp.encode_op_n`), which obviously fails for values 17+. Fix that by passing the numbers directly to the CScript list, where it's automatically converted to minimally-encoded pushes (see class method `CScript.__coerce_instance`, branch `isinstance(other, int)`). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second commit adds a unit test to ensure that the encoding  is correct.",

          "body": "Fixing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28250#issuecomment-1674830104 and more.\r\n\r\nCurrently, redeem scripts longer than 520 bytes, which are technically valid under segwit rules, have flaws in the following processes:\r\n1) The multisig creation process fails to deduce the output descriptor, resulting in the generation of an incorrect descriptor. Additionally, the accompanying user warning is also inaccurate.\r\n2) The `signrawtransactionwithkey` RPC command fail to sign them.\r\n3) The legacy wallet `addmultisigaddress` wrongly discards them.\r\n\r\nThe issue arises because most of these flows are utilizing the legacy spkm keystore, which imposes\r\nthe [p2sh max redeem script size rule](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ded687334031f4790ef6a36b999fb30a79dcf7b3/src/script/signingprovider.cpp#L160) on all scripts. Which blocks segwit redeem scripts longer than\r\nthe max element size in all the previously mentioned processes (`createmultisig`, `addmultisigaddress`, and\r\n`signrawtransactionwithkey`).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem, enabling the creation of multisig output descriptors involving more than 15 keys and\r\nallowing the signing of these scripts, along with other post-segwit redeem scripts that surpass the 520-byte\r\np2sh limit.\r\n\r\nImportant note:\r\nInstead of adding support for these longer redeem scripts in the legacy wallet, an \"unsupported operation\"\r\nerror has been added. The reasons behind this decision are:\r\n\r\n1) The introduction of this feature brings about a compatibility-breaking change that requires downgrade\r\n    protection; older wallets would be unable to interact with these \"new\" legacy wallets.\r\n\r\n2) Considering the ongoing deprecation of the legacy spkm, this issue provides another compelling\r\n    reason to transition towards descriptors.\r\n\r\nTesting notes:\r\nTo easily verify each of the fixes, I decoupled the tests into standalone commits. So they can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master. Where `rpc_createmultisig.py` (with and without the `--legacy-wallet`\r\narg) will fail without the bugs fixes commits.\r\n\r\nExtra note:\r\nThe initial commits improves the `rpc_createmultisig.py` test in many ways. I found this test very\r\nantiquated, screaming for an update and cleanup.",

          "body": "A couple of users have requested that we support wallets that encrypt everything, even if the wallet is watch-only, in order to have better privacy if the wallet is stolen. This PR introduces an `EncryptedDatabase` backend for the wallet which encrypts/decrypts each key-value record individually before reading from or writing to the database.\r\n\r\n`EncryptedDatabase` is only supported for SQLite databases and descriptor wallets. This was done in order to have an easier way to get downgrade protection that also does not involve writing an existing record in plaintext (e.g. `minversion` or `flags`). SQLite has a fixed field \"application id\" that we already use for cross-network protection. This is reused to detect if a sqlite database is an encrypted wallet, and thus it prevents older software from attempting to open such wallets.\r\n\r\nIn order to read records from the database, `EncryptedDatabase` will cache the decrypted key in memory so that it can lookup the encrypted key in the database. Values will always be decrypted when read.\r\n\r\nThe encryption scheme is the same one that we use for encrypting private keys. It's not that great, but I didn't feel like re-implementing it, and it seems good enough. The encryption key itself is encrypted with the passphrase and stored in a new record.\r\n\r\nWallets with encrypted databases cannot be loaded on start. They can only be loaded by explicit user action through `loadwallet` which now has a `db_passphrase` parameter to allow the decryption of these wallets. `createwallet` also has a `db_passphrase` to create these wallets. For now, there is no way to encrypt the database after it has been created, nor is there a way to change the passphrase.",

          "body": "In #27286, the wallet keeps track of all of its transaction outputs, even if they are already spent or are otherwise unspendable. This TXO set is iterated for balance checking and coin selection preparation, which can still be slow for wallets that have had a lot of activity. This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

This PR makes it possible to access these parameters directly by name. This is achieved by holding the parameters in a separate `JSONRPCParameters` class which contains mappings from both name to value, and position to value. Two `operator[]` methods are implemented which can accept both strings and ints. This allows for backwards compatibility, while also allowing for future implementation to access the parameters by name.\r\n\r\nThe processing of named arguments ends up being entirely overhauled in order to be able to store the mappings to the parameters.\r\n\r\nBased on #26485 to avoid conflicting with it.",

          "title": "wallet: add `seeds` argument to `importdescriptors`",
          "body": "This PR introduces the ability to import BIP32 master seeds alongside xpubs. It currently expects seeds to be provided in [BIP 93/codex32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0093.mediawiki) either as a single seed or as a list of shares which can be assembled via Shamir Secret Sharing.\r\n\r\nIt could be generalized to other seed formats, e.g. a hex-encoding or the old `sethdseeds` WIF format, easily enough by just attempting to parse the input in those formats and retrying until we find one that works. (Though we must be extremely careful that these formats are unambiguous! If the user imports a seed they don't expect, which fails to match the one they've backed up, the result could be coin loss. For formats with no prefix or checksum, e.g. hex-encoded bytes, we may need to require the user provide a prefix or a separate flag.)\r\n\r\nThe motivation here is that users who are importing their coins from another wallet likely have them in the form of a public descriptor (probably one of the standard `pkh(BIP44/48/84/whatever)` ones) along with a master seed (probably in some seed word format, but this is easy enough to convert to a straight BIP32 seed with an external tool). The seed, presumably, they want to minimize handling of, while the descriptor they are likely to be copy/pasting from somewhere and generally being less careful with.\r\n\r\nTo import this into Core, they currently need to construct a version of their descriptor in which xpubs are replaced by xprivs, and import that. This is cumbersome and potentially dangerous. With this extra RPC flag they are able to separately tweak their descriptor however they need, and then adding their seed data, unmodified, at the last minute in one place.\r\n\r\nMy specific use case is: I have an estate planning document which contains careful instructions for reconstructing seed data from shares which are stored separately and externally to the planning document. Meanwhile, the document itself contains a public descriptor, with checksum already computed, which is stored in several locations accessible by an open-ended set of people. If I were forced to mix the secret data with the public data, it would increase the risk of leaking the secrets as well as the risk of losing the public part.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Other approaches, that I considered but chose not to take:\r\n\r\n* Extend the existing `sethdseed` RPC. This RPC is legacy-only and not supported by descriptor wallets, because it depends on the legacy \"bag of keys\" model where you could stick keys into the wallet and it'd \"just work\", often in surprising ways.\r\n* Add a new descriptor-wallet-based `importseed` RPC or something. This doesn't work for more-or-less the same reason; the descriptor wallet associates all its keys with `ScriptPubKeyManager`s, so we would need to add support for \"global keys\" somehow. This is a lot of work, lots of room for bikeshedding, and I worry that @achow101 will NACK anything that looks too much like a \"bag of keys\" model. (The situation would be much less bad than the legacy one, where 3rd parties could do stuff like mapping p2wpkh addresses to p2pkh ones and the wallet would just accept it ... but it would still potentially lead to user confusion about what exact conditions the wallet could sign for what descriptors, and it may constrain future wallet changes.)\r\n* Adding a `codex32(...)/1/2/3` xpriv format to the descriptor import format. This was suggested to me by @sipa and has the benefit that very closely matches the existing import model.\r\n\r\nPersonally I don't like the latter\r\n* for the reasons stated in the PR description -- I like my descriptors to be public, and my secret data to be limited to 16 bytes, and I think this is a common mode of operation for people coming from other wallets\r\n* ...and maybe worse, a common model for other wallet authors, who would refuse to nicely interoperate with this);\r\n* because it felt like enough of a change to deserve a change to one of the descriptor BIPs, but those are big enough already and it's hard to get tiny changes to propagate to all implementors of standards. Plus it felt wrong to couple codex32 with descriptors like this.i\r\n* because if you have multiple descirptors that use the same seed, it would force you to copy the seed multiple times, which is dangerous. (In some cases [BIP 389](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1354) will make this better, but it doesn't cover everything and anyway is not accepted or implemented yet. One thing at a time :))\r\n\r\nBut what cinched it, and made me switch to the approach in the PR, was that @roconnor-blockstream pointed out to me that the codex32 model means that you can't predict, at writing-down-the-descriptor time, exactly what shares you'll be inputting. And because descriptors have a checksum which covers their entire string encoding, this means that you can't predict ahead-of-timei what will go into the `codex32(...)` slot and therefore what the total checksum ought to be. And this means that either (a) you lose the descriptor checksum, which is a Bad Idea and also inconvenient for importers who' will have to construct a checksum with `getdescriptorinfo` to get `importdescriptors` to accept it, even though said checksum had never been used to protect data in storage; or (b) you modify the descriptor checksum algorithm to be aware of `codex(...)` and to skip checksumming the data inside of that. This means even more implementation complexity that other wallets are unlikely to bring in, plus the result generalizes less easily to other seed formats (e.g. hex) which don't have checksums of their own.\r\n\r\n",

          "title": "wallet: Keep track of the wallet's own transaction outputs in memory",
          "body": "Currently, the wallet is not actually aware about its own transaction outputs. Instead, it will iterate all of the transactions stored in `mapWallet`, and then all of the outputs of those transactions, in order to figure out what belongs to it for the purposes of coin selection and balance calculation. For balance calculation, there is caching that results in it only iterating all of the transactions, but not all of the outputs. However when the cache is dirty, everything is iterated. This is especially problematic for wallets that have a lot of transactions, or transactions that have a lot of unrelated outputs (as may occur with coinjoins or batched payments).\r\n\r\nThis PR helps to resolve this issue by making the wallet track all of the outputs that belong to it in a new member `m_txos`. Note that this includes outputs that may have already been spent. Both balance calculation (`GetBalance`) and coin selection (`AvailableCoins`) are updated to iterate `m_txos`. This is generally faster since it ignores all of the unrelated outputs, and it is not slower as in the worst case of wallets containing only single output transactions, it's exactly the same number of outputs iterated.\r\n\r\n`m_txos` is memory only, and it is populated during wallet loading. When each transaction is loaded, all of its outputs are checked to see if it is `IsMine`, and if so, an entry added to `m_txos`. When new transactions are received, the same procedure is done.\r\n\r\nSince imports can change the `IsMine` status of a transaction (although they can only be \"promoted\" from watchonly to spendable), all of the import RPCs will be a bit slower as they re-iterate all transactions and all outputs to update `m_txos`.\r\n\r\nEach output in `m_txos` is stored in a new `WalletTXO` class. This class contains references to the parent `CWalletTx` and the `CTxOut` itself. It also caches the `IsMine` value of the txout. This should be safe as `IsMine` should not change unless there are imports. This allows us to have additional performance improvements in places that use these `WalletTXO`s as they can use the cached `IsMine` rather than repeatedly calling `IsMine` which can be expensive.\r\n\r\nThe existing `WalletBalance` benchmark demonstrates the performance improvement that this PR makes. The existing `WalletAvailableCoins` benchmark doesn't as all of the outputs used in that benchmark belong to the test wallet. I've updated that benchmark to have a bunch of unrelated outputs in each transaction so that the difference is demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a larger project to have the wallet actually track and store a set of its UTXOs.\r\n\r\nBuilt on #24914 as it requires loading the txs last in order for `m_txos` to be built correctly.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks:\r\n\r\nMaster:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       92,245,141.50 |               10.84 |    0.1% |  988,823,975.00 |  66,803,340.50 |    0.0% |      2.04 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            5,709.90 |          175,134.50 |    0.5% |       80,968.24 |      25,539.15 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|          139,396.17 |            7,173.80 |    0.6% |    1,383,390.50 |     430,276.86 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            5,055.80 |          197,792.47 |    0.3% |       80,968.10 |      25,539.02 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|                9.79 |      102,152,396.19 |    0.1% |          161.00 |          37.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,552,736.00 |              644.02 |    1.5% |   20,316,315.80 |     618,545.80 |    0.6% |      0.08 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|      114,114,732.00 |                8.76 |    0.5% |1,291,047,717.60 | 320,244,602.00 |    0.0% |      6.30 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      359,315,754.00 |                2.78 |    0.1% |4,339,447,818.00 | 136,619,757.00 |    0.7% |      1.80 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|       98,230,601.00 |               10.18 |    0.1% |  537,688,964.00 |  97,332,266.00 |    0.3% |      0.49 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n\r\nPR:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       75,319,868.50 |               13.28 |    0.2% |  863,758,229.00 |  30,892,593.00 |    0.2% |      1.66 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            2,367.62 |          422,364.95 |    1.0% |       35,785.05 |       9,893.01 |    0.2% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|            2,685.58 |          372,359.55 |    0.2% |       36,501.05 |      10,027.01 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            3,462.24 |          288,830.68 |    2.7% |       35,785.06 |       9,893.01 |    0.3% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|               11.65 |       85,838,176.97 |    0.1% |          180.00 |          42.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,563,092.60 |              639.76 |    1.5% |   20,426,154.40 |     649,953.80 |    0.6% |      0.09 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|       58,367,804.40 |               17.13 |    0.9% |  587,164,005.00 | 107,905,843.80 |    0.1% |      3.21 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      365,302,636.00 |                2.74 |    0.2% |4,349,345,147.00 | 138,730,668.00 |    0.8% |      1.83 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|      124,995,585.00 |                8.00 |    1.2% |  801,998,316.00 | 103,210,721.00 |    0.3% |      0.63 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n",

          "body": "This PR adds `last_block_announcement` to the per-peer `getpeerinfo` RPC result. This is the most recent time that this peer was the first to notify our node of a new block (one that we didn't already know about), or zero if this peer has never been the first to notify us of a new block. This timestamp already exists internally and is used for stale-tip eviction logic; this PR exposes it at the RPC layer.\r\n\r\nThis PR started out as a suggestion for additional test coverage, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26172#issuecomment-1259678260. It turned out that the easiest way to test (already-merged) #26172 is to add this field to `getpeerinfo` and have a functional test verify its value. But it may also be useful to have this result in its own right, similar to that RPC's existing `last_block` field -- it indicates something about the quality of our peers. It allows one to predict which peer will be evicted when the stale tip logic activates. (I'm not sure if that would be useful, but it may be.)\r\n\r\nThe functional test added here fails without #26172, which is the main goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not test the actual stale-tip eviction logic; that's difficult to do with a functional test. But it does test the correctness of the timestamp that the eviction logic depends on. #23352 is an attempt to test the eviction logic using a unit test, it's not ready to be merged yet. I think having both kinds of tests would be beneficial.",

This will be used for dumping legacy wallet records and migrating legacy wallets without the need for BDB itself.\r\n\r\nWallettool's `dump` command is changed to use `BerkeleyRODatabase` instead of `BerkeleyDatabase` (and `CWallet` itself) to demonstrate that this parser works and to test it against the existing wallettool functional tests.",

This is done in various places, such as `IsMine`, and helper functions for fetching a `ScriptPubKeyMan` and a `SolvingProvider`. This also has a bit of a performance impact on standard descriptor wallets, although less noticeable due to the small number of SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAs these functions are based on doing `IsMine` for each `ScriptPubKeyMan`, we can improve this performance by caching `IsMine` scriptPubKeys for all descriptors and use that to determine which `ScriptPubKeyMan` to actually use for those things. This cache is used exclusively and we no longer iterate the SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAlso added a benchmark for `IsMine`.",

          "body": "It is useful to have a RPC that can create and add the automatically generated descriptors (that are normally made during creation) to a wallet. This is especially useful when a new default descriptor has been implemented as it allows wallets created before that time to quickly and easily add that type of descriptor.\r\n\r\nIn particular, descriptor wallets created before Taproot was implemented can use the new `createwalletdescriptor` RPC in order to get a Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to keep the newly generated descriptor in line with the existing descriptors, this PR uses #26728 as it exposes a \"wallet extended key\" for us (in addition to upgrading wallets implemented prior to have a wallet xpub). The newly generated descriptors will use the \"wallet extended key\" stored in `CWallet` that PR adds.\r\n\r\n`createwalletdescriptor` is generic and so it can also be used with the other address types. Of course, it given the same wallet extended key, address type, and internal-ness, it will create the same descriptor. So some refactoring has been done in order to detect that the same descriptor is about to be created, and to avoid overwriting any existing descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo be able to use `createwalletdescriptor` with the other address types, we need a way to change the wallet extended key, and so `sethdseed` has been updated and enabled for descriptor wallets. As with legacy wallets, when called without parameters, it will generate a new random master key for the wallet. It can also take a xprv and set that as the master key. It still takes a BIP 32 seed as WIF or as hex as we do for legacy wallets. The seed will be transformed into and stored as a BIP 32 extended key. The latter is to give us greater compatibility with other wallets which often produce non-WIF HD seeds.",

          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",

It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",

          "body": "Erlay Project Tracking: #28646\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation of  [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518) , using primitives in the BIP-330 (see the updated spec  [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki) ). Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670).\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I’ll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n* save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n* increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n* improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\n### How to review\r\n\r\nI suggest doing `make clean && autogen.sh && configure` before you try building it locally.",

          "title": "Multiprocess bitcoin",
          "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an `--enable-multiprocess` configure option which builds new `bitcoin-node`, `bitcoin-wallet`, and `bitcoin-gui` executables with relevant functionality isolated into different processes. See [doc/design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/design/multiprocess.md) for usage details and future plans.\r\n\r\nThe change is implemented by adding a new [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that spawns new wallet and node subprocesses that can be controlled over a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) by calling [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/node.h), [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/wallet.h), and [`ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/chain.h) methods. When running with split processes, you can see the IPC messages going back and forth in `-debug=1` output. Followup PR's #19460 and #19461 add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\r\n\r\nThe IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/ipc/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSlides from a presentation describing this change are available on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).\r\n",
