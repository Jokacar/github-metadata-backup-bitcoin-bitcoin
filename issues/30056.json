    "body": "(EDITED)\r\n\r\nList of implementation changes:\r\n- new database layout: \r\n  - 2 leveldb's (coins/ and blktree/ subdirs), replacing blkindex.dat\r\n  - separate directory (blocks/) with block data (in the usual format, but smaller files) and undo data\r\n- database keys are of the form (char,key) instead of (string,key) for reasons of compactness\r\n- there is no txid-to-diskpos index anymore, only blkid-to-diskpos and txid-to-unspent-outputs\r\n  - this makes getrawtransaction only work on unspent outputs (and slower)\r\n    - an optional txid-to-diskpos index is planned\r\n- some new very specialized serializers are added (compact variable-length integer, compact amount, compact txout)\r\n- block index does not store hashBlockNext anymore - this is reconstructed from hashBestBlock at startup\r\n- at startup, automatically reorg to the best block in blktree/blocks\r\n- new RPCs: gettxoutsetinfo and gettxout operate on the coins database\r\n- no more CTxIndex in-scope: instead, a global pcoinsTip (representing the coin db) and pblocktree (representing the blktree db)\r\n  - intended to be moved to separate modules/classes, properly encapsulated\r\n- blktree database contains statistics about the block file (size, which blocks in it, times, heights, undo stats, ...)\r\n- blktree database contains flag per block that determines the degree of validation it had, to allow future headers-first mode\r\n- block files are pre-allocated (in batches of 16 MiB, the files grow to max 128 MIB), to reduce fragmentation\r\n- transaction hashes are cached, and typically never calculated more than once\r\n\r\nIncluded in the pullreq, but technically separate:\r\n- do -loadblock= and bootstrap.dat import in a separate thread\r\n- add check for strict DER encoding for signatures, and standard public keys\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @sipa in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1677#issuecomment-7794418_\r\n\r\nHello, is there any formula or performance tests to choose the size of 128 MB as chunksize in blk*.data files?\r\n            ",
