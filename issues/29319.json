    "title": "Cluster mempool, CPFP carveout, and V3 transaction policy",
    "body": "Opening an issue for high-level discussion, as the PR that implements this has gotten difficult to follow.\r\n\r\n### Cluster mempool\r\n\r\nWork is underway to [redesign the mempool](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393/1) with different topology constraints on the transaction graph than exist today.  I originally described this proposal in a github issue (#27677), and have shared a draft implementation (#28676).  In brief, with a new mempool design we could simultaneously: fix bugs with mempool eviction and the incentive compatibility of RBF replacements; achieve improved performance; eliminate the ancestor/descendant limits (with the introduction of a likely more relaxed \"cluster\" limit); and likely be in a position to better implement complex behaviors like package validation and package rbf.\r\n\r\n### CPFP carveout is not compatible with cluster mempool\r\n\r\nAs I explain [here](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393#the-cpfp-carveout-rule-can-no-longer-be-supported-12), I believe the CPFP carveout rule (introduced in #15681) is not compatible with the new design. Since some users may be relying on this behavior, we should come up with a workaround to avoid breaking existing applications.\r\n\r\n### V3 transaction policy\r\n\r\nDescribed in #28948, the v3 transaction policy is a proposal to introduce topology restrictions on unconfirmed transactions with `nVersion=3` (which are currently non-standard for relay, and would be made standard under the proposal).  Specifically, v3 transactions would be:\r\n- opted-in to RBF replacement policies (whatever those may be, as they evolve in our project)\r\n- permitted to only be part of mempool clusters that are at most of size 2 (meaning 1 parent/1 child)\r\n- required to have any unconfirmed parents or children also be marked v3 (and therefore subject to these rules)\r\n- bounded in size to at most 1000 vbytes, if the child of an unconfirmed (and therefore v3) parent\r\n\r\nBy offering a policy rule that can enforce a much tighter topology restriction that the current ancestor/descendant limits, we hope to achieve a few things:\r\n\r\n#### Replacing CPFP carveout (with a new sibling-replacement policy)\r\n\r\nWe can provide a way to achieve the goals of the CPFP carveout rule even if the existing carevout rule were to be dropped. As explained in [this post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-November/016518.html), the use-case contemplated by the CPFP carveout rule was one where a single transaction might have two spendable outputs, each spendable by a different party, and that either party should be able to spend their output without hitting global topology limits, provided that their spending transaction was bounded in size and had no other unconfirmed parents. If the v3 policy rule were to be applied to the LN commitment transactions described in that post, then neither of the two outputs that are spendable could be used to hit the limits that carveout is designed to bypass. \r\n\r\nSo if we couple the v3 policy with an RBF rule that would allow one spend of a v3 transaction to replace an existing lower-feerate spend of that same parent -- something we call *sibling eviction* and has a draft implementation in #29306 -- then I believe we will have enacted a set of policies that replicate the CPFP carveout use case. \r\n\r\n#### Provide a general way for fee bumping to work better\r\n\r\nEven apart from the needs of layer 2 protocols, the new v3 policy serves as a general way to bypass the issue of RBF being expensive when a child transaction is created that has a large fee (and is typically large in size, allowing for it to be low feerate).  This has been the source of user complaints since our RBF policies were first deployed, and by bounding the size of child transactions we effectively can limit the amount of additional fee a user would need to pay due to the presence of such children.  \r\n\r\nNote, of course, that this property is also what makes the sibling-eviction-policy described above workable.\r\n\r\n### Proposed roadmap\r\n\r\nTo unblock the cluster mempool project, I think we need the following:\r\n1. Deployment of the V3 policy rules (current proposal is #28948)\r\n2. Deployment of V3 sibling eviction rbf rules (current proposal is #29306)\r\n\r\nThen, projects that use CPFP carveout would need to be able to adopt the new policy rules.  After the last LN spec discussion, I understand that migrating their commitment transactions to use a new format (even just a change in version number) might take time to coordinate, and that in the meantime we should simply use some other unique markers to identify those commitment transactions, and implicitly imbue such transactions with the v3 policy rules.  However, doing so would eliminate the ability to batch-CPFP several unconfirmed commitment transactions at once (although this isn't reliable anyway today, since the carveout protections don't apply to this case, but perhaps this sometimes works fine and is more efficient).\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me if that final step -- of imbuing transactions with v3 policy, rather than requiring explicit opt-in -- is needed before we move further forward with cluster mempool, or even if doing so would be acceptable to the broader community, but I think we could entertain that idea as a way to assist the LN project with migration and to decouple progress in this project from upgrade timelines in that one.\r\n\r\n### Feedback\r\n\r\nWhile we're still working out implementation details in the v3 and v3-sibling-eviction PRs, it would be great to get concept ACKs on this roadmap from any users of the current CPFP carveout policy.  In particular, please provide feedback on:\r\n1. whether there are use cases of CPFP carveout that are not covered by the V3 proposal as I described above, and \r\n2. whether the \"imbued v3\" behavior described above should be treated as a blocker for CPFP carveout removal as well, or if it's a bad idea due to (eg) breaking the ability to batch-CPFP (or any other reason)",

          "title": "[5/5]sweep: introduce budget-based deadline aware fee bumper",
          "body": "This PR introduces a budget-based deadline-aware fee bumper that solves the following issues,\r\n1. overshooting fees - the sweeper sometimes sweeps an input without considering its cost.\r\n2. RBF oblivious - the sweeper cannot properly create RBF-compliant txns.\r\n3. naive fee management - the sweeper relies solely on the fee estimator to make decisions on fee rates.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR and its dependencies have refactored the sweeper so it's easier to question its architecture and implement more advanced fee bumping strategies in the future. The dependencies,\r\n- #8345\r\n- #8147 \r\n- #8422\r\n- #8423\r\n- #8148\r\n\r\nReplaces #7549 and fixes #4215\r\n\r\n## Definitions\r\n\r\nA budget is the amount of sats you are willing to pay when sweeping a given input. Often the case, it's proportional to the bitcoin value of the input. For instance, say you are willing to pay 50% to sweep an HTLC of 100,000 sats, the budget would be 50,000. On the other hand, the budget is dependent on the context, or the type of inputs,\r\n- for a CPFP purpose anchor, although the value is only 330 sats, the budget would be the value under protection, which is the value from the incoming or outgoing HTLC with the smallest CLTV value.\r\n- for first-level HTLC txns, the budget is the proportional to the HTLC value although this budget cannot be directly spent from it because it must all go to the second-level HTLC, which means we need to borrow this budget from other inputs.\r\n\r\nBecause we define the budget beforehand, it makes sure we won't end up paying more fees than the inputs value.\r\n\r\nA deadline defines a time preference, expressed in blocks, that an input must be confirmed by, as otherwise we may lose money. Among all the outputs generated from an FC, only three of them are time-sensitive, detailed below,\r\n- `to_local` output, which is currently swept using a conf target of 6. There's no time pressure on sweeping this UTXO as it can only be swept by us.\r\n- first level outgoing HTLCs, which are currently swept using a conf target of 6. The deadline is the CLTV value from this HTLC's corresponding incoming HTLC, as if that CLTV is reached, our upstream peer can take the incoming HTLC via the timeout path, and our downstream peer can take the outgoing HTLC via the preimage path. In this PR, we use the `nLockTime` field as the deadline, as the deadline defines how different inputs can be grouped together, and because the `SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY` sighash flag, only the txns sharing the same `nLockTime` can exist in the same tx, thus we use this field as the deadline for outgoing HTLCs.\r\n- first level incoming HTLCs, which are also swept using a conf target of 6. The deadline is defined as the CLTV value used by the remote. Since we must already have the preimage to perform this sweep, we must make sure it confirms before this HTLC being collected by the remote via the timeout path.\r\n- second level transactions, which are swept using a conf target of 6. There are no time pressure here.\r\n- anchor output before the FC is confirmed, which is used for CPCP purpose. Atm we already have a deadline defined for this type of sweeping, and we will continue to use it.\r\n- anchor output after FC is confirmed, there's no time pressure here. Although it can be collected by anyone after 16 blocks (15 if the FC is confirmed), it doesn't provide many economical incentives to sweep it.\r\n\r\n## Design\r\n\r\nOn a high level, when inputs are added to the `UtxoSweeper` via the entry point `SweepInput`, the sweeper will periodically check their states and ask the `UtxoAggregator` to group these inputs into different input sets. Each set is sent to the `Bumper` to construct an RBF-compliant tx, broadcast it, and monitor it and perform fee bumps if needed. The `Bumper` will consult the `FeeFunction` to get a fee rate to use. In details,\r\n- `UtxoAggregator` is an interface that defines a `ClusterInputs` method which returns a list of `InputSet` interfaces. There are two implementations of `UtxoAggregator`, `SimpleAggregator` which retains the old clustering logic, and a new `BudgetAggregator` which groups inputs based on budget and deadline.\r\n- `Bumper` is implemented by `TxPublisher`, which takes care of tx creation and broadcast. It leverages `TestMempoolAccept` to make the broadcast RBF-aware.\r\n- `FeeFunction` is implemented by `LinearFeeFunction`, which is a simple function that increases the fee rate linearly based on the blocks left till deadline. There are more advanced algorithms in #4215, which can be easily implemented in the future.\r\n\r\n### RBF tx, not inputs\r\n\r\nThere's an alternative approach which quickly ditched due to its high level of complexity. In this PR, the `Bumper` will take the input set packaged by `UtxoAggregator` and perform an RBF on this set. Suppose a few blocks pass by, the `UtxoAggregator` may choose to package the set differently based on current mempool condition and the budget supplied. For instance, if a set of three inputs are made, but later on `UtxoAggregator` decides to create three sets, each containing one of the inputs. It would then be very difficult for the `Bumper` to handle the RBF. However, I want to mention it here as this can be a future optimization task.\r\n\r\n### No more repeated RBF logic\r\n\r\nPreviously we have implemented simple RBF logic and CPFP rules in `lnd`, while the actual rules can be [very complicated](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8148#issuecomment-1887625772). With the help of `TestMempoolAccept`, we no longer need to care about the implementation details about these rules as we can now use this RPC as a validator to guide us creating an RBF-compliant txns. The only downside here is for neutrino backends, we don't have this RPC available - we shouldn't give up tho, with the extra fee info stored in sweeper, we can still perform a native RBF with limited efficacy, since without a mempool, there's little we can do.\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n- [ ] add minimal RBF support for neutrino backend\r\n- [ ] fix `BumpFee` RPC\r\n- [ ] add unit tests\r\n- [ ] fix current itests\r\n- [ ] add new itests\r\n- [ ] add design diagram\r\n- [ ] add readme in sweeper\r\n",

So an attacker who simply did a straightforward pinning attack on an ephemeral anchor spend could force the defender to spend an additional:\r\n\r\n    20sat/vB * 1000vB = 20,000sat = $8 USD\r\n\r\njust to get their transaction mined, at almost no cost to themselves. We need a better solution than that. One obvious one would be to make the 1000vB limit much smaller, eg the same size as a 2-in, 1 out, anchor spend. A Replace-by-Fee-Rate carveout for this specific case is another potential solution. (and as @ariard mentions, replace-by-fee-rate in general is a solution; IIUC one-shot replace-by-fee-rate will be quite a bit easier to implement with the cluster mempool work)",

I showed that V3 does not, as attackers can still cause defenders to pay significant amounts of money in response to pinning attacks, and that the way we intend to use V3 with ephemeral anchors is quite possibly *worse* than the status quo as anyone can be the attacker. I also provided a simple fix, and some less simple fixes.\r\n\r\n@ariard has also been discussing similar high-level design considerations separately.\r\n\r\nThese are all items appropriate for high-level discussion to make sure the design of cluster mempool/V3 is correct and worth implementing (and in this case, I gave an argument that cluster mempool may be worthwhile without V3).",

My goal is to establish whether a particular set of policy rules would be a suitable replacement for carveout.  You and ariard are discussing pinning more generally, and I infer from your prior comments that you think CPFP is a mistaken idea to begin with.  So I assume that means you don't believe that dropping the CPFP carveout rule should be a big deal either, is that a fair statement?\r\n\r\nThat is fine with me, and I'll take it as a concept ACK from you that you don't think the cluster mempool efforts need to be gated on worrying about the effects of CPFP carveout.  However, I believe that there are users of the CPFP carveout policy that the software supports today, and I'd like to hear from **them** about this topic before proposing that we drop support.\r\n\r\nTake detailed discussions of pinning vectors and potential solutions elsewhere.",

The only requirement here, then, would be that any v3-auto-tx-type-match logic allow standard rules for transactions which otherwise match but which have in-mempool ancestors.\r\n\r\nI think that pattern-matching / imbuing v3 is doable (that sounds like a concept ack for v3?). Assuming sibling eviction in v3, so far, it seems like it applies nicely to existing commitment transactions without any modifications. On the LN side, the requirement is no other unconfirmed inputs in the child, implying no batching.\r\n\r\nIIRC during the meeting, people said that LND (cc @roasbeef) are the only ones who do batching?\r\n\r\nSupporting batched bumping is definitely a goal, and was originally part of the v3 design until we [realized](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038#issuecomment-1320295394) it created a pinning problem and couldn't support it.\r\n\r\nSince we're on the topic of not breaking the usage of past features, though, batched CPFP and CPFP Carve Out have always been mutually exclusive. The extra descendant is given a ancestor limit of 2, which means it cannot be CPFPing more than one parent (see [code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ac923e70e7cec603abd207f104dbabfe675d59b2/src/validation.cpp#L936) and [proposal](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-November/016518.html)). That suggests that there can't be any transactions that are relying on both features simultaneously, so supporting such transactions shouldn't be a blocker for cluster mempool.\r\n(^I know I don't have to explain this to you but wanted to write this explanation somewhere).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It seems to me that sibling eviction rules could efficiently handle the 1-child-multiple-parent cases, but I may be missing something. I thought that the rules could be:\r\n\r\n- a v3 unconfirmed transaction may have multiple unconfirmed v3 parents (but is limited by the 1000 vbytes threshold)\r\n- a v3 unconfirmed transaction may have at most one unconfirmed child\r\n- a v3 transaction that has unconfirmed parents cannot have unconfirmed children\r\n\r\nThose rules ensure that we have at most two generations of unconfirmed v3 txs in a package. When evaluating sibling eviction, it's thus easy to figure out the replaced package, it only consists of the sibling with all of its unconfirmed parents. We can then apply package RBF rules (not the current RBF rules though) to efficiently replace this, and it should be easier to evaluate whether it's more incentive compatible?\r\n\r\nIt does require different package RBF rules than BIP 125 though:\r\n\r\n- we mustn't apply BIP 125 rules 2 and 3\r\n- rule 4 should probably be replaced by an increase in total package feerate\r\n\r\nThis is probably much more complex than the current sibling eviction proposal, and I may be missing important details as well, so feel free to ignore!",

What I have understood so far is that we want to only consider transactions with no in-mempool ancestors, which have exactly two 330-satoshi outputs (did I get that number right?). Do you have more criteria we should be looking at?  It seems like a good next step would be for someone to code up something that tries to capture what you are talking about, and try to verify on historical data that it wouldn't catch anything it shouldn't.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

While I have my reservations about CPFP, the fact is we've shipped a lot of Lightining implementations that rely on the CPFP carveout for safety and we have to continue to provide that functionality for the forseeable future. Indeed, this complexity is one reason why I'm dubious about rushing into the half-baked V3 proposal, as the complexity of it will simply have to live on in mempool policy for a long time to come if we adopt it.\r\n\r\nSee: https://petertodd.org/2023/v3-transactions-review#recommendations\r\n\r\nI did not suggest that we get rid of CPFP in my V3 transactions review. Even though I recommended against shipping V3, I even said that we should try to ship package relay to make existing anchor/CPFP-using Lightning implementations less broken.",
