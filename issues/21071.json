    "title": "~~$1,500 Bounty for Offline Multisignature through the GUI~~ View #24861",
    "body": "There has been incredible work implementing descriptor wallets, PSBTs, offline signing, HWWs; and GUI support for it all into Bitcoin Core.  It has been incredibly exciting to watch!\r\n\r\nMy goal is to financially support developers to implement offline multisignature wallets into Bitcoin Core.  I believe we are almost there.\r\n\r\nI am here to humbly try to attempt to describe what I see, as a user and through talks with other developers, as the work that is needed to implement secure, offline multisignature wallets in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n1) A standard for Coordinating Multisignature Wallets, with an authentication scheme.  This is being discussed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18142).\r\n\r\nBlockchainCommons has done a lot of work around this:\r\n\r\nOnline Node Coordinator sends a 'Policy Request' to Offline Co-Signers, if acceptable, co-signers send a 'Keyset', and then get an 'Account Map' back.\r\n\r\nPolicy Request = empty descriptor\r\n\r\nKeyset = BIP48 path\r\n\r\nAccount Map = descriptor w/ no xprvs in it\r\n\r\nAND/OR\r\n\r\nCo-Signers send array of descriptors for all script types ([BCR-2020-015](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-015-account.md)) to Coordinator, Coordinator selects necessary descriptor and creates wallet, then sends 'Account Map' back.\r\n\r\nConcerns:  lack of complete standardization.  use of BIP48.  Names still up in the air.\r\n\r\n@Sjors also discussed the possibility of a 'Wallet Composer File' that could compose a wallet interactively, use future-proof syntax (can the signer decompile miniscript?), and support other capabilities.  Not sure how much work has been done on this.\r\n\r\n1 A)  The authentication:\r\n\r\nJust trust on first use, with warnings if data changes?  @benma has done great research and reporting on this:\r\n\r\nTo receive securely, the offline signers need to be able to verify the following:\r\n\r\n> The receive address, which has to encode the hash of an ordinary multisig redeem script with no other spending conditions\r\n> The key of the hardware wallet, which has to be one of the public keys in the redeem script\r\n> The keypath of the displayed address in order to avoid ransom attacks if no restrictions are enforced by the hardware wallet\r\n> The number of cosigners in order to prevent an attacker from adding more\r\n> The threshold of required signatures to not be higher or lower than intended\r\n> The xpubs of the cosigners in order to prevent an attacker from swapping them\r\n\r\nThe above is written for hardware wallets, but I believe any BIP written and code implemented should be for both HWWs and offline Core wallets.  With descriptor wallets, I believe a lot of the above authentication can be automated by the info in the Account Map that all offline co-signers have.\r\n\r\nTo send securely, the offline signers need to be able to verify the following:\r\n\r\n> The recipientâ€™s address, displayed and confirmed by the user like with singlesig\r\n> The change address, having the same cosigners and threshold in an ordinary multisig script with no other spending conditions\r\n> The change goes to an address at a keypath recoverable by the user\r\n\r\nI think all the above is very important, since there have been many instances of devices not properly implementing the above security measures, so having a BIP for devices/software to comply with would be important.\r\n\r\n\r\n@Sjors and @achow101 have been doing a ton of work integrating HWWs.  This looks like it will be merged soon: (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16546).  After that, the UI will be worked on (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/4), and there is a currently-closed PR for HWW multisig functionality on top (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16895).  Perhaps some of this code can be re-used for multisig with Core on offline computers, but I am not sure.\r\n\r\nI believe having this ability would be an extensive security gain (being able to create a multisig wallet with Core on offline computers through the GUI).\r\n\r\n\r\n2)  Represent multiple derivation paths with one descriptor (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190)\r\n\r\nSingle descriptors make creating, backing up, and restoring multisignature wallets much simpler.  For example:\r\n\r\nTo create a multisignature wallet in Bitcoin Core, you can currently:\r\n\r\n1. Create wallet\r\n2. Dump `hdseed`\r\n3. Create address, dump xpriv\r\n4. Repeat Steps 1-3 N times\r\n5. Create multisig wallet using descriptor containing all N xprvs (M of N multisig)\r\n6. Use the N `hdseed`s along with Account Map as backup\r\n\r\nHowever, the above wallet can not create change addresses.  You need to create (backup and restore) a second descriptor for change addresses, even though most of the descriptor is the same, except for the derivation path at the end.  This can be very time consuming/confusing for end users, especially when backing up by paper/hand.\r\n\r\nFor a comprehensive offline multisignature wallet, I believe this change needs to be implemented.  Currently in Yeti, we bypass this by recommending coin control and only sending entire UTXO's (which is a pretty bad user experience and short term solution we have chosen).\r\n\r\nSome users like setting custom change descriptors (for example, for sending to an application for mixing change) so I believe this should be able to be done behind expert options, and perhaps this makes a single descriptor less controversial.\r\n\r\n\r\n3)  QR code scanner (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/9913)\r\n\r\nQR codes are the most secure way to pass data between airgapped signers.  I currently have a $300 bounty on implementing this.  BlockchainCommons has a standard ([BCR-2020-005](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md)) that is compatible with PSBTs (multiple QR codes checksummed; or a single animated QR code), and has a C++ reference implementation (https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur).\r\n\r\n\r\n4)  After the above (1-3) is finished, I believe implementing offline multisignature wallets into Bitcoin Core will be possible.\r\n\r\nI am not trying to influence consensus (this should just be wallet code), and ultimately it is of course up to the developers and the community if these are changes that are good for Bitcoin, and if the above is how it should be implemented.  I am just trying to put all the thoughts/discussions down in one place.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopers who might be interested:\r\n\r\n@Sjors @gwillen @instagibbs @achow101 \r\n\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nI, Robert Spigler, am offering a $1,500 bounty for implementing 1, 2, 3, and 4 (standard for coordination of co-signers, single descriptors, QR codes, and offline multisignature wallets) in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nThis does not include the already existing $300 bounty for #3 (QR codes).\r\n\r\nThe bounty will be split between developers as I see most fair (author and substantial reviews/discussions).\r\n\r\nThe bounty has no expiration and will be paid in bitcoin.\r\n\r\nThe date is 2021-02-02.\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n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\r\nYGS81OAQfIV/MJFffSJ581uU6th1s+7g9nWjeT9vGqTSJbNd1P4=\r\n=Xm2a\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n",

(borrowed some steps from @jonasschnelli)\r\n\r\n- First phase: generate and exchange `xpub`s:\r\n  - Every participant generates an `xpub`: most straightforward is to create a new wallet, I guess, but how to get the `xpub` to share for a specific BIP32 path?\r\n  - Maybe #21277 helps here *but* it might be putting the cart before the horse: do we want the default non-multisig descriptors at all here? I don't think so.\r\n  - Share it with the other participants.\r\n- Second phase: Every participant imports the following descriptors using `importdescriptors`:\r\n  - Receiving  (`internal: false`) addresses are `wsh(sortedmulti(<M>,xpubA/0/*,xpubB/0/*,xpubC/0/*,â€¦))`\r\n  - Change (`internal: true`) addresses are `wsh(sortedmulti(<M>,xpubA/1/*,xpubB/1/*,xpubC/1/*,â€¦))`\r\n- Send funds to the resulting address (every participant should get the same addresses).\r\n- When making a sending transaction create one using `walletcreatefundedpsbt` (everyone can initiate this)\r\n  - Send the resulting PSBT to other users\r\n  - At least M users checks it with `decodepsbt` then (if ok) signs it with `walletprocesspsbt`\r\n  - Collect the signed PSBTs with `joinpsbts` then broadcast the resulting transaction\r\n",

          "title": "Who is the GUI being designed for? -Continued Discussion-",
          "body": "I'd like to continue the discussion from [#17395](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17395) over at the bitcoin repo started by @michaelfolkson. \r\n\r\nThe two questions posed by Michael a long with summarized replies from the original thread are below. As someone who is interested in contributing to the design of the GUI I've also included some of my own opinions throughout. \r\n\r\n> 1. Who are we designing the GUI for? Long term Core contributors (highly technical) that use the GUI on a regular basis? I don't know how many of these there are. Technically curious who use the GUI when they can't work out how to do something from the command line? Complete Bitcoin beginners? All of these groups? If it is the latter then we should all be under no illusions that compromises are necessary which will mean it is impossible for the design to be optimal for an individual group.\r\n\r\n> 2. Design preferences are subject to the \"sample size of 1\" trap where those reviewing GUI changes think they are providing feedback on behalf of a group that they don't belong to. A highly technical user just does not know what is optimal for a beginner. The only way you see what is optimal for a beginner is putting alternative GUIs in the hands of a statistically significant group of beginners.\r\n\r\n- The GUI is intended for 'power users,' not beginners, intermediate or devs. Power users being those who are technically competent to run their own node, have basic CLI skills, but are still more comfortable with a simpler UI.\r\n\r\nI think devs also fall within the user base albeit not as frequent as the power users (say if the dev wants to do a simple task in a few clicks). Over time and with good design we can include all users (see below).\r\n\r\n- In the future the GUI should also include beginners and intermediate users, although not at the expense of removing important features or negatively impacting security, privacy, control etc. \r\n\r\nI don't see this as an issue as good design should be able to cater to both experienced and inexperienced users. As an example see [this exchange](https://medium.com/lgogroup/introducing-lgos-trading-interface-77967e4e108e) which offers different interfaces for differing user skills - taken from [crypto UX handbook](https://www.cryptouxhandbook.com/user-onboarding). Good usability is synonymous with good security - Casa articulates this much better in their [wealth security protocol.](https://docs.keys.casa/wealth-security-protocol/system-design-principles/usability-is-security) \r\n\r\n- The GUI does not need to be flashy / modern looking.\r\n\r\nI agree with this but this is in many ways unrelated to good design. A flashy look can increase usability is not synonymous with Aesthetics. As long as its fulfills its job thats all the matters. At this stage that job being having any level of user being able to run a node and have a wallet attached to that node (whether wallet features are used in the GUI or \r\n\r\n- Designers need to work within the constraints of Qt.\r\n\r\nGood point to make but I don't think the constraints are as big as made out to be in the original thread. As Christoph Ono, who worked on the designs for the Monero GUI which also uses Qt, pointed out a small team managed to revamp the UI/UX of the GUI over a few years without too many issues, see [here](https://github.com/GBKS/monero-wallet-design). @GBKS \r\n\r\n- Having a modular GUI / multiple implementations to cater to different user bases.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above I think good design can cater to all audiences within the same app, having a modular GUI is not an efficient way to go about things in my opinion.  \r\n\r\n- What is the main purpose of the GUI? _\"Note that the GUI is needed for more than just the wallet... right now, it is the only realistic way for a normal end user to run their own node at all.\"_ @luke-jr \r\n\r\nLuke also mentions \"...Bitcoin's security depends on a super-majority of the economy using their own full node.\" This isn't possible without including beginner and intermediate users which can only be done through well articulated design. \r\n\r\nAlthough this will likely be a controversial take, is the discontinuation of the GUI once enough options exist outside of core for users to run a fully validating node an option? Projects such as [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel) and [myNode](https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode) are good examples of non-GUI fully validating nodes. If these become more popular among users for running a node than the GUI, is the resources put into it worthwhile when they could be applied to making bitcoins foundations even stronger?\r\n\r\n- Many usability improvements are being worked on on the technical side - [1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16966) [2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9483) [3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7949)\r\n\r\nWith initiatives such as [Bitcoin Design](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign) and [square crypto design grants](https://medium.com/@squarecrypto/bringing-together-the-bitcoin-design-community-b89e5fbe080f) on offer, many more designers are likely to start contributing to open source bitcoin projects like the GUI. It's important that discussions like this happen so that designers and devs are on the same page. \r\n\r\nI'd encourage devs to join the [bitcoin design slack](https://join.slack.com/t/bitcoindesign/shared_invite/zt-fv00xzev-mfHaAsexPsu~QBlufPxL~g) and for designers to frequent this repo and join in on discussions when they can. \r\n",

          "body": "@ryanofsky recently suggested that I should write an overview of how the various pull requests spread over different repositories relate to some bigger picture view.\r\n\r\nSee the [multisig tutorial](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multisig-tutorial.md) for how things currently work.\r\n\r\nI typically have the following future multisig wallet in mind to guide my thinking:\r\n1. a computer running Bitcoin Core holding one master key (key 1)\r\n2. one or more hardware wallets with additional keys, via HWI (keys 2 ... n)\r\n3. taproot keypath using n-of-n MuSig2\r\n4. a fallback with fewer keys after some time elapsed\r\n5. a GUI wizard to set this up (simple Python command line tool until then)\r\n\r\nThe descriptors for this could be hand crafted, but it would be nice to have:\r\n6. Miniscript compiler that can generate this\r\n\r\n**What's Missing?**\r\n\r\n- Taproot support for external signers:\r\n  - [x] #22558 (PSBT fields)\r\n  - [x] #23578 (External signer support)\r\n- [x] Timelock support for descriptors: this will be added along with full [MiniScript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) support in #24148 & #24149 (@darosior).\r\n- [ ] Ability to handle descriptors for which we have 1-of-N keys. Descriptor wallets currently expect the wallet to be either watch-only and have no keys, or to have all the keys.\r\n  - [ ] #25907 makes it possible to create a wallet _with_ a seed, but without any descriptors.\r\n  - [ ] The user would grab an xpub from it (#22341 ) to construct a multisig descriptor and then import that.\r\n  - [ ] PR's to move in the right direction: #23417 and #23544 (very draft) \r\n- [ ] MuSig2 setup and signing support, which requires:\r\n  - [ ] a BIP to specify new PSBT fields\r\n  - [ ] Bitcoin Core changes; no PR yet afaik, see #23326\r\n  - [ ] At least one other (hardware) wallet to support it\r\n      * I'll try to add it to [nthKey](https://github.com/Sjors/nthkey-ios/issues/74) as soon as libwally supports it, see https://github.com/ElementsProject/libwally-core/issues/300)\r\n      * I'm not aware of any hardware wallet working on this yet\r\n      * testing with two Bitcoin Core nodes is good start\r\n  - [ ] HWI changes: additional commands for:\r\n     - [ ] initial setup\r\n     - [ ] signing (although perhaps calling `signtx` multiple times with the right PSBT will \"just work\")\r\n     * doesn't have to be HWI of course, we would just add support new commands in the [external signer command interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/external-signer.md) \r\n- [ ] a simple Python setup wizard\r\n   * right now [Specter Desktop](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop) is by far the easiest way to setup a multisig wallet. But it's a huge dependency (including a bunch of NPM packages for their web interface). A simple Python script in contrib/ could call HWI to get a list of signers, ask what threshold to use, call `createwallet` to generate a blank wallet, fetch an xpub from it, and then call `importdescriptors`.\r\n   * the script could use [BIP 129 / BSMS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki) (perhaps initially without encryption)\r\n   * Specter doesn't set the external_signer wallet flag, so I have a trivial PR to do that manually: #21928 \r\n- [ ] a GUI setup wizard: once we have an established work flow, we would implement that in the GUI\r\n\r\n**Misc**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a PR that improves address display handling on the device: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24313\r\n\r\nEven better would be if we had a feature to ask the wallet for a signature to prove it has the private key (without passing that information to the outside world of course, see #24186). This requires BIP-322 support on our end (#24058), at least one hardware wallet to support it, and a new HWI `signmessage` command. Perhaps this can later be expanded to allow your device to prove that it (still) has the keys it needs as a co-signer.\r\n\r\nMiniscript compilers currently doesn't support Taproot (e.g. to find the optimal tree structure), but I'm assuming you can still hand craft a leaf containing MiniScript.

This doesn't work very well, because there is no (central) way for a developer to search for the bounty, or keep track of them.\r\n\r\n@Bosch-0 brough up https://bitcoinbounties.org/ but I'm not sure if we want to rely on a third party site, that lists other projects.\r\n\r\nI thought maybe a new label for bounties could be a good idea.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke wasn't sure this was a good solution, and brought up [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21071#issuecomment-1095005372) that we should discuss possible solutions in a separate issue.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?",
