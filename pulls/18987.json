    "body": "This PR proposes to introduce a new subsystem for anomaly detection and notifications of those for corrective behaviors. It showcases a proof-of-concept laying out the design of such a new system with a new heuristic.\r\n\r\nPrevention of eclipse-attacks and network partitions is critical for application security and user funds.  Beyond fork detection and obvious protocol misbehavior, Bitcoin Core doesn't implement any active anomalies detection. These vulnerabilities may be even more destructive for time-sensitive protocol with harder [security assumptions](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-December/002369.html), such as those requiring real-time block processing with regards to honest majority network. Active detection at the base-layer, where it's easier to monitor, may be used in two ways:\r\na) With an application, like a payment system or a LN node, cutting its deposit flow or closing its channels in reaction or stopping HTLC processing, and therefore limiting exposure.\r\nb) With an internal Bitcoin Core module, triggering rescue header-fetching -- see the [AltNet subsystem proposal](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18988) as an example of consumer usage.\r\n\r\nEven if notifications must be interpreted according to application requirements, such _automatic_ reactions, well-implemented, would be a positive increase for their security.\r\n\r\nDetection may rely on a wide range of cross-layer heuristics, including the local clock, packets RTT, ASN distribution among addrman, abnormal peer rotation, stalling or delayed block issuance, mempool congestion and bandwidth consumption surges. You may combine heuristics to increase confidence, but due to the p2p nature of the network or Poisson block interval false positives must be taken into account. Ideally consumer would be able to fine-tune their false-positives exposure with regards to application security and the cost of their reaction.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new module (`CWatchdog`), with low-reliance on other modules beyond synchronous events harvesting (`LogHeader`). Anomalie detections (`ScanAnomalie`) is scheduled each `SCAN_ANOMALIES_INTERVAL` on its own thread. Integration is done with `NodeContext`, making the module accessible to future RPCs. A subscription interface (`CWatchdogInterface`) is added, the model of `CValidationInterface`. This can host the actual fork detection in the future after refactoring `CheckForkWarningConditions`.\r\n\r\nThis new module, less intertwined with current code can be disabled by default, and only activated with `--enable-watchdog` by node operators willingly to use it.",

Being heavily optimized and at same time trying to solve diverse goals like reasonable network security , tx-relay privacy, hindering block-topology, peer diversity, ... a functional networking stack is likely unable to address aforementioned issues without [compromising](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17332) its [robustness](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/81503/what-is-the-tradeoff-between-privacy-and-implementation-complexity-of-dandelion/81504#81504).\r\n\r\nIdeally you want to address scenarios with higher security requirements like an exchange receiving headers-over-DNS to detect tip pinning. A conscientious user always relying on tx-over-radio for each of its coins sends. You can also think about a LN hub willingly to use a HTTPS connection to a block explorer for emergency tx broadcast or an SPV wallet receiving filters-headers-over-obfs4 to defeat local Internet censorship. Of course, you can still rely on external modules or project, but better integrating them with Core to ease deployment and combine them for increased benefits.\r\n\r\nCombining may make sense with regards to:\r\n* Solving _first-hop transaction relay_ by easing identityless broadcast as a best-practice through wireless communications or anonymous network without relying on any specific one.\r\n* Increasing _block mesh distribution_, if you have few power users receiving block from space or long-range radios and beaming them through any link to geographical-near other full-nodes may considerably increase network security by decreasing the chance of network infrastructure disruption.\r\n* Reactive behavior for LN node, you may detect an abnormal block delay by receiving headers-over-LN and use any link available to close your channels\r\n\r\nThere are more variables at play like _user capacities_, _disruption length_, _user block-time sensitiveness_, _disruption amplitude_, _information leakage_. Building a comprehensive model that cover everything is hard, even if there have been few [attempts](https://stanford2017.scalingbitcoin.org/files/Day2/Weak-Signal-Radio-Communications-for-Bitcoin-Network-Resilience.pdf). There are trade-offs, urgency filter-headers fetching from centralized service may prevent your node from being eclipsed at the cost of privacy.\r\n\r\nKeeping these in mind, introducing an alternative networking stack as PoC'ed in [AltNet](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18988) may be a long-term solution. While designing such stack, flexibility and modularity should be end-goals while minding per-user requirement, technical capabilities and unknown real-world topology. A generic \"drivers\" framework,  abstracting all of the link oddities seems like an interesting direction to explore. Use of these drivers should never be the default to avoid massive topology modification and be well-documented to let user pick up what suits his/her needs. If we have a robust, fail-safe higher half in the codebase, driver code may be in another repo within the bitcoin-core.org to avoid painful review process.\r\n\r\nSome may object that we can rely on Tor to further our goals with regards to anonymity and network censorship-resistant. However, a) Tor DoS is [an issue](https://giia.cs.georgetown.edu/~tavish/pointbreak-usenix-sec2019.pdf) b) bridge dissemination may not suit bitcoin security assumptions c) Tor doesn't seem to explore wireless communications d) we may still reuse pluggable transports like Snowflake or meek without being forced to pas through monitorable exit nodes.\r\n\r\nIf this proposal is evaluated as worthy for the project, there are a lot of design issues to address, like Rust vs CPP, architecture integration (new threads vs new process), the fanciness of new fetching logic, how to avoid a review iceberg like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17376 as a first step but instead privileging incremental steps, how driver devs may contribute to the project without understanding of other components allowing them to experiment with the protocol's unique flow semantic...\r\n\r\nSuch subject are hard to encompass so it's likely there are a lot of aspects not raised here. I'm eager to hear people feedback.",

          "body": "**As of 14/03/2022 (chain tip hash : 00000000000000000000628002621832be9281faf72c394e66a8bc8446f80c75), this project is under implementation in separate process relying on the multiprocess framework. See https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/56 for more information on current state.**\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce a new subsystem aiming towards providing a generic framework for integrating alternative transport communication channels inside Bitcoin Core. This PR is a functional proof-of-concept using LN transport protocol as a new link layer for header fetching. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18989 for high-level discussion and proposal merits.\r\n\r\n## The Design \r\n\r\nPrevious [work](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17376) has been attempted to increase network security and robustness by increasing communication redundancy. While being optional and fault-tolerant, these attempt don't scale well to integrate a wide-range of alternatives such as [domain-fronting](https://www.bamsoftware.com/papers/fronting/), [orbital communications](https://github.com/Blockstream/satellite), [amateur radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DASH7), [Tor pluggable transports](https://snowflake.torproject.org/), unlicensed UHF, Bluetooth, [I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/), Lightning[ Noise transport](http://noiseprotocol.org/), ... Each of these transports has its own availability, latency, don't bind to the Berkeley sockets model, are unidirectional, require custom peer discovery, are not suited for block traffic, ...\r\n\r\nThis proposal tries to overcome these issues by laying out a generic \"driver\" framework with its own new processing stack, thereby encapsulating per-transport oddities. It introduces:\r\n\r\n* Per-transport capabilities (`TransportCapabilities`). Originally declared by each driver, they abstract driver specifities to general flags, like directionality, protocol messages scope. They could be extended with further attributes, like max bandwidth for adjusted packing or \"privacy\"/\"trustness\" niceness of the link.\r\n* Abstract driver model (`CDriver`). Basically, it dissociate driver warmup, message preprocessing, sending and reception. Ideally you would want to load them dynamically.\r\n* \"Anycast\" header-fetching (`AltLogicValidation::BlockHeaderAnomalie`). After notification from the [watchdog module](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18987), it sends a `GETHEADERS` message to any peers supporting bidirectionality and headers processing.\r\n* Alternative processing stack (`AltLogicValidation`). Relying on its own threads, it manages drivers and may take action based on static logical capabilites instead of peer state, reducing likelihood of bugs. In the future, one could implement a more robust headers-syncing strategy like reverse-header or compressed headers. It may also leverage a [future asynchronous validation interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18963).\r\n\r\nThere are many advantages of this kind of design --, it is easy to integrate new drivers binding to an abstract class, it is easy to reason about due to logical capabilities and at the same time provides granular tuning due to the fine-integration with rpc. Peer discovery and policy or bandwidth/memory DoS-protection are all possible driver add-ons as well. One could envision an rpc like `sendemergencytx`, broadcasting a transaction on any transport protocol available, like a [LN's justice transaction](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/05-onchain.md#revoked-transaction-close-handling) after detection of being eclipsed.\r\n\r\nThis module could be made entirely optional at compile-time with `--enable-altnet` even if such integration with the build system hasn't been made.\r\n\r\nObviously this is an exploratory PoC, I don't expect code here to be merged. Beyond worthiness of doing this in Rust there are a lot of open questions, including the threading/memory model, interface with existing codebase, build system, resources consumption and fault-tolerance. As next steps, I would favor building on the multiprocess work and hosting this new network stack in its own to avoid any bug contamination from introducing complex driver. I encourage those with opinions on the higher level motivation and design discussion to leave their ideas on the linked issue.\r\n\r\nHigh-level design:\r\n\r\n\r\n              ___________            ______________________\r\n             |           |          |                      |\r\n             | CWatchdog |----------|  AltLogicValidation  |\r\n             |___________|          |______________________|\r\n                                               |\r\n                                         ______|______\r\n                                        |             |\r\n                                        |  CAltstack  |                                                         \r\n                                        |_____________| \r\n                                               |\r\n                                           ____|____\r\n                                          |         |\r\n                                          | CDriver |\r\n                                          |_________|\r\n                                               |\r\n                                       ________|__________\r\n                                      |                  |\r\n                                      | ClightningDriver |\r\n                                      |__________________|\r\n                                      \r\n                                                   \r\n\r\n## The Demo\r\n\r\nThis PoC features a header-fetching round-trip, leveraging LN connection protocol. Each LN node connects to its peers through an encrypted and authenticated channel. Since your LN peer must have chain access, you could leverage this privileged link to create a redundant chain access.\r\n\r\nUsing C-lightning [custom LN message support](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/3315) and [plugin API](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/doc/PLUGINS.md), we could embed directly inside `HEADERS`/`GETHEADERS` and realize a round-trip between 2 disconnected bitcoin nodes through their respective C-lightning nodes.\r\n\r\nFor this to work, you need to compile and run 2 C-lightning nodes,  each with its own data directory and launched with this [custom bridge plugin](https://github.com/ariard/bridge-layer). Once those LN nodes are running, activate bridges by `lightning-cli alice_on` and `lightning-cli bob_on`. The plugin doesn't seem to accept CLI argument so I had to hardcode some node addresses.\r\n\r\nThen compile 2 bitcoin nodes with this patchset. For one of them you must change the hardcoded port in C-lightning driver and deactivate the watchdog logic. Also, it would be best if you changed `SCAN_INTERVAL` to something reasonable, for instance 1 min.\r\n\r\nHigh-level setup:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 -->\r\n\r\n                    __________          LN_msg(`GETHEADERS`)                   ________\r\n                   |          |                                               |        |\r\n                   | CL-Alice |-----------------------------------------------| CL-Bob |\r\n                   |__________|                                               |________|           \r\n                        |               LN_msg(`HEADERS`)                         |\r\n                    ____|_____                                                 ___|_____\r\n                   |          |                 <--                           |         |\r\n                   |  bridge  |                                               | bridge  |\r\n                   |__________|                                               |_________|\r\n                        |                                                         |\r\n                    ____|_____                                                 ___|____\r\n                   |          |                                               |        |\r\n                   | BC-Alice |                                               | BC-Bob |\r\n                   |__________|                                               |________|\r\n\r\n                      HEIGHT                                                   HEIGH + 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning both nodes, they should automatically connect to the bridge, and after anomaly detection realize a header exchange, if one of them is at least one block forward (run `generatetoaddress 1 $ADDR`).\r\n\r\nOtherwise you may observe past logs:\r\n\r\nAlice:\r\n```\r\nÊ0-05-16T00:55:11Z Boostrapping Altstack\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z init message: Done loading\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z msghand thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z drivers-warmup thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z addcon thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z Registered driver with 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z net thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z altstack-processing thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z Clightning - Warmup\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z dnsseed thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z altstack-handle thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z 0 addresses found from DNS seeds\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z dnsseed thread exit\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z Clightning - Bridge connection\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z Registering node_id 0 with driver_id 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z drivers-warmup thread exit\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:16Z Block header anomalie detected - notifying subscribers\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:16Z Block header anomalie detected - Anycasting header fetching from 0f9188f13cb7b2c71f2a335e3a4fc328bf5beb436012afca590b1a11466e2206\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:16Z Clightning - Preprocessing getheader\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:16Z Cligthning - Bridge send success 71\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:19Z Cligtning - Bridge receive success\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:19Z Receive HEADERS from 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:19Z Receiver header 65084efeaffe9929de0a0bb747cf48ac7f9b4edb214b2d1ad2ea468977be8e1e vs tip 0f9188f13cb7b2c71f2a335e3a4fc328bf5beb436012afca590b1a11466e2206\r\n```\r\n\r\nBob:\r\n``` \r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Boostrapping Altstack\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z addcon thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z opencon thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z msghand thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z drivers-warmup thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Registered driver with 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Clightning - Warmup\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z init message: Done loading\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z dnsseed thread exit\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z altstack-processing thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z altstack-handle thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Clightning - Bridge connection\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Registering node_id 0 with driver_id 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z drivers-warmup thread exit\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:10Z Leaving InitialBlockDownload (latching to false)\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Cligtning - Bridge receive success\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Receive GETHEADERS from 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Fetch header starting from 0f9188f13cb7b2c71f2a335e3a4fc328bf5beb436012afca590b1a11466e2206, tip 65084efeaffe9929de0a0bb747cf48ac7f9b4edb214b2d1ad2ea468977be8e1e\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Sending back 1 headers\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Clightning - Preprocessing header\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Cligthning - Bridge send success 84\r\n2020-05-16T00:56:10Z Adding fixed seed nodes as DNS doesn't seem to be available.\r\n```",

The chainstate manager is primarily needed for the assumeutxo feature, but it can also simplify testing in the future.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this pull is to make the global chainstate manager internal to validation, so that all external code does not depend on globals and that unit or fuzz tests can pass in their (potentially mocked) chainstate manager.\r\n\r\nI suggest reviewing the pull request commit-by-commit. It should be relatively straightforward refactoring that does not change behavior at all.",

      "body": "Honestly, I've not been that far in the design of a specific hook interface servicing watchdog/statistical tools.\r\n\r\nThis PoC was relying on a `CWatchdogInterface` inspired from the current `CValidationInterface`. Though one of the prevailing feedback I received with this proposal was that it would be far better to have the module separated in another runtime, and even external to Bitcoin Core internals or build system. Thus letting _any_ module to be plugged in.\r\n\r\nOne solution I'm working on is pursuing on the work done by multiprocess with the newly introduced abstract interfaces (`src/interfaces`), where your potential external modules could be written in Rust to talk directly to core C++ code through Cap'n Proto or in the future another protocol (fyi, see https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/56).\r\n\r\nOf course, w.r.t to event collection, the USDT approach you're proposing sounds the right tool. One could imagine a watchdog module where the low-level event collection is gathered through tracing and the high-level corrective logic relying on a `*.capnp` interface, all bundled in the same runtime.\r\n\r\n> This could be done with the net tracepoints for inbound / outbound P2P messages. See this example https://bitcoind.observer/p2p-network-traffic and code https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoind-observer.\r\n\r\nI need to think more, but I think tracepoints could cover the whole range of proposed heuristics: local clock, packets RTT, peer rotation frequency, mempool feerate groups, ... ?\r\n\r\n> Let if you think this might be an alternative to a module in Bitcoin Core. Happy to chat.\r\n\r\nFirst impression, I think this tracepoint approach is far better than yet-another-non-critical-module in core for sure. Yeah happy to chat, on this PR, a new issue or irc :)",
