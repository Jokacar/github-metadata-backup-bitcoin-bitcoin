    "body": "As mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26451#issuecomment-1313934927 example 3:\r\n\r\nIf we do anti-fee sniping, the Bitcoin Core wallet has a 10% chance to back-date the locktime of a transaction to up to 100 blocks.  Electrum has similar behavior.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/48174c0f287b19931ca110670610bd03a03eb914/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L725-L731\r\n\r\nWhen spending an unconfirmed UTXO, it can happen that we back-date the locktime of our transaction to a locktime before the locktime of the unconfirmed parent. In this case, the \"transaction signed earlier but only broadcast now\" is unrealistic I think (please correct me if you think there is a protocol where this makes sense). This is a fingerprint that we are a Bitcoin Core or Electrum wallet.\r\n\r\nrelated https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26526\r\nelectrum issue: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/8073",

This patch would fix this incentive incompatibility, by requiring that any new transaction have a mining score (as defined by the minimum of its feerate and its feerate including ancestors) to be greater than the individual feerates of all transactions that would be evicted.\r\n\r\nBecause this new feerate criteria includes the ancestors of a new transaction in the score, we are able to eliminate the prohibition against including new unconfirmed parents in a replacement transaction, a slight relaxation of the prior rules.",
