    "title": "Address cluster information on coin control window",
    "body": "I found it is very difficult to maintain privacy on my transactions because it is difficult to keep the address separated. I'm trying to prevent my addresses to cluster together, based on the following definition:\r\n\r\n> Usually an adversary will try to link together multiple addresses which they believe belong to the same wallet. Such address collections are called \"clusters\", \"closures\" or \"wallet clusters\", and the activity of creating them is called \"wallet clustering\". ([source](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Blockchain_attacks_on_privacy))\r\n\r\nWhile the coin control feature helps with that, it does not show all the transaction tree, listing just the coin sources.\r\n\r\nI would like the coin control window display all the clustered addresses belonging to any given tree so I can chose better which coins to use.\r\n\r\n### An example tree ###\r\n\r\nGiven the following transaction tree (where up-case letters are owned addresses)\r\n\r\n```\r\na -> B\r\n  -> C -> e\r\n     |--> D\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two UTXOs that can be spend: `B` and `D`, both are change addresses, within the coin-control I can see that the coins were received from `a`, but there is no mention of `e`, and that could be actually quite important, if for example `e` does know my name. That would allow for example, prioritizing those UTXO to send more money to `e`.\r\n\r\nCould it be possible to add that information in the tree?",

          "body": "Financial privacy is an essential property of every monetary and payment system.  Without it the user's security is reduced due to targeted attacks, the freedom to associate and transact is limited, and their commercial interests may be compromised when competition can monitor their activity.\n\nThe importance of privacy was recognized in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, but the only approach available at the time (pseudonymous addresses) provides only limited privacy and what it does provide is highly brittle.  Advanced monitoring capabilities have substantially undermined this protection in practice, but at the same time technology has improved tremendously and we can now do much better than pseudonymous addresses.\n\nTightly linked to privacy is fungibility, an essential characteristic of a money like good.  When coins are overly distinguishable and people find themselves feeling obligated to consult (likely centralized) blacklists before accepting coins the utility of Bitcoin as a money is reduced.\n\nSome people previously believed stronger privacy was incompatible with public auditability, but just like digital signatures prove your know your private key without disclosing it we know that privacy and public verification are not incompatible in a very fundamental sense.\n\nBitcoin Core should have a comprehensive plan to give users state of the art technology in this regard, but we must respect the challenges of deploying new technology in an already existing ecosystem.  Progress can be made in a series of larger and smaller initiatives.\n\nThis issue with track other issues and collect discussion related to the overall strategy on this front.\n\nCurrently Open Issues (without pull requests):\n- Implement Coinjoin in walltet. #3226 \n- Change value privacy #6569\n\nProposed short term functionality:\n- Implement some kind of ephemeral (ECDH) address. \n- Improve privacy in coin selection\n- Include a private transaction submission tool enabled by default\n\nProposed longer term exploration:\n- Merkelized abstract syntax trees or other explicit support for script elision in the spirit of coinswap (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=321228.0) to keep smart contract terms as private as possible\n- Confidential transactions: What performance envelope, security considerations would we need from something like or zero cash to seriously consider it?\n",

That might be a good place to start. Starting with the newest unspent output in a wallet, recursively iterate over its inputs and change outputs to collect all related wallet transactions. Insert all of them in the first group. Pick a wallet output that's not in the first group, rinse and repeat. Once you have the groups, collect all its non-wallet destinations (labels) and origins (labels).\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n {\r\n    \"destinations\": [{\"label\": \"KYC place\", \"address\": \"3...\"}],\r\n    \"origins\": [{\"label\": \"Customer 1, \"address\": \"bc1...\"}, {\"label\": \"Customer 2, \"address\": \"bc1...\"}],\r\n   \"unspents\": [ same format as listunspent ] \r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    // second group...\r\n  },\r\n  // other groups\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally the UI coin selection tree would also have these groups.",

          "title": "Who is the GUI being designed for? -Continued Discussion-",
          "body": "I'd like to continue the discussion from [#17395](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17395) over at the bitcoin repo started by @michaelfolkson. \r\n\r\nThe two questions posed by Michael a long with summarized replies from the original thread are below. As someone who is interested in contributing to the design of the GUI I've also included some of my own opinions throughout. \r\n\r\n> 1. Who are we designing the GUI for? Long term Core contributors (highly technical) that use the GUI on a regular basis? I don't know how many of these there are. Technically curious who use the GUI when they can't work out how to do something from the command line? Complete Bitcoin beginners? All of these groups? If it is the latter then we should all be under no illusions that compromises are necessary which will mean it is impossible for the design to be optimal for an individual group.\r\n\r\n> 2. Design preferences are subject to the \"sample size of 1\" trap where those reviewing GUI changes think they are providing feedback on behalf of a group that they don't belong to. A highly technical user just does not know what is optimal for a beginner. The only way you see what is optimal for a beginner is putting alternative GUIs in the hands of a statistically significant group of beginners.\r\n\r\n- The GUI is intended for 'power users,' not beginners, intermediate or devs. Power users being those who are technically competent to run their own node, have basic CLI skills, but are still more comfortable with a simpler UI.\r\n\r\nI think devs also fall within the user base albeit not as frequent as the power users (say if the dev wants to do a simple task in a few clicks). Over time and with good design we can include all users (see below).\r\n\r\n- In the future the GUI should also include beginners and intermediate users, although not at the expense of removing important features or negatively impacting security, privacy, control etc. \r\n\r\nI don't see this as an issue as good design should be able to cater to both experienced and inexperienced users. As an example see [this exchange](https://medium.com/lgogroup/introducing-lgos-trading-interface-77967e4e108e) which offers different interfaces for differing user skills - taken from [crypto UX handbook](https://www.cryptouxhandbook.com/user-onboarding). Good usability is synonymous with good security - Casa articulates this much better in their [wealth security protocol.](https://docs.keys.casa/wealth-security-protocol/system-design-principles/usability-is-security) \r\n\r\n- The GUI does not need to be flashy / modern looking.\r\n\r\nI agree with this but this is in many ways unrelated to good design. A flashy look can increase usability is not synonymous with Aesthetics. As long as its fulfills its job thats all the matters. At this stage that job being having any level of user being able to run a node and have a wallet attached to that node (whether wallet features are used in the GUI or \r\n\r\n- Designers need to work within the constraints of Qt.\r\n\r\nGood point to make but I don't think the constraints are as big as made out to be in the original thread. As Christoph Ono, who worked on the designs for the Monero GUI which also uses Qt, pointed out a small team managed to revamp the UI/UX of the GUI over a few years without too many issues, see [here](https://github.com/GBKS/monero-wallet-design). @GBKS \r\n\r\n- Having a modular GUI / multiple implementations to cater to different user bases.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above I think good design can cater to all audiences within the same app, having a modular GUI is not an efficient way to go about things in my opinion.  \r\n\r\n- What is the main purpose of the GUI? _\"Note that the GUI is needed for more than just the wallet... right now, it is the only realistic way for a normal end user to run their own node at all.\"_ @luke-jr \r\n\r\nLuke also mentions \"...Bitcoin's security depends on a super-majority of the economy using their own full node.\" This isn't possible without including beginner and intermediate users which can only be done through well articulated design. \r\n\r\nAlthough this will likely be a controversial take, is the discontinuation of the GUI once enough options exist outside of core for users to run a fully validating node an option? Projects such as [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel) and [myNode](https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode) are good examples of non-GUI fully validating nodes. If these become more popular among users for running a node than the GUI, is the resources put into it worthwhile when they could be applied to making bitcoins foundations even stronger?\r\n\r\n- Many usability improvements are being worked on on the technical side - [1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16966) [2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9483) [3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7949)\r\n\r\nWith initiatives such as [Bitcoin Design](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign) and [square crypto design grants](https://medium.com/@squarecrypto/bringing-together-the-bitcoin-design-community-b89e5fbe080f) on offer, many more designers are likely to start contributing to open source bitcoin projects like the GUI. It's important that discussions like this happen so that designers and devs are on the same page. \r\n\r\nI'd encourage devs to join the [bitcoin design slack](https://join.slack.com/t/bitcoindesign/shared_invite/zt-fv00xzev-mfHaAsexPsu~QBlufPxL~g) and for designers to frequent this repo and join in on discussions when they can. \r\n",
