    "body": "### Description:\r\nI am trying to sign an input that was sent to a p2sh-p2wsh address, but signrawtransaction RPC method returns an error stating = Witness program was passed an empty witness.\r\nAll the data can be seen through pastebin \r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\nReproducible by following these actions (note that wallet does NOT know anything about address/private keys used):\r\nRelated address info (2of2 P2SH-P2WSH address): https://pastebin.com/TE1LrR44\r\n\r\n1) Raw transaction request/response:\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/r6HdMwsy\r\n\r\n2) SignRaw transaction request/response:\r\n1. - https://pastebin.com/2apuckBk\r\n2. - https://pastebin.com/SsszYS2w\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nI'd expect for it to sign a transaction just as if spendable input was inside wallet. Which I tested works just fine. I imported the address using import priv key->add multisig address->addwitnessaddress\r\nthen created a deposit to it and then spent it, transaction went through without a hitch.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nYou can see the result in step 2.2. \r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\nI talked about it at IRC bitcoin-core-dev channel with meshcollider. He said there might be an issue where I would need to pass in witness program as well to the signrawtransaction method and that it should add witness object if it is required since createrawtransaction method can't possibly know if output is plain p2sh or a segwit wrapper.\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\nI am running v0.15.1.0-g7b57bc998f retrieved through Ubuntu PPA.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "I'm working on a [paper multisig system](https://glacierprotocol.org), improving it to use p2sh-segwit instead of legacy p2sh. I'm using my own Linux build of Bitcoin Core tag v0.16.0rc3 and using bitcoin-cli to build transactions.\r\n\r\nI used `addmultisigaddress` to create a 2-of-4 p2sh-segwit address and funded it on testnet. I created a transaction to spend those coins using `createrawtransaction` and I'm attempting to sign it.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\nIf I provide no keys to `signrawtransaction` and let it use the wallet keys, everything works. But if I provide the keys explicitly, I get the error: \"Unable to sign input, invalid stack size (possibly missing key)\".\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\nI expect `signrawtransaction` to be able to sign the transaction using the explicltly-provided keys. (For a paper wallet, the bitcoind wallet will not know the keys or the multisig address.)\r\n\r\nThis flow works as expected when I use type 'legacy' for the `addmultisigaddress`. It fails when I use type 'p2sh-segwit'.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that it assumes it's legacy p2sh and therefore the signature fails. Shouldn't bitcoind be able to figure out (based on the scriptPubKey and the redeemScript) that this is p2sh-segwit, and construct the appropriate signatures? Or is there a different/better way to use the CLI to accomplish this?\r\n\r\n# To recreate\r\n[This script](https://pastebin.com/2KLHkV9Y) shows the problem. The final `signrawtransaction` step should succeed. [[output]](https://pastebin.com/k5wwERLG)\r\n\r\n# Ugly workaround\r\nI could use `addmultisigaddress` to teach the wallet about the p2sh-segwit address, and `importprivkey` to teach it 2-of-4 keys, then use `signrawtransaction` without providing any keys. [This](https://pastebin.com/MMJhWCfP) seems to work [[output]](https://pastebin.com/M5gw7FkG) but is very ugly because at the time of signing, I only have 2 of 4 keys, so in order to run `addmultisigaddress` I have to decode the redeemScript and parse its \"asm\" field to find the 4 pubkeys.\r\n\r\n# Related\r\nSomewhat related issue, never merged: issue #11693 and its associated PR #11708\r\n",
