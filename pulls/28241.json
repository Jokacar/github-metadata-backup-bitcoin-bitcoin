    "body": "This PR adds an index with the silent payment tweak for every transaction. It builds on top of #28122.\r\n\r\nIt also adds a `getsilentpaymentblockdata` RPC that returns an array of silent payment tweaked public keys, one for each qualifying transaction. \r\n\r\nThis index serves two purposes:\r\n1. Light client support, see [BIP 352](https://github.com/josibake/bips/blob/silent-payments-bip/bip-0352.mediawiki#user-content-Tweak_Data)\r\n2. A more thorough check than the test vectors; e.g. by comparing a checksum of the index for all of mainnet.\r\n\r\nBased on the index that was originally part of #24897.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] remove dependency on wallet (move `GetSilentPaymentsTweakDataFromTxInputs` and everything it needs out of the wallet)\r\n- [ ] cleanup various TODO's in the code\r\n- [ ] brainstorm updating index when outputs are spent",

Some pre-work to make this easier is done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28246 , which this PR now depends on. If you want to review this PR, please review these two first.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nThis PR is a child of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27827 and only implements the BIP logic without the wallet code. For the wallet implementations:\r\n* #28201 - implements sending\r\n* #28202 - implements receiving\r\n* #27827 - all three PRs together - this PR is meant for tracking progress and is useful for reviewers who want to compile all three PRs at once for testing\r\n\r\n## BIP352\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses strictly on the BIP logic and attempts to separate it from the wallet and transaction implementation details. This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing. Labels for the receiver are optional and thus deferred for a later PR.\r\n\r\nTest vectors from the BIP are included as unit tests.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing, it is strongly recommended you read https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458 and take a look at the reference python implementation on the BIP.\r\n",

This results in some things that would have given an address for P2PK scripts to no longer do so. This is arguably more correct.\r\n\r\n`ExtractDestination`'s behavior is slightly changed for the above. It now returns `true` for those destinations that have addresses, so P2PK scripts now result in `false`. Even though it returns false for `CNoDestination`, the script will now be included in that `CNoDestination`.\r\n\r\nBuilds on #28244",

          "title": "wallet: add `seeds` argument to `importdescriptors`",
          "body": "This PR introduces the ability to import BIP32 master seeds alongside xpubs. It currently expects seeds to be provided in [BIP 93/codex32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0093.mediawiki) either as a single seed or as a list of shares which can be assembled via Shamir Secret Sharing.\r\n\r\nIt could be generalized to other seed formats, e.g. a hex-encoding or the old `sethdseeds` WIF format, easily enough by just attempting to parse the input in those formats and retrying until we find one that works. (Though we must be extremely careful that these formats are unambiguous! If the user imports a seed they don't expect, which fails to match the one they've backed up, the result could be coin loss. For formats with no prefix or checksum, e.g. hex-encoded bytes, we may need to require the user provide a prefix or a separate flag.)\r\n\r\nThe motivation here is that users who are importing their coins from another wallet likely have them in the form of a public descriptor (probably one of the standard `pkh(BIP44/48/84/whatever)` ones) along with a master seed (probably in some seed word format, but this is easy enough to convert to a straight BIP32 seed with an external tool). The seed, presumably, they want to minimize handling of, while the descriptor they are likely to be copy/pasting from somewhere and generally being less careful with.\r\n\r\nTo import this into Core, they currently need to construct a version of their descriptor in which xpubs are replaced by xprivs, and import that. This is cumbersome and potentially dangerous. With this extra RPC flag they are able to separately tweak their descriptor however they need, and then adding their seed data, unmodified, at the last minute in one place.\r\n\r\nMy specific use case is: I have an estate planning document which contains careful instructions for reconstructing seed data from shares which are stored separately and externally to the planning document. Meanwhile, the document itself contains a public descriptor, with checksum already computed, which is stored in several locations accessible by an open-ended set of people. If I were forced to mix the secret data with the public data, it would increase the risk of leaking the secrets as well as the risk of losing the public part.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Other approaches, that I considered but chose not to take:\r\n\r\n* Extend the existing `sethdseed` RPC. This RPC is legacy-only and not supported by descriptor wallets, because it depends on the legacy \"bag of keys\" model where you could stick keys into the wallet and it'd \"just work\", often in surprising ways.\r\n* Add a new descriptor-wallet-based `importseed` RPC or something. This doesn't work for more-or-less the same reason; the descriptor wallet associates all its keys with `ScriptPubKeyManager`s, so we would need to add support for \"global keys\" somehow. This is a lot of work, lots of room for bikeshedding, and I worry that @achow101 will NACK anything that looks too much like a \"bag of keys\" model. (The situation would be much less bad than the legacy one, where 3rd parties could do stuff like mapping p2wpkh addresses to p2pkh ones and the wallet would just accept it ... but it would still potentially lead to user confusion about what exact conditions the wallet could sign for what descriptors, and it may constrain future wallet changes.)\r\n* Adding a `codex32(...)/1/2/3` xpriv format to the descriptor import format. This was suggested to me by @sipa and has the benefit that very closely matches the existing import model.\r\n\r\nPersonally I don't like the latter\r\n* for the reasons stated in the PR description -- I like my descriptors to be public, and my secret data to be limited to 16 bytes, and I think this is a common mode of operation for people coming from other wallets\r\n* ...and maybe worse, a common model for other wallet authors, who would refuse to nicely interoperate with this);\r\n* because it felt like enough of a change to deserve a change to one of the descriptor BIPs, but those are big enough already and it's hard to get tiny changes to propagate to all implementors of standards. Plus it felt wrong to couple codex32 with descriptors like this.i\r\n* because if you have multiple descirptors that use the same seed, it would force you to copy the seed multiple times, which is dangerous. (In some cases [BIP 389](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1354) will make this better, but it doesn't cover everything and anyway is not accepted or implemented yet. One thing at a time :))\r\n\r\nBut what cinched it, and made me switch to the approach in the PR, was that @roconnor-blockstream pointed out to me that the codex32 model means that you can't predict, at writing-down-the-descriptor time, exactly what shares you'll be inputting. And because descriptors have a checksum which covers their entire string encoding, this means that you can't predict ahead-of-timei what will go into the `codex32(...)` slot and therefore what the total checksum ought to be. And this means that either (a) you lose the descriptor checksum, which is a Bad Idea and also inconvenient for importers who' will have to construct a checksum with `getdescriptorinfo` to get `importdescriptors` to accept it, even though said checksum had never been used to protect data in storage; or (b) you modify the descriptor checksum algorithm to be aware of `codex(...)` and to skip checksumming the data inside of that. This means even more implementation complexity that other wallets are unlikely to bring in, plus the result generalizes less easily to other seed formats (e.g. hex) which don't have checksums of their own.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "In #27286, the wallet keeps track of all of its transaction outputs, even if they are already spent or are otherwise unspendable. This TXO set is iterated for balance checking and coin selection preparation, which can still be slow for wallets that have had a lot of activity. This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

          "body": "## For reviewers\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to make reviewing a bit more sane, I'm breaking this up into a few smaller PRs, but will keep this one open as the parent PR and keep it rebased on the child PRs. The main purpose of having this PR is to track progress on child PRs and also have an easy way to compile `bitcoind` with both send and receive support for testing. Additionally, I'll be adding more functional tests to this PR since it's much easier to test when `bitcoind` can both send and receive.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122\r\n  - Implements the logic from BIP352 without any wallet code. This PR adds the necessary cryptographic functions and implements the logic needed for sending and scanning. This PR also includes the test vectors from the BIP as unit tests. Both the send and receive PRs have this as a dependency. In terms of priority, this PR should be reviewed first\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201\r\n  - Implements sending in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to send to a silent payment address, regardless of whether or not the wallet can receive silent payments\r\n  - Ready for review, but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28202\r\n  - Implements receiving in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to generate silent payment addresses and scan for silent payments, regardless of whether or not the wallet can send to a silent payment address\r\n  - Ready for review but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n\r\nFor the silent payments specification, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458\r\n\r\n## Overall\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the full silent payments scheme: sending and receiving. The following items are not covered in this PR and are intended for follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n* Adding labels for the receiver wallet\r\n* Full RPC coverage (only `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` are covered in this PR)\r\n* Light client support (vending the tweak data per block, either in an index or to serve to indexer, such as electrum server)\r\n* Add benchmarks to validate that there are no DoS concerns for doing silent payment verification for transactions in the mempool\r\n* External signer support (dependent on hardware wallets supporting silent payments)\r\n* More unit / functional test coverage\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24897. Below is a summary of the major changes:\r\n\r\n* Remove labels\r\n  * The original draft included labels, but this has been deferred for a later PR. Labels are not necessary for sending and receiving and there are still some open questions on how best to implement them in Bitcoin Core. Labels can also be added at any point by the receiver without requiring any changes from the sender\r\n* Remove indexes\r\n  * In the original draft, indexes were used when scanning for silent payments and when doing wallet rescans. This has been removed in favor of using `rev*.dat` files for rescanning. It may make sense to add an index in the future, but for the purpose of vending tweak data to light clients, which is still an open question\r\n* Update to implement the most current version of BIP352\r\n  * Since the original draft, there have been a few changes in the BIP which are reflected in the current PR. Most notably, using 33-byte compressed keys for the silent payment address (as opposed to X-only keys in the original draft) \r\n\r\nIt may be helpful for context to read through the discussions on #24897 , but ongoing review should happen in the relevant child PRs listed above.",

This means that `CreateTransaction` is actually unaware of any user desired locktime or sequence numbers. This can have an effect on whether and how anti-fee-sniping works.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `CreateTransaction` aware of the locktime and preset input data by providing them to `CCoinControl`. `CreateTransasction` will then set the sequences, scriptSigs, scriptWItnesses, and locktime as appropriate if they are specified. This allows `FundTransaction` to actually use `CreateTransaction`'s result directly instead of having to extract the parts of it that it wants.\r\n\r\nAdditionally `FundTransaction` will return a `CreateTransactionResult` as `CreateTransaction` does instead of having several output parameters. Lastly, instead of using `-1` as a magic number for the change output position, the change position is changed to be an optional with no value set indicating no desired change output position (when provided as an input parameter) or no change output present (in the result).",

          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",

Seems much better to have a `ConstructPubKeyBytes` function that both PRs (and any future work) can reuse.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a function to do this and has the existing code use it. While the purpose is to introduce a utility function, the previous multisig code used `ConsumeIntegralInRange(4, 7)` which would have created some uncompressed pubkeys with the prefix 0x05, which is incorrect (see https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/57855/c-secp256k1-what-do-prefixes-0x06-and-0x07-in-an-uncompressed-public-key-signif)\r\n\r\ntldr; using `PickValueFromArray` is more correct as it limits to the set of defined prefixes for compressed and uncompressed pubkeys.",

          "body": "### **Issue:**\r\n\r\nSimply `DecodeDestination` does not handle errors where the user inputs a valid address for the wrong network. _e.x. testnet while running client on mainnet_  \r\n\r\nThe current error `not a valid Bech32 or Base58 encoding` for a valid address on a different network is entirely incorrect. This is because of the is_bech32 variable used at the core of `DecodeDestination` logic  only checks that the prefix matches. If it doesn't it just starts running everything as `DecodeBase58Check` regardless if the Bech32 String was actually valid.\r\n\r\n### **Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nBase58 Addresses with invalid prefixes will now display network and expected values.\r\n\r\n- previous: `Invalid or unsupported Base58-encoded address.`\r\n- 27260 `Invalid or unsupported Base58 testnet address. Expected prefix m, n, or 2`\r\n\r\nBech32 Addresses with invalid prefixes will now display network and expected values. The current from of the error is completely incorrect when the user passes valid Bech32 for the wrong network.\r\n\r\n- previous: `Invalid or unsupported Segwit (Bech32) or Base58 encoding.`\r\n- 27260: `Invalid chain prefix for testnet. Expected tb got bc`\r\n\r\n### **Reference**\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26290\r\n### **Implementation :**\r\nSimply put, don't delay the attempt to decode the string as Bech32 using Bech32::Decode(str). This takes a minimal amount CPU cycles to perform and is acceptable to do since this operation is not performed often. \r\n\r\nOnce you get the decoding status of the string as bech32, do the same with DecodeBase58 using a len of 100 and DecodeBase58Check. This gives you enough information to start properly decoding errors. \r\n\r\nAfter you have decoded the address in various formats run though the logic and display errors for invalid addresses with the network names and expected values when the user just misses the prefix.\r\n\r\n**Update 1**: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27260#issuecomment-1628375439\r\n\r\n### **Other Notes**\r\n\r\n- Previous errors had inconsistencies such as random periods in some errors and not others. Using the word encoded in some errors and not others. This has been resolved.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.

For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",
