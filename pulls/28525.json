This simplifies testing.",

This simplifies testing.\r\n\r\nThe reason for having a separate garbage authentication packet was to materialize the separation of the key exchange phase and version negotiation phase even in the bytestream on the wire. However, this is not necessary, and arguably, these phases are still properly separated: Since the AEAD will ensure that AAD (=garbage) is checked before looking at the contents (=version), the peers won't interpret version data before having authenticated the garbage.",
