    "body": "Right now existing change values are often very identifying.\n\nCoin selection could be smarter and try to result in change amounts that were more plausible output values,  this would likely also reduce overall transaction sizes. \n\nAnother approach applicable for larger amounts of change would be to have two change outputs and randomly set it to be one equal to a payment amount (and then the rest) or  each change output being half the change.\n\n(Improvements here were requested by Introshine on reddit)\n",

          "body": "Financial privacy is an essential property of every monetary and payment system.  Without it the user's security is reduced due to targeted attacks, the freedom to associate and transact is limited, and their commercial interests may be compromised when competition can monitor their activity.\n\nThe importance of privacy was recognized in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, but the only approach available at the time (pseudonymous addresses) provides only limited privacy and what it does provide is highly brittle.  Advanced monitoring capabilities have substantially undermined this protection in practice, but at the same time technology has improved tremendously and we can now do much better than pseudonymous addresses.\n\nTightly linked to privacy is fungibility, an essential characteristic of a money like good.  When coins are overly distinguishable and people find themselves feeling obligated to consult (likely centralized) blacklists before accepting coins the utility of Bitcoin as a money is reduced.\n\nSome people previously believed stronger privacy was incompatible with public auditability, but just like digital signatures prove your know your private key without disclosing it we know that privacy and public verification are not incompatible in a very fundamental sense.\n\nBitcoin Core should have a comprehensive plan to give users state of the art technology in this regard, but we must respect the challenges of deploying new technology in an already existing ecosystem.  Progress can be made in a series of larger and smaller initiatives.\n\nThis issue with track other issues and collect discussion related to the overall strategy on this front.\n\nCurrently Open Issues (without pull requests):\n- Implement Coinjoin in walltet. #3226 \n- Change value privacy #6569\n\nProposed short term functionality:\n- Implement some kind of ephemeral (ECDH) address. \n- Improve privacy in coin selection\n- Include a private transaction submission tool enabled by default\n\nProposed longer term exploration:\n- Merkelized abstract syntax trees or other explicit support for script elision in the spirit of coinswap (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=321228.0) to keep smart contract terms as private as possible\n- Confidential transactions: What performance envelope, security considerations would we need from something like or zero cash to seriously consider it?\n",

      "body": "There's a lot of trade-offs in coin selection, and a lot of the tools people are going to use to solve the problem (e.g. constraint solvers) aren't really realistically ever going to get merged into bitcoin. So how about instead we aim at making pluggable coin-selection?\n\nMaybe something as simple that pipes the target addresses and amounts, target fee (per kb), list of unspent, and a list of possible change addresses. The coin selector reads this in, writes out a set of inputs and outputs. Bitcoin could sanity check it, and then convert to a raw transaction and sign.\n\nHaving stand alone coin selection system would really encourage the development of good solutions, testing all free of the constraints of doing it from within bitcoin core itself :D\n",

Previously it used to hover around 10-20 unspent or so.\n\nFull dump of  [bitcoin-cli listunspent | grep amount](https://gist.github.com/RHavar/77cab9accc5c644fb64a) on bitcoin 0.12\n\nIf it helps, during the time period I have received about 2.6x as many transactions as I have sent. The average receive amount was 0.11 BTC, and average send 0.26 BTC.\n\nFrom the looks of it, it's as if it's trying to perpetually create change of 0.01 BTC, and never really inclined to spend from it. \n",

(If BnB doesn't find exact match, just resign yourself to creating change)\r\n- Use effective value for adding inputs.  \r\n- Aim for a target which is actual target + some minimum reasonable change.  \r\n- Consider inputs lower than the target value separately from inputs > than target value.    \r\n     -  If we can achieve target with lower value inputs, randomly add them until we are above the target and return.\r\n    -  If we can't achieve target with lower value inputs, randomly select one of the higher value inputs and return.\r\n    -  Handle edge cases where we can't create a reasonable size change, but do have enough balance.\r\n\r\nThe change from the existing Core fallback here will be that we are no longer spending uneconomic inputs, but we will still by default be highly consolidating as we are always combining lower value inputs to meet our target when possible.   When fees are lower, more inputs will automatically be available for inclusion.  Also when it's not possible to find a solution from lower value inputs, we won't always use the smallest high valued output.\r\n\r\nIn the future we can reconsider this 100% bias towards always using lower value inputsand consider other factors such as current feerate and size of transaction required in deciding whether to consolidate or use just one higher value input.  It may also be the case that Branch and Bound performance in finding exact matches improves when we more often use larger inputs and don't always get rid of our small ones.\r\n",
