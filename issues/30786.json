    "title": "Testnet4 consensus failure due to timewarp related \"softfork\"",
    "body": "#30647 was effectively a soft-fork on testnet4 with no activation plan.\r\n\r\nIt reduced the timewarp mitigation allowance from 7200 to 600 seconds.\r\n\r\nIt's enforced by folks running v28.0rc1 and recent master, but not by miners.\r\n\r\nThis causes new nodes to be stuck at block 42,335: https://mempool.space/testnet4/block/00000000542792e54a720567ba66157d48cdae7bfd01c1b678d0f07a2ed56e99\r\n\r\nAs observed on BitcoinTalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5499150.msg64488234#msg64488234 and pointed out by @garlonicon in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30614#issuecomment-2324516655\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution would for a majority of testnet4 hash power to upgrade to the release candidate and call:\r\n* `bitcoin-cli -testnet4 invalidateblock 00000000000000263393ce5f648afd53676f13d360cc9f264b89351623bf1242`\r\n* `bitcoin-cli -testnet4 reconsiderblock 00000000000000263393ce5f648afd53676f13d360cc9f264b89351623bf1242`\r\n\r\nThis would cause a 16+ hour reorg for any older testnet4 node that's not stuck. Users who upgraded their node _after_ this block was created, and accepted by their node under the old rules, can either wait for this reorg to happen, or also use the above commands.",
