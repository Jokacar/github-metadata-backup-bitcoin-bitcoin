    "title": "Disallow building fuzz binary without `-DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING`",
    "body": "Without `-DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING` the fuzz binary is less suited for testing puporses, because it won't crash on `Assume` and it won't work around fuzz blockers with `FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION`. Afaict, the only place where the fuzz binary is currently used without `-DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING` is in the macOS and windows CI jobs.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose that we split the CI jobs into separate fuzz-only jobs that use `-DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING` and that we remove support for building the fuzz binary without it.\r\n\r\nHistorically, we used to build most binaries by default (including the fuzz binary) to ensure that compile failures are caught early by devs. With the switch to CMake this is no longer the case and imo that's fine since compile failures would be caught by the CI or other devs that regularly fuzz.\r\n\r\nThis would also avoid the need for workarounds like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31028.",

      "body": "> I build with these options to be able to be able to know if changes not related to fuzzing will break the build.\r\n\r\nI assumed (incorrectly) that almost no one would be doing this anymore since building the fuzz binary is no longer the default behavior. What I'm proposing would require you to do a separate build with `-DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING=ON`, which is of course annoying if you just want to check that the fuzz binary compiles.\r\n\r\nAnother assumption I have (perhaps also incorrect) is that no one (besides the CI atm) executes the fuzz binary that wasn't build with `-DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING=ON`. To reproduce fuzzing issues one often has to turn on sanitizers or enable `Assume` crashes, which requires recompilation in any case.\r\n\r\nThe problem I'm trying to address is that we currently produce two different `fuzz` binaries i.e. the binary produced with `-DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING=ON` is different from the binary produced `-DBUILD_FUZZ_BINARY=ON -DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING=OFF`.\r\n\r\nThe solution I'm proposing is to get rid of the latter, because imo it is odd to produce a fuzz binary that is not \"build for fuzzing\" i.e. it doesn't have all the bells and whistles that one would want **when executing the binary** (e.g. to reproduce an issue). We can also make both binaries behave the same by turning the compile-time checks into run-time checks (i.e. your suggestion https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31057#issuecomment-2400559220).\r\n\r\nMy solution is flawed in that it makes checking for build breakage quite annoying. Perhaps there is a third approach that still allows to check for build breakage while not actually producing a binary that won't be executed (which would let us keep the compile time differences). I'd prefer to go with compile-time checks if we can.",

      "body": "I think I'm not clear on what are the drawbacks of the suggestion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31057#issuecomment-2400559220. It seems like that would fix the issues, simplify the build, make meaning of the cmake options clearer.\r\n\r\nI also like cory's suggestion of building fuzzing code just as a static library instead of as an executable if it really is not useful for any  runtime testing.\r\n\r\n>  Perhaps there is a third approach that still allows to check for build breakage while not actually producing a binary that won't be executed (which would let us keep the compile time differences). I'd prefer to go with compile-time checks if we can.\r\n\r\nOne approach I considered instead of defining global variable `bool g_fuzzing = false;` and setting `g_fuzzing = true;` in the fuzz binary was defining a global constant with weak linkage `extern const bool IS_FUZZING __attribute__((weak)) = false;` that could be overridden in the fuzz binary `extern const bool IS_FUZZING = true;`. This just seemed more complicated and less portable.\r\n\r\nIn general it seems like a good thing to avoid unnecessary differences when fuzzing and nonfuzzing, and to try to keep any differences that exist simple and easy to understand.",
