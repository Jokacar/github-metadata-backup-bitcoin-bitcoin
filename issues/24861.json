    "title": "Awesome multisig PR labyrinth guide",
    "body": "@ryanofsky recently suggested that I should write an overview of how the various pull requests spread over different repositories relate to some bigger picture view.\r\n\r\nSee the [multisig tutorial](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multisig-tutorial.md) for how things currently work.\r\n\r\nI typically have the following future multisig wallet in mind to guide my thinking:\r\n1. a computer running Bitcoin Core holding one master key (key 1)\r\n2. one or more hardware wallets with additional keys, via HWI (keys 2 ... n)\r\n3. taproot keypath using n-of-n MuSig2\r\n4. a fallback with fewer keys after some time elapsed\r\n5. a GUI wizard to set this up (simple Python command line tool until then)\r\n\r\nThe descriptors for this could be hand crafted, but it would be nice to have:\r\n6. Miniscript compiler that can generate this\r\n\r\n**What's Missing?**\r\n\r\n- Taproot support for external signers:\r\n  - [x] #22558 (PSBT fields)\r\n  - [x] #23578 (External signer support)\r\n- [x] Timelock support for descriptors: this will be added along with full [MiniScript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) support in #24148 & #24149 (@darosior).\r\n- [ ] Ability to handle descriptors for which we have 1-of-N keys. Descriptor wallets currently expect the wallet to be either watch-only and have no keys, or to have all the keys.\r\n  - [ ] #25907 makes it possible to create a wallet _with_ a seed, but without any descriptors.\r\n  - [ ] The user would grab an xpub from it (#22341 ) to construct a multisig descriptor and then import that.\r\n  - [ ] PR's to move in the right direction: #26728 and #23544 (up for grabs) \r\n- [ ] MuSig2 setup and signing support, which requires:\r\n  - [ ] a BIP to specify new PSBT fields (tracked in #23326)\r\n  - [ ] Bitcoin Core changes; no PR yet afaik, (tracked in #23326)\r\n  - [ ] At least one other (hardware) wallet to support it\r\n      * I'm not aware of any hardware wallet working on this yet\r\n      * testing with two Bitcoin Core nodes is good start\r\n  - [ ] HWI changes: additional commands for:\r\n     - [ ] initial setup\r\n     - [ ] signing (although perhaps calling `signtx` multiple times with the right PSBT will \"just work\")\r\n     * doesn't have to be HWI of course, we would just add support new commands in the [external signer command interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/external-signer.md) \r\n- [ ] a simple Python setup wizard\r\n   * right now [Specter Desktop](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop) is by far the easiest way to setup a multisig wallet. But it's a huge dependency (including a bunch of NPM packages for their web interface). A simple Python script in contrib/ could call HWI to get a list of signers, ask what threshold to use, call `createwallet` to generate a blank wallet, fetch an xpub from it, and then call `importdescriptors`.\r\n   * the script could use [BIP 129 / BSMS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki) (perhaps initially without encryption)\r\n   * Specter doesn't set the external_signer wallet flag, so I have a trivial PR to do that manually: #21928 \r\n- [ ] a GUI setup wizard: once we have an established work flow, we would implement that in the GUI\r\n\r\n**Misc**\r\n\r\nI have a PR that improves address display handling on the device:\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24313\r\n\r\nEven better would be if we had a feature to ask the wallet for a signature to prove it has the private key (without passing that information to the outside world of course, see #24186). This requires BIP-322 support on our end (#24058), at least one hardware wallet to support it, and a new HWI `signmessage` command. Perhaps this can later be expanded to allow your device to prove that it (still) has the keys it needs as a co-signer.\r\n\r\nMiniscript compilers currently doesn't support Taproot (e.g. to find the optimal tree structure), but I'm assuming you can still hand craft a leaf containing MiniScript.

Revisiting this I think could be good.  I typically build with `./configure --disable-external-signer`\r\n\r\nThat being said, my main goal is setting up (offline) multisig with Bitcoin Core, and I think it is many other people's goals to set up a wallet as you described in the OP - so thank you for setting up this umbrella issue Sjors! We are getting closer and closer to the final goal!\r\n\r\nI think some other PRs that could be good to add to the above tasklist would be:\r\n\r\nFor Taproot support for external signers: (Besides the already linked #22558 in the OP):\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23578\r\nThere's also an issue created in HWI repo to track Taproot support:\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/issues/501\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Miniscript PRs:\r\n- [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24860\r\n- [x] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/86\r\n- [x] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/89\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25540\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/87\r\n\r\nDescriptors\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22838\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24361\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/92\r\n\r\nThe GUI probably should be built with the new QML based fork? (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui-qml) @jarolrod @hebasto @Bosch-0\r\n\r\nGUI:\r\n- [ ] ~https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/9913~ https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/670\r\nPossibly out of scope (but nice to have):\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/537\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/562\r\n\r\nBIPs to be supported:\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki\r\nBIP 87 Is fulfilled by #23544\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki\r\n\r\nI had set a $1,500 bounty for a GUI in Bitcoin Core that allows for the setting up of an (offline) multisignature wallet (here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21071).  Since then, there's been further work and standardization on this project.  I am raising this bounty to $10,000, to be paid out in bitcoin.  Payments will be made in part as individual tasklists are completed; to be divided up to developers who worked on the code and helped review it; at my discretion. This bounty update overrules and succeeds completely the original $1,500 bounty.\r\n\r\n[Bounty_Signed.txt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/8506928/Bounty_Signed.txt)\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\nAddition:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The `GetExternalSigner` changes that will be needed as discussed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25235#pullrequestreview-989017687)\r\n\r\nAlso, ultimately:\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/pull/138\r\n\r\nSo that threshold spends can be implemented privately\r\n\r\nEdit: Damn formatting\r\n",

          "title": "~~$1,500 Bounty for Offline Multisignature through the GUI~~ View #24861",
          "body": "There has been incredible work implementing descriptor wallets, PSBTs, offline signing, HWWs; and GUI support for it all into Bitcoin Core.  It has been incredibly exciting to watch!\r\n\r\nMy goal is to financially support developers to implement offline multisignature wallets into Bitcoin Core.  I believe we are almost there.\r\n\r\nI am here to humbly try to attempt to describe what I see, as a user and through talks with other developers, as the work that is needed to implement secure, offline multisignature wallets in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n1) A standard for Coordinating Multisignature Wallets, with an authentication scheme.  This is being discussed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18142).\r\n\r\nBlockchainCommons has done a lot of work around this:\r\n\r\nOnline Node Coordinator sends a 'Policy Request' to Offline Co-Signers, if acceptable, co-signers send a 'Keyset', and then get an 'Account Map' back.\r\n\r\nPolicy Request = empty descriptor\r\n\r\nKeyset = BIP48 path\r\n\r\nAccount Map = descriptor w/ no xprvs in it\r\n\r\nAND/OR\r\n\r\nCo-Signers send array of descriptors for all script types ([BCR-2020-015](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-015-account.md)) to Coordinator, Coordinator selects necessary descriptor and creates wallet, then sends 'Account Map' back.\r\n\r\nConcerns:  lack of complete standardization.  use of BIP48.  Names still up in the air.\r\n\r\n@Sjors also discussed the possibility of a 'Wallet Composer File' that could compose a wallet interactively, use future-proof syntax (can the signer decompile miniscript?), and support other capabilities.  Not sure how much work has been done on this.\r\n\r\n1 A)  The authentication:\r\n\r\nJust trust on first use, with warnings if data changes?  @benma has done great research and reporting on this:\r\n\r\nTo receive securely, the offline signers need to be able to verify the following:\r\n\r\n> The receive address, which has to encode the hash of an ordinary multisig redeem script with no other spending conditions\r\n> The key of the hardware wallet, which has to be one of the public keys in the redeem script\r\n> The keypath of the displayed address in order to avoid ransom attacks if no restrictions are enforced by the hardware wallet\r\n> The number of cosigners in order to prevent an attacker from adding more\r\n> The threshold of required signatures to not be higher or lower than intended\r\n> The xpubs of the cosigners in order to prevent an attacker from swapping them\r\n\r\nThe above is written for hardware wallets, but I believe any BIP written and code implemented should be for both HWWs and offline Core wallets.  With descriptor wallets, I believe a lot of the above authentication can be automated by the info in the Account Map that all offline co-signers have.\r\n\r\nTo send securely, the offline signers need to be able to verify the following:\r\n\r\n> The recipient’s address, displayed and confirmed by the user like with singlesig\r\n> The change address, having the same cosigners and threshold in an ordinary multisig script with no other spending conditions\r\n> The change goes to an address at a keypath recoverable by the user\r\n\r\nI think all the above is very important, since there have been many instances of devices not properly implementing the above security measures, so having a BIP for devices/software to comply with would be important.\r\n\r\n\r\n@Sjors and @achow101 have been doing a ton of work integrating HWWs.  This looks like it will be merged soon: (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16546).  After that, the UI will be worked on (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/4), and there is a currently-closed PR for HWW multisig functionality on top (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16895).  Perhaps some of this code can be re-used for multisig with Core on offline computers, but I am not sure.\r\n\r\nI believe having this ability would be an extensive security gain (being able to create a multisig wallet with Core on offline computers through the GUI).\r\n\r\n\r\n2)  Represent multiple derivation paths with one descriptor (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190)\r\n\r\nSingle descriptors make creating, backing up, and restoring multisignature wallets much simpler.  For example:\r\n\r\nTo create a multisignature wallet in Bitcoin Core, you can currently:\r\n\r\n1. Create wallet\r\n2. Dump `hdseed`\r\n3. Create address, dump xpriv\r\n4. Repeat Steps 1-3 N times\r\n5. Create multisig wallet using descriptor containing all N xprvs (M of N multisig)\r\n6. Use the N `hdseed`s along with Account Map as backup\r\n\r\nHowever, the above wallet can not create change addresses.  You need to create (backup and restore) a second descriptor for change addresses, even though most of the descriptor is the same, except for the derivation path at the end.  This can be very time consuming/confusing for end users, especially when backing up by paper/hand.\r\n\r\nFor a comprehensive offline multisignature wallet, I believe this change needs to be implemented.  Currently in Yeti, we bypass this by recommending coin control and only sending entire UTXO's (which is a pretty bad user experience and short term solution we have chosen).\r\n\r\nSome users like setting custom change descriptors (for example, for sending to an application for mixing change) so I believe this should be able to be done behind expert options, and perhaps this makes a single descriptor less controversial.\r\n\r\n\r\n3)  QR code scanner (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/9913)\r\n\r\nQR codes are the most secure way to pass data between airgapped signers.  I currently have a $300 bounty on implementing this.  BlockchainCommons has a standard ([BCR-2020-005](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md)) that is compatible with PSBTs (multiple QR codes checksummed; or a single animated QR code), and has a C++ reference implementation (https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur).\r\n\r\n\r\n4)  After the above (1-3) is finished, I believe implementing offline multisignature wallets into Bitcoin Core will be possible.\r\n\r\nI am not trying to influence consensus (this should just be wallet code), and ultimately it is of course up to the developers and the community if these are changes that are good for Bitcoin, and if the above is how it should be implemented.  I am just trying to put all the thoughts/discussions down in one place.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopers who might be interested:\r\n\r\n@Sjors @gwillen @instagibbs @achow101 \r\n\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nI, Robert Spigler, am offering a $1,500 bounty for implementing 1, 2, 3, and 4 (standard for coordination of co-signers, single descriptors, QR codes, and offline multisignature wallets) in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nThis does not include the already existing $300 bounty for #3 (QR codes).\r\n\r\nThe bounty will be split between developers as I see most fair (author and substantial reviews/discussions).\r\n\r\nThe bounty has no expiration and will be paid in bitcoin.\r\n\r\nThe date is 2021-02-02.\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n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\r\nYGS81OAQfIV/MJFffSJ581uU6th1s+7g9nWjeT9vGqTSJbNd1P4=\r\n=Xm2a\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n",

Would be great for the GUI component of this effort was put towards the new QML framework. Imo putting a feature freeze on the widgets GUI and slowly moving towards QML as the project develops would prevent a lot of technical debt - something we don't have a lot of room for.\r\n\r\nTagging others on the project for visibility @GBKS @promag @Mogashni. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking ahead as to how an app like this would function, [Nunchuk](https://github.com/nunchuk-io/nunchuk-desktop) is a great example and imo easier to use than Specter. @hugohn \r\n\r\n",

See Electrum thread about the same issue: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/5715\r\n\r\nBonus points: it should also work with a protocol like MuSig that requires more than one round of communication.\r\n\r\n## Current situation\r\n\r\nI made a [tutorial and screencast](https://nthkey.com/tutorial) of a setup flow, in this case using two signers: a ColdCard  and an iOs app that I'm working on. It's based on the flow ColdCard uses to setup a multisig between two of their devices. [Specter wallet](https://github.com/cryptoadvance) uses a similar flow and the same file format, last time I checked.\r\n\r\nThe general idea there is for each cosigner to export a (JSON) file with information about their public keys, and for the other signers to import that. Derivation paths are standardised (see also #16895). All participating devices will derive the same addresses; the user just needs to enter the (same) threshold on all devices.\r\n\r\nThe above is pretty easy to implement.\r\n\r\n## Flexible signer policies\r\n\r\nThe above approach requires everyone to contribute a single key. Individual participants can't do fancy stuff like having their own internal multisig setup or some backup key after a timeout. Yet this could be very useful, e.g. imagine a user with two hardware wallets who wants to use an external service provider as the third key. That service provider may have some super fancy setup, but they don't want to ship custom software to the user, let alone merge their special sauce into Bitcoin Core. What if you could use the Green Address service, but with your favourite orange QT wallet?\r\n\r\nA more flexible setup could use miniscript, where each participant provides a policy language snippet they want to use. These are then aggregated with `thresh(M, policy1, policy2, ... policyN)`. The result is then compiled by a coordinator (one of the participants) and shared with the others. Each participant could use a simple public key, or some super convoluted scheme. The cool thing about miniscript if that each participant can verify, without understanding the policy of the others, that they indeed control 1/Nth.\r\n\r\nIIUC the plan is to [combine](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16800) the powers of miniscript and output descriptors, and eventually add that to the wallet. Hopefully this allows for putting xpubs and origin info in both the policy language and the miniscript itself.\r\n\r\nThere is no current plan to add the policy language to miniscript compiler to Bitcoin Core, but we can start with a naive concatenation of participant miniscripts. Also AFAIK existing hardware wallets don't support anything other than plain OP_CHECKMULTISIG (`thresh_m(2, xpub1, xpub2, xpub3))` anyway.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we would use future proof syntax like the policy language, but in practice \"compile\" only to trivial, non-optimized, miniscript(s) that match what we can already do with descriptors.\r\n\r\n## Wallet composer file?\r\n\r\nWhat I have in mind is to (wait for someone else to) design a (binary) format, perhaps similar to PSBT, to compose a wallet interactively.\r\n\r\nIt would start with a coordinator. They populate the file with the \"shape\" of the wallet (YAML for illustrative purposes): \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- descriptor: null\r\n- policy: thresh(2, participant_1, participant_2, participant_3))\r\n- participant_1:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n- participant_2:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n- participant_3:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the first participant, probably the coordinator, fills in their details. They can also list their (advanced) capabilities, e.g. if they're able to decompile miniscript or only understand very basic policies.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- descriptor: null\r\n- policy: thresh(2, participant_1, participant_2, participant_3))\r\n- participant_1:\r\n   - policy: c:pk([00000000]/m/48h/0h/0h/2h/xpub_1/{0,1}/*)\r\n   - can_decompile_miniscript: false\r\n- participant_2:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n- participant_3:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe file is then passed to participants 2 and 3. Participant 3 will have all the info it needs to construct a final descriptor (set), and it can prompt the user to \"commit\" to that wallet:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- descriptor: multi(2, [00000000]/m/48h/0h/0h/2h/xpub_1/{0,1}/*, ......)\r\n- policy: ...\r\netc...\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`{0,1}` is a fake descriptor syntax; for now you need a separate receive and change descriptor)\r\n\r\nEach participant needs to \"commit\" to the wallet, in the sense of storing it in their memory. This lets them display receive addresses, and it lets them check the change address before signing a transaction.\r\n\r\nIt then passes it to the other participants. If the devices all have screens, the user can now compare the first receive address as a sanity check.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core should be able to import this a watch-only descriptor wallet (or maybe it has one of the keys).\r\n\r\nIf any of the devices isn't smart / powerful enough to figure out the descriptor, then it needs to go back to the coordinator first. Conversely you could start with a round where each participant announces their capabilities (support for lock times, if they can decompile miniscript and understand their role in the top policy, taproot support, resource limits, etc). A coordinator can then propose a top level policy based on that.\r\n\r\nAdditional fields can be added e.g. to include nonces for a musig pubkey generation ritual. Also additional fields could contain friendly names for the participants.\r\n\r\nIdeally the whole thing is small enough to copy-paste or put in a QR code (e.g. bech32-ish encoded).",

          "body": "Implement a new trade mode for full onchain escrow. Compared to the current LN mode, it will allow for larger trades, fully trust-less pipeline and higher safety assurance (zero custodial risk). It will also allow users to sell Sats directly onchain (requested feature).\r\n\r\nThe onchain TR/MAST pipeline is potentially useful and wanted for other platforms such as Peach (@Czino) or Hodlhodl. In addition, there are benefits to find a joint solution for the contract and build shared libraries (back and frontend), e.g., higher security and scrutiny, lower dev cost, higher anonymity set for unlocking scripts etc. If a joint solution is desired, the libraries will be MIT licensed to be compatible with closed source models, otherwise we will stick to AGPL as usual for RoboSats.\r\n\r\nNote: I only know the very basics of Tapscript and MAST. So while I believe this feature is possible, some more experienced dev should take a look. Help is specially very appreciated for this feature.\r\n\r\n## Multisig Taproot/MAST contract\r\n*A brief description of what is wanted by a non-technical*\r\n\r\nOne can think of it as a 2-3 multisig. The buyer holds a key, the seller holds a key and the coordinator (dispute solver) the last one. This is, in fact, similar to the current model of [Hodlhodl](https://hodlhodl.com/).\r\n\r\nThe most common case is for the escrow Sats to be released to the buyer, so that TX should look like a regular P2TR. All other conditions are to be fully defined and implemented as MAST leaves. Be aware the next table can be buggy, incomplete, inaccurate or plain impossible. I did not study enough.\r\n\r\n| Case         | TR/MAST | Signers | Sats move to | Onchain trace |\r\n|--------------|:-----|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|\r\n| 1. Cooperative Success  | Default spending path | Buyer and seller | escrow to buyer, fee to coordinator | P2TR: 1 input 2 outputs |\r\n| 2. Cooperative Cancellation | Script_A | Buyer and seller | escrow back to seller | Reveals TapLeaf |\r\n| 3. Seller wins dispute | Script_B | Seller and coordinator | escrow back to seller | Reveals TapLeaf  |\r\n| 4. Buyer wins dispute | Script_C | Buyer and coordinator | escrow to buyer, fee to coordinator | Reveals TapLeaf  |\r\n\r\n### E.g. As output descriptor:\r\n\r\nP1 = Seller Pubkey\r\nP2 = Buyer Pubkey\r\nP3 = Coordinator Pubkey\r\n\r\n`tr(pk(musig(P1,P2)),{pk(musig(P1,P2)),{pk(musig(P1,P3)),pk(musig(P2,P3))}})`\r\n\r\n*Note `musig` is not a valid output descriptor. It denotes key information used to populate fields in the PSBTs participatns use to coordinate signing.*\r\n\r\n### Other comments\r\n\r\nThe seller will deposit the Sats into the contract either (1) when the order is created or (2) when the order is taken. The approach (1) will allow for much shorter trade time for order takers while (... but... difficult... how to write the contract if the buyer payout address is still unknown? (2) makes for less overhead for makers whose order is not taken and the Sats have to be returned (incurring loss of mining fees).\r\n\r\nAs for Schnorr signature aggregation [MuSig2](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1261) protocol seems to have good properties. Are there production ready JS/Python libraries implementing this protocol? LND on v0.15.0 has added experimental support for MuSig2 signing on `signrpc` https://github.com/guggero/lnd/blob/93e069f3bd4cdb2198a0ff158b6f8f43a649e476/docs/musig2.md . There also seems to be some work to add multisig (MuSig2) functionality to bitcoin-core https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24861 . We would still need this to happen on a light client JS app.\r\n## Tasks\r\n**General**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Settle for Taproot/MAST leaves that account for every case\r\n- [ ] Create Taspcript/MAST transaction templates ⚡600K Sats reward⚡\r\n- [ ] Write libraries for coordinator/backend: contract creation / signature agregation / tx broadcasting, etc. Python, and javascript if needed for Peach.\r\n- [ ] Write libraries for buyer-seller/frontend client: privkey/pubkey gen, signing and signature aggregation....\r\n\r\n*A client library should never sign an \"I lose the dispute\" TX*\r\n\r\n**RoboSats Specific** \r\n\r\n- [ ] Create onchain trade order Model.\r\n- [ ] Implement onchain Logics using libraries above.\r\n- [ ] New API endpoints (or enhance existing one for /order/).\r\n- [ ] Create new UI components and prompts for onchain trade pipeline.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's start with settling for a polivalent contract Taproot/MAST with leaves that account for every case. Brainstorming will be needed. If you know anyone interested and can help developing it please tag in comments. I'm tagging devs with good understanding of TR whose input would be very valuable: @sr-gi @esneider. \r\n\r\nWe are allocating ⚡**600K Sats in reward**s⚡ from the dev fund for the creation of the generic TX templates.",
