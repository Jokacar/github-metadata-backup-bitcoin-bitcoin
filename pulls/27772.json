      "body": "Rather than open more PRs that are duplicative of other recently rejected PRs, it would be more helpful to directly address the feedback that was previously given.\r\n\r\nAre you unaware that some of the DoS attacks that are prevented by our standardness checks include situations where a block might be mined that would take a very long time to validate, a cost that would be felt by the whole network?  See for instance https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=140078%7CCVE-2013-2292]].  It is absurd that this issue would be ignored in a PR seeking to change mainnet behavior.\r\n\r\nEven putting aside the network-wide risks, I think it would be inappropriate for this project to bless a configuration that could lead to our users allowing themselves to be DoS'ed, which seems like the obvious outcome (I have no idea how we would provide documentation to our users to do these risk assessments themselves).\r\n\r\nIn the most recent PR that tried to do something similar to this (which you also commented on),  I [asked for the particular rules that seem to be problematic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27578#issuecomment-1535568784) (for whatever use case is motivating these PRs) to be spelled out, so that we can discuss -- and perhaps there are indeed modifications to our rules that would be fine and beneficial to the network if we adopted.  If you'd care to do that here, perhaps progress could be made. Treating our standardness rules as a black box to be worked around, without any consideration for _why_ any of these rules exist, is not helpful and not going to lead anywhere.  Concept NACK.\r\n",

However, since there are pieces in various areas of the codebase and they can make progress in parallel, commits don't necessarily need to be merged in this order.\r\n\r\n**See #27463 for what PR(s) are open for review right now.**\r\n\r\n## Note to Reviewers\r\n\r\nThe major purpose of this PR is to solicit \"approach\" review.\r\n\r\nThis is a large project, and the first few p2p commits essentially define the interface. I'd like to get rough consensus on approach before we start looking at code details and merging PRs, because I believe it will help us \"get useful stuff in\" faster and avoid premature optimizations.\r\n\r\nHere are some questions I hope are answered before we try to merge anything (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27742#issuecomment-1572205313):\r\n\r\n1. Does the proposed protocol look sound?\r\n2. Are these 3 milestones appropriate?\r\n3. Is there important functionality that is in the \"todo improvements\" section but should be included in one of the 3 milestones? Alternatively, is there not-that-important stuff in the milestones that we should defer until later?\r\n4. Does it make sense to have this PeerManager <-> TxPackageTracker <-> TxOrphanage relationship?\r\n\r\n\r\nComments about naming, typos, code details, etc. are also appreciated but please note I may wait until their respective PRs are open to incorporate your comments. Thank you for your patience.\r\n\r\n## Project Structure\r\n\r\n### 3 Major Milestones\r\n\r\nThis project is split into 3 milestones, each of which gives us something useful.\r\n\r\n1. Modularize and improve orphan-handling (also some refactoring).\r\n\t- Introduce a `TxPackageTracker` class, responsible for orphan handling. It starts out as a wrapper for the `TxOrphanage`.\r\n\t- Use all announcers as potential candidates for resolving an orphan. Add a `TxRequestTracker` Orphan Request Tracker which helps track orphans we need to resolve. Preferentially request orphan resolution from outbounds, preferred relay, etc., over inbounds.\r\n\r\n2. When package relay peers are available, use `ancpkginfo` instead of missing parents when handling orphans.\r\n\t- Add `sendpackages` negotiation logic.\r\n\t- Add a separate rejections filter for transactions that are eligible for reconsideration when validated together as a package, so that children of low-feerate transactions are still considered.\r\n\t- Send `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO)` to package relay peers for orphan resolution. Use `ancpkginfo` to request missing ancestors through normal individual transaction relay.\r\n\r\n3. Download and validate ancestor packages using `getpkgtxns` and `pkgtxns`.\r\n\t- Add support for `getpkgtxns` and `pkgtxns`. Send a `pkgtxns` using the list of missing transactions from `ancpkginfo`.\r\n\t- Ensure we can process \"normal\" orphans even if a peer is trying to overwhelm/churn our orphanage. Do this by \"opportunistically\" protecting orphans from random eviction if they were sent by package relay peers, and redownloading orphans if we cannot afford to protect them. Each peer is allocated a certain amount of orphans they can protect at a time (\"token bucket\" style but the number of tokens is static for now). Outbound peers get more than inbounds.\r\n\t- If a transaction's parent(s) are below the fee filter, don't announce it (save the bandwidth of legacy nodes).\r\n\r\n###  Todo improvements \r\nThese could be added to the milestones or deferred until basic functionality is deployed.\r\n- Store orphans serialized instead of as CTransactionRefs to significantly reduce their memory usage.\r\n- Perhaps try to keep orphans in disk and/or process them asynchronously, given the incredibly DoSable nature of orphan handling.\r\n- Dynamically allocate tokens for orphan protection. For example, if a long-standing inbound peer continuously provides good packages for orphans, they should have more tokens. If a peer is obviously serving us garbage, reduce their tokens.\r\n- Detect when we have received all the transactions for a package, regardless of how (individual or block or other), and return `PackageToValidate`  in `GetTxToReconsider`.\r\n- New format for mempool.dat, packages instead of transactions.",

          "body": "This PR replaces the `m_recently_announced_invs` bloom filter with a simple sequence number tracking the mempool state when we last considered sending an INV message to a node. This saves 33kB per peer (or more if we raise the rate at which we relay transactions over the network, in which case we would need to increase the size of the bloom filter proportionally).\r\n\r\nThe philosophy here (compare with #18861 and #19109) is that we consider the rate limiting on INV messages to only be about saving bandwidth and not protecting privacy, and therefore after you receive an INV message, it's immediately fair game to request any transaction that was in the mempool at the time the INV message was sent. We likewise consider the BIP 133 feefilter and BIP 37 bloom filters to be bandwidth optimisations here, and treat transactions as requestable if they would have been announced without those filters. Given that philosophy, tracking the timestamp of the last INV message and comparing that against the mempool entry time allows removal of each of `m_recently_announced_invs`, `m_last_mempool_req` and `UNCONDITIONAL_RELAY_DELAY` and associated logic.",

Prior to this commit, if parents within the package relied on each other, we could end up (1) accepting a low-feerate child or (2) rejecting high-feerate parents. See the \"interdependent parents\" test case for a specific example.\r\n\r\nThis also includes some shortcuts to reduce the amount of validation work we are doing:\r\n- Don't validate the last tx twice.\r\n- If the last transaction is by itself, call `AcceptSingleTransaction()` instead of `AcceptMultipleTransactions()`. This skips `PackageMempoolChecks()` on it.\r\n- If a transaction depends on something that failed for a non-policy reason, don't validate it, just return missing inputs.\r\n\r\nThese smaller changes also reduce the diff of the main \"validate sub-packages\" commit: Instead of validating each transaction *individually* in turn, validate each one with their *in-package ancestor set* (excluding the ones that already made it into the mempool). This means parents with inter-dependencies are validated correctly, while we continue using aggregate totals for package feerate.",

The arguments for this include miner incentive compatibility, maximization of fees per block through next-block priority-competition, utility for merchants and consumers, intelligent double-spend risk mitigation, protection of the user space, and optimization of Bitcoin adoption, utility, and activity.\r\n\r\nI apologize for not yet having a reference link with full details of all of my arguments, but I am happy to interact with commenters on any arguments for a full RBF agenda here. I can also alleviate any concerns with current zero-conf acceptance risk mitigation.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate being heard, and having a fair chance to be reviewed and considered.\r\n\r\nI also need time for consideration because I am assisting some merchants and users with understanding how to interface with Bitcoin Core and what is happening, so they can express their support for this PR, and their value of zero-conf being useful as a service. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I am advocating for the Bitcoin network state that has thrived for its entire history so far, and asking that Bitcoin Core avoid steering policy.",
