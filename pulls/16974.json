    "body": "Instead of keeping pindexBestHeader set to the best header we've\r\never seen, reset it back to our validated tip if we find an ancestor\r\nof it turns out to be invalid. While the name is now a bit confusing,\r\nthis matches much better with how it is used in practice, see below.\r\nFurther, this opens up more use-cases for it in the future, namely\r\naggressively searching for new peers in case we have discovered\r\n(possibly via some covert channel) headers which we do not know to be\r\ninvalid, but which we cannot find block data for.\r\n\r\nPlaces pindexBestHeader is used:\r\n\r\n * Various GUI displays of the best header and getblockchaininfo[\"headers\"],\r\n   I don't think changing this is bad, and if anything this is less confusing\r\n   in the presence of an invalid block.\r\n * IsCurrentForFeeEstimation(): If anything I think ensuring pindexBestHeader\r\n   isn't some crazy invalid chain is better than the alternative, even in the\r\n   case where you are rejecting the current chain due to hardware error (since\r\n   hopefully in that case you won't get any new blocks anyway).\r\n * ConnectBlock assumevalid checks: We use pindexBestHeader to check that the\r\n   block we're connecting leads to something with nMinimumChainWork (preventing\r\n   a user-set assumevalid from having bogus work) and that the block we're\r\n   connecting leads to pindexBestHeader (I'm not too worried about this one -\r\n   it's nice to \"disable\" assumevalid if we have a long invalid headers chain,\r\n   but I don't see it as a critical protection).\r\n * BlockRequestAllowed() uses pindexBestHeader as its target to ensure the\r\n   requested block is within a month of the \"current chain\". I don't think this\r\n   is a meaningful difference, if we're rejecting the current tip we're\r\n   trivially fingerprintable anyway, and if the chain really does have a bunch\r\n   of invalid crap near the tip, using the best not-invalid header is likely a\r\n   better criteria.\r\n * ProcessGetBlockData uses pindexBestHeader as the \"current chain\" definition\r\n   of whether a block request is \"historical\" for the purpose of bandwidth\r\n   limiting. Similarly, I don't see why this is a meaningful change.\r\n * We use pindexBestHeader for requesting missing headers on receipt of a\r\n   headers/compact block message or block inv as well as for initial getheaders.\r\n   I think this is definitely wrong, using the best not-invalid header for such\r\n   requests is much better.\r\n * We use pindexBestHeader to define the \"current chain\" for deciding when\r\n   we're close to done with initial headers sync. I don't think this is a\r\n   meaningful change.\r\n * We use pindexBestHeader to decide if initial headers sync has timed out. If\r\n   we're rejecting the chain due to hardware error this may result in\r\n   additional cases where we ban a peer, but this is already true, so I think\r\n   its fine.",

While the name is now a bit confusing,\nthis matches much better with how it is used in practice, see below.\nFurther, this opens up more use-cases for it in the future, namely\naggressively searching for new peers in case we have discovered\n(possibly via some covert channel) headers which we do not know to be\ninvalid, but which we cannot find block data for.\n\nPlaces pindexBestHeader is used:\n\n * Various GUI displays of the best header and getblockchaininfo[\"headers\"],\n   I don't think changing this is bad, and if anything this is less confusing\n   in the presence of an invalid block.\n * IsCurrentForFeeEstimation(): If anything I think ensuring pindexBestHeader\n   isn't some crazy invalid chain is better than the alternative, even in the\n   case where you are rejecting the current chain due to hardware error (since\n   hopefully in that case you won't get any new blocks anyway).\n * ConnectBlock assumevalid checks: We use pindexBestHeader to check that the\n   block we're connecting leads to something with nMinimumChainWork (preventing\n   a user-set assumevalid from having bogus work) and that the block we're\n   connecting leads to pindexBestHeader (I'm not too worried about this one -\n   it's nice to \"disable\" assumevalid if we have a long invalid headers chain,\n   but I don't see it as a critical protection).\n * BlockRequestAllowed() uses pindexBestHeader as its target to ensure the\n   requested block is within a month of the \"current chain\". I don't think this\n   is a meaningful difference, if we're rejecting the current tip we're\n   trivially fingerprintable anyway, and if the chain really does have a bunch\n   of invalid crap near the tip, using the best not-invalid header is likely a\n   better criteria.\n * ProcessGetBlockData uses pindexBestHeader as the \"current chain\" definition\n   of whether a block request is \"historical\" for the purpose of bandwidth\n   limiting. Similarly, I don't see why this is a meaningful change.\n * We use pindexBestHeader for requesting missing headers on receipt of a\n   headers/compact block message or block inv as well as for initial getheaders.\n   I think this is definitely wrong, using the best not-invalid header for such\n   requests is much better.\n * We use pindexBestHeader to define the \"current chain\" for deciding when\n   we're close to done with initial headers sync. I don't think this is a\n   meaningful change.\n * We use pindexBestHeader to decide if initial headers sync has timed out. If\n   we're rejecting the chain due to hardware error this may result in\n   additional cases where we ban a peer, but this is already true, so I think\n   its fine.",

          "body": "This was actually the original goal of the Rust work, but we had to start somewhere a bit simpler. This adds a full parallel P2P client, written in Rust, which can download and serve both headers and blocks, listening on a separate port. It is designed to be simple and robust, letting the C++ net_processing handle being optimized. It avoids wasting bandwidth needlessly by not (like all Rust modules so far) starting up until either IBD completes or it seems stuck and by waiting 30 seconds any time it hears about a new block that it decides to fetch before *actually* fetching it.\r\n\r\nBased on (but could probably go in independently of) #16834, #16762, and #16974.\r\n\r\nSome tasks that need to happen to clean this up a bit:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Build out the Rust addrman a bit - it currently always queries DNS seeds until its built out a database of 500 addresses and then never changes it. I don't think this is a particularly terrible design at a high level for something with a goal of simply having a different failure model from the C++ addrman, but the over-reliance on the DNS seeds needs to go, at least (plus we dont want to ever query them after we've built up an addrman that works, eg upon upgrade).\r\n- [x] Build out connection logic a bit - we currently just open connections willy nilly very aggressively if our best header falls behind our best tip. This is great, but we should probably, like, disconnect peers that don't manage to help us along our journey (especially since the Rust code is hard-limited to 128MB of memory allocations, though this may want to change to 256MB, we have very little room for peers given our socket buffers are like 8-16MB just to receive a block and send one).\r\n- [ ] Support Windows. Currently uses poll() for socket handling and a pipe() to wake up the poll() thread. Needs a Windows version of that module, though that shouldn't be too hard...right?\r\n- [ ] A XXX or two, at least one of them probably requires @elichai explain Rust to me.\r\n- [ ] Subtree the libsecp bump, and the addition of rust-bitcoin crates (all managed in the rust-bitcoin org on GH by the Usual Folks) and libc crates (which just exposes libc functions and little more, though in theory we could probably drop this if we wanted to expose them ourselves, but it should be pretty simple). Subtrees are a PITA to handle, so this will just happen right before merge.\r\n",

      "body": "utACK 0a50019\r\n\r\nLet's say you have headers topology : \r\n\r\n\r\n          B - C\r\n       /\r\n     A \r\n       \\ \r\n         D - E\r\n\r\n\r\nIf `pindexBestHeader` points to E, if D or E are invalid blocks, block validation sequence is going to reset pointer to A until next header connection, after then it would point to C. Right now, pointer stays dirty on E until next header connection driven by `AcceptBlockHeader` logic, after then it would point also to C. So contrary of what I thought at first, this change it's not an event anticipation on what header connection logic would have done but a real (slight) behavior modif.\r\n\r\nDoes this change have meaningful consequences ?\r\n\r\n* GUI: getHeaderTip is used to display best known header, so yes that's a change but in anycase it's better to display a non-invalid one\r\n* IsCurrentForFeeEstimation: right now we wouldn't consider for fee estimation txn even if we may not be effectively behind due to our best header being in fact invalid (and assuming that's only header branch we have). With this change, we are going to consider txn for estimation while we may be behind due to other non-invalid header branch being hidden by proven invalidity of our previous best header. That's a change in the set of wrong-considered transactions but this one is more liberal (and seems better to include near-to-tip txn than dropping them due to invalid chain header)\r\n* assumevalid : if block failed before `hashAssumeValid`, pointer is going to be back to current valid tip, which is going to be part of the assumevalid chain but starting from then a new validation is going to start on another non-assumevalid branch on selection of which `pindexBestHeader` doesn't interfer even if still dirty. So no change here.\r\n* NotifyHeaderTip: called after `AcceptBlockHeader` in `ProcessNewBlockHeader` and before `ActivateBestChain` in `ProcessNewBlock`. Shouldn't see the difference\r\n* BlockRequestAllowed : if someone send you an invalid block, pointer is going to be reset to current tip and effectively offer a short grace delay compare to what it's now but this edge is flattened at next header announcement (and variance of their announcement is not meaningful compare to scale of STALE_RELAY_AGE_LIMIT)\r\n* ProcessGetBlockData : same analysis than previously, a bit more meaningful because HISTORICAL_BLOCK_AGE is shorter but it's not a sound attack to produce expensive block to gain potentially bandwidth beyond rate-limiting cap for a super slight delay from other peers\r\n* ProcessHeaderMessage: seems better to ask for headers from a valid starting point than a proven-invalid one\r\n* inv.type == MSG_BLOCK : same analysis than previously\r\n* strCommand == NetMsgType::CMPCTBLOCK : same analysis than previously\r\n* on block sync : going to lock us a bit more in initial sync but right now we would exit based on proven-invalid block so better\r\n* `nHeadersSyncTimeout` : invalid blocks is going to push backward `GetBlockTime` so may increase slightly timeout but is this going an edge compare to what an attacker could do with `nHeadersSyncTimeout` ? Don't think so\r\n",

      "body": "I see no problem with changing the definition of `pindexBestHeader` from \"best block header\" to \"best not-known-to-be-invalid block header\".\r\n\r\nIt feels a bit strange to only implement this as a reset when an invalid block is found, as that does not actually maintain the \"best not-known-to-be-invalid\" invariant at all times. Given the relative unimportance of `pindexBestHeader` maybe this is fine, but in that case maybe it should be documented as \"A block header that is at least as good as the active tip, and not known to be invalid. We optimistically try to keep it at the best block header under those constraints, but this is not guaranteed.\" or so.\r\n\r\nAn alternative (open for consideration, I'm not convinced this is necessary) is to build something similar to `setBlockIndexCandidates` for headers without the have-had-full-transactions requirements, and use its tip instead of `pindexBestHeader`.\r\n",
