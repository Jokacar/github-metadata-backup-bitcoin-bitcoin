But the reason why you can get this github response immediately – is – not at least, because SMTP was not indiscreet overloaded or over-evolved. \n\nIIRC `SIGHASH_WITHINPUTVALUE` is controversial (at least I read concerns from @gmaxwell and @petertodd ) and the way how the protocol can evolve is certainly not by opening issues here. Consensus and P2P changes need a BIP first, broad discussions and support for it. Closing.\n",
