          "title": "Limit on peer time offset must remain ~2x future time limit",
          "body": "There was some desire to reduce Future Time Limit (FTL) that nodes allow on timestamps in order to reduce the amount of short-term difficulty manipulation, if not for other reasons.  If it is reduced, then the Limit on Median Peer Time offset (LMPT) that's allowed should be reduced to remain about 1/2 the FTL.  If LMPT > FTL then POW security is reduced to 50% Sybil attacks on nodes.  This follows from distributed network theory that says 51% protection is achieved by having a synchronized clock (and signed messages which is achieved by block hashes).  But a synchronized clock obtained by a median is likewise a distributed consensus, and lack of a synchronize clock that it in turn can depend on restricts it to 33% protection.  Destruction of the synchronized clock implies POW protection might be reduced to 33%, but it's not designed for that transition.  The ultimate source of reliable time for POW is the nodes independently knowing the time based on an oracle, its admin, who should not code it to be based on GPS or NTP which could be subject to a central-source attack, if the majority of admins are doing the same. The specific lines of code are:\r\n \r\nFTL:\r\nhttps://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/0a31c163c68b9875c101df544c7c167952ae4f43/src/main.cpp#L3696\r\n\r\nLMPT:\r\nhttps://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/0f091f228cdb1793a10ea59f82b7c7f0b93edb7a/src/timedata.cpp#L82\r\n\r\nIt should have been coded as a single constant in BTC: \r\nFTL = 2\\*LMPT\r\n\r\nAn example of an attack: if a Sybil attack delays time to a few seconds before current time, no honest timestamp blocks would be accepted. If it delays it to before the MTP, no blocks can be accepted until the attack stops.  The biggest miner ignoring the node refusals (in effect a private mine) would win the chain when the attack stops.  There are 2 ways to do a double spend without a lot of hashrate.  \r\n\r\nCorrected:  a node looking directly at peer's times instead of through a network of relays requires a 50% instead of 33% Sybil attack.
