          "body": "Messages in Bitcoin are structured, so a fuzzer that was written on structured data might be practically more efficient than our current \"blind\" fuzzers. https://github.com/google/libprotobuf-mutator looks like a good place to start. The goal of this issue is to write one (or more) fuzzers that are based on structured input data. For example, a transaction or PSBT could be expressed in a structured way and fed into the existing tx or psbt fuzz paths.\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful skills: Background in fuzzing and structured data formats\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nWant to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this. You are encouraged to comment on the issue if you are planning to work on it. This will help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed and is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
