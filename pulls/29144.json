See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29144#pullrequestreview-1798109497.\r\nStating that the file is JSON-formatted and auto-generated gives bitcoind users another hint over what they can and can't do.\r\n\r\nI see your point, @furszy \r\n\r\nBut I think my points still apply to creating an \"auto-generated\" file.\r\n\r\n1. A regular user might not tinker with their settings file regularly and hence the \"this file is auto-generated\" might go unnoticed by the user essentially making the message irrelevant.\r\n\r\n2. If a user had a _custom_ set of settings and later loses them to corruption, they might not know that this has happened for a while if they are not given an \"on-the-face\" alert. And for critical software such as bitcoind, this seems to me a non-optimal behavior.\r\n\r\nI think it's a great idea to help the user with an auto-generated file in case of setting loss. But in the absence of an \"on-the-face\" alert, that change loses much of its significance. ",

Would suggest maybe \"Settings file %s does not contain valid JSON. This is probably caused by disk corruption or a crash, and can be fixed by removing the file, which will reset settings to default values.\" This would probably work OK for both command line and GUI (since the GUI already offers the option to reset the settings see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/379).\r\n\r\nAs far as adding a comments to the settings file, I'm not sure it would necessarily help in the reported case from https://community.umbrel.com/t/bitcoin-docker-container-keeps-restarting/2144, but it probably depends on whatever caused the settings file to be truncated or created empty in that case, and it could be a good idea to add comments to the file regardless.

This seems like a helpful change.\r\n\r\nBut It does seem unfortunate that both of the commits here make tests more verbose and repetitive. And the tests even before this PR were probably unnecessarily fragile. But I'm not sure I see a better way to write the tests, or a way to avoid the repetition of warning and error messages. If anybody has any ideas on how to improve the tests here, I'd be interested to know.",
