    "body": "I am seeing a couple of issues been raised in the past. We currently experiencing the same issue.  The work around was to delete `fee_estimate.dat` and `mempool.dat` from the node. \r\n\r\nWith regards to the below comment from issue 19150 (_Originally posted by @maflcko in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19150#issuecomment-638092106_), I would like know what are the recommended config we can apply?  Or is there a better way to manage this error?  \r\n\r\n```\r\nIt is only possible to estimate fees when you have enough mempool transactions from the outside p2p network\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we encounter the error, after deleting the 2 dat files, the nodes will take some time to catch up and fetch new fee.  I would like to check if there will be any alternative fee that user can manually calculate such as using `minRelayTxFee` ? \r\n\r\n            ",
