      "body": "This is somewhat hackish, but a very small change, in case it is desired for 22.0.\r\n\r\nThe underlying problem is that `CNetAddr::GetGroup()` (edit: this is now `NetGroupManager::GetGroup()`) and the places where it is called are build around the assumption that it is easier to obtain addresses with common prefix (e.g. belonging to one IP subnet). However this assumption is not true for Tor, I2P and CJDNS addresses.\r\n\r\nFor example, we would avoid connecting to `aabcd.onion` if we already have connection to `aaxyz.onion`, assuming that the common prefix makes it more likely they belong to the same actor.\r\n\r\n~`CNetAddr::GetGroup()`~ `NetGroupManager::GetGroup` only makes sense for the IPv4 and IPv6 networks. To resolve this properly a bigger refactor would be required - where we call `GetGroup()` only for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and treat Tor/I2P/CJDNS separately.\r\n",

This PR makes all Tor sources be treated as a single source, so the same address received from different Tor sources will end up in the same bucket/position. Overall, all addresses received by Tor sources will be dispersed amongst 64 `ADDRMAN_NEW_BUCKETS_PER_SOURCE_GROUP` buckets.\r\n\r\nNotice that this is already the case for Tor peers that have connected to us (incoming from our point of view) because all of them look to us as coming from `127.0.0.1`, so all of them belong to a single group. This plays nicely because an attacker looking to fill a victim's addrman new buckets can generate many different Tor addresses and connect from all of them to the victim (mimicking different sources), but all will be treated as one source (`127.0.0.1`). This is not the case for I2P and CJDNS.\r\n\r\nMaybe this patch is too aggressive and should treat as one group sources that are incoming Tor/I2P/CJDNS and leave the 16 groups (4 bits) for sources that we have connected to (outgoing).",

          "body": "CJDNS overview\r\n=====\r\n\r\nCJDNS is like a distributed, shared VPN with multiple entry points where every participant can reach any other participant. All participants use addresses from the `fc00::/8` network (reserved IPv6 range). Installation and configuration is done outside of applications, similarly to VPN (either in the host/OS or on the network router).\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n=====\r\n\r\nEven without this PR it is possible to connect two Bitcoin Core nodes through CJDNS manually by using e.g. `-addnode` in environments where CJDNS is set up. However, this PR is necessary for address relay to work properly and automatic connections to be made to CJDNS peers. I.e. to make CJDNS a first class citizen network like IPv4, IPv6, Tor and I2P.\r\n\r\nConsiderations\r\n=====\r\n\r\nAn address from the `fc00::/8` network, could mean two things:\r\n1. Part of a local network, as defined in RFC 4193. Like `10.0.0.0/8`. Bitcoin Core could be running on a machine with such address and have peers with those (e.g. in a local network), but those addresses are not relayed to other peers because they are not globally routable on the internet.\r\n2. Part of the CJDNS network. This is like Tor or I2P - if we have connectivity to that network then we could reach such peers and we do relay them to other peers.\r\n\r\nSo, Bitcoin Core needs to be able to tell which one is it when it encounters a bare `fc00::/8` address, e.g. from `-externalip=` or by looking up the machine's own addresses. Thus a new config option is introduced `-cjdnsreachable`:\r\n* `-cjdnsreachable=0`: it is assumed a `fc00::/8` address is a private IPv6 (1.)\r\n* `-cjdnsreachable=1`: it is assumed a `fc00::/8` address is a CJDNS one (2.)\r\n\r\nAfter setting up CJDNS outside of Bitcoin Core, a node operator only needs to enable this option.\r\nAddresses from P2P relay/gossip don't need that because they are properly tagged as IPv6 or as CJDNS.\r\n\r\nFor testing\r\n=====\r\n```\r\n[fc32:17ea:e415:c3bf:9808:149d:b5a2:c9aa]:8333\r\n[fc68:7026:cb27:b014:5910:e609:dcdb:22a2]:8333\r\n[fcb3:dc50:e1ae:7998:7dc0:7fa6:4582:8e46]:8333\r\n[fcc7:be49:ccd1:dc91:3125:f0da:457d:8ce]:8333\r\n[fcf2:d9e:3a25:4eef:8f84:251b:1b4d:c596]:8333\r\n```",

      "body": "> We'd only ever use 64 of the 1024 buckets for addrs received from Tor addresses\r\n\r\n> Correct. This PR makes all Tor sources be treated as a single source, so the same address received from different Tor sources will end up in the same bucket/position. Overall, all addresses received by Tor sources will be dispersed amongst 64 `ADDRMAN_NEW_BUCKETS_PER_SOURCE_GROUP` buckets.\r\n\r\nI think that we were both wrong above, it's much less than that, let's say we run `-onlynet=onion` and don't allow inbounds:\r\nIn that case, the only entropy in `GetNewBucket()` comes from `netgroupman.GetGroup(*this)`, the netgroup of the addr itself. This is only 4 bits, so tor addresses can only go into 16 buckets \r\n(if we are very lucky! Depending on `nKey`, some of these 16 values likely hash to the same value modulo `ADDRMAN_NEW_BUCKETS_PER_SOURCE_GROUP`, so usually it's more like 12-15 buckets). That means we'd likely be able to store less than 1024 onion addresses in the new tables (as opposed to >10000 on master). \r\n\r\nConsidering how large the tor network has become and how common it has become to run `-onlynet=tor` despite the higher eclipse risks (see e.g. https://bitnodes.io/nodes/) that reduction seems too drastic to me.

This does not apply however for Tor, I2P and CJDNS where the address is \"random\" bytes. Actually, Tor, I2P and CJDNS addresses that have common prefix are _harder_ to obtain than ones that don't have a common prefix (the opposite compared to IP).\r\n\r\nCurrently `NetGroupManager::GetGroup()` is doing prefixing on Tor, I2P and CJDNS addresses and assumes same properties apply as for IP addresses. This magically \"works\" to some extent but has drawbacks. Some serious changes are needed to remove that assumption from the code.\r\n\r\nSee\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22563\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27264#issuecomment-1481322628\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\n* Don't do prefixing on Tor, I2P and CJDNS and don't assume proximity based on that.\r\n* Treat all addresses from Tor as one group (because it is very easy to obtain huge amount of them). Same for I2P and CJDNS.\r\n* Make sure addrman can still store enough addresses from those networks.\r\n* Make sure a single source from Tor, I2P and CJDNS cannot flood addrman with junk due to the previous point.\r\n",
