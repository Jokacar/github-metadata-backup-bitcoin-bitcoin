With that in mind, what follows is a tentative timeline for us to switch from Gitian release builds to Guix ones for v22.0, subject to change.\r\n\r\n## Building + User Testing (~9 wks ending April 15th)\r\n### Outstanding PRs/Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] #20629 | depends: Improve id string robustness\r\n- [x] #21087 | guix: Passthrough BASE_CACHE into container \r\n- [x] #21088 | guix: Jump forwards in time-machine and adapt\r\n- [x] #21089 | guix: Add support for powerpc64{,le}\r\n- [x] #21203 | guix: gnutls-3.6.12 build failures when using `--bootstrap --no-substitutes`\r\n- [x] #21239 | guix: Add codesigning support for osx+win\r\n- [x] #21271 | guix: Explicitly set umask in build container\r\n- [x] #21272 | guix: Passthrough SDK_PATH into container\r\n- [x] #21273 | guix: Brainstorm w/re guix.sigs repo layout\r\n- [x] #21375 | guix: Misc feedback-based fixes + hier restructuring\r\n- [x] #21304 | guix: Add guix-clean script + establish gc-root for container profiles\r\n- [x] #21462 | guix: Add guix-{attest,verify} scripts\r\n\r\n### TODOs\r\n- Workflow-related\r\n\t- [x] Setting up a [`bitcoin-core/guix.sigs`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs) GitHub repository\r\n- Documentation-related\r\n\t- guix: Add installation instructions for Guix specific to Bitcoin Core builds\r\n\t*The GNU manual is too generic at times and somewhat difficult to navigate*\r\n\t- guix: Update all release documentation for new Guix process\r\n\t*`release-process.md` et al.*\r\n\r\n## Non-codesigned dress rehearsal (~2 wks ending April 29nd)\r\n\r\nAt this point, users should be able to follow `release-process.md` in order to perform Guix builds and attest to their outputs in `guix.sigs`.\r\n\r\nIn order to further improve the usability of this process, I will work with a few brave volunteers to walk through the core parts of `release-process.md`, namely:\r\n\r\n1. Installing Guix on their build machine\r\n2. Setting up a directory structure for Guix builds\r\n3. Performing a non-codesigned Guix build\r\n4. Uploading their SHA256SUMs and signatures to `guix.sigs`\r\n\r\nWhat to expect should you be brave enough to volunteer:\r\n\r\n1. I will open a direct line of communication where you can reach me for help\r\n2. I will document hiccups and open PRs to address common problems\r\n3. Depending on the performance characteristics of your build machine, whether or not you are using substitutes, and whether you request that Guix bootstraps, these builds can take up to a day or two.\r\n    I know it's fun to watch build logs scroll by 😄 , but we will most likely start the build on day `n` and check back on it on day `n+1`\r\n\r\nI would especially like to help volunteers who are not running Debian/Ubuntu, as diverse testing across distros/kernels is always a plus!\r\n\r\nPlease reach out to me if you are willing to volunteer for this.\r\n\r\n## Release dress rehearsal + refinement  (~2 wks ending May 13th)\r\n\r\nAfter we have performed user testing and ironed out usability kinks, I would like to do a dress rehearsal for the full release process.\r\n\r\nHere's how this differs from just \"user testing\":\r\n\r\n1. The commit we build will be tagged\r\n2. Codesignatures will be made and uploaded to `bitcoin-detached-sigs`\r\n3. SHA256SUMs and signatures of codesigned binaries will be uploaded to `guix.sigs`\r\n\r\nThis is to make sure that when we do the actual release for v22.0, there are no surprises.\r\n\r\n## Contingency buffer (~4+ wks ending June 15th)\r\nIf we run into any surprises (and I'm sure we will) this contingency buffer will give us some breathing room before the feature freeze.\r\n\r\n# What I need help with\r\n\r\n## High-priority\r\n\r\n- Review of outstanding PRs\r\n- Volunteers for user testing (Available sometime between March 19th and April 22nd)\r\n- Feedback on this timeline and remaining tasks outlined: am I missing anything? too optimistic?\r\n\r\n## Normal Priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Setting up a `bitcoin-core/guix.sigs` GitHub repository\r\n- [ ] Verifying that Guix debug symbol output works\r\n\r\n## Nice-to-have's\r\n\r\n- Packaging Guix v1.2.0 for your favourite distribution (please reach out if you do attempt this, I may be able to offer help!)\r\n- #21194 | guix: Make it arch agnostic\r\n",

[p2p: Erlay support signaling](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23443) — done\r\n2. [Follow-up](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26359) — done\r\n3. [p2p: Fill reconciliation sets and request reconciliation (Erlay)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26283) — pending\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nPlease use this discussion for high-level topics and keep the nitpics for the sub-PRs. The state of this branch might be not the cleanest and the freshest, although last time I rebased in on 2022/05/12 to be in sync {with master, with the latest child PR} and pass CI (modulo one race condition issue).\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation of  [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518) , using primitives in the BIP-330 (see the updated spec  [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki) ). Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670) .\r\n\r\nThis PR supersedes the previous [one](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261), because that one got too much review comments (I tried to resolve all of them for this version), and also it was much refactored since then.\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I’ll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n* save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n* increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n* improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\n### How to review\r\n\r\nI suggest doing `make clean && autogen.sh && configure` before you try building it locally.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nI created 2 discussion boards, please discuss not-code-related topics there:\r\n1. [Understanding bandwidth savings](https://github.com/naumenkogs/txrelaysim/issues/7)\r\n2. [Joining mainnet testing](https://github.com/naumenkogs/txrelaysim/issues/8)",

Maybe a little too much detail in some cases, i.e some things feel a bit repetitive, but I think that's ok for now.\r\n\r\nIn `release-process.md`, there are still two mentions of gitian in the `Update packaging repo` section.\r\n\r\nIn `guix-attest`, can you address [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22182#issuecomment-862869410) from #22182.\r\n\r\nI am running through doing a build using a Ubuntu:Hirsute container, using the following:\r\n```bash\r\ndocker run -it --rm --privileged ubuntu:hirsute /bin/bash\r\napt update -y && apt upgrade -y && apt install curl git guix make -y\r\n\r\naddgroup guixbuild\r\nuseradd -g guixbuild -G guixbuild -d /var/empty -s $(which nologin) -c \"Guix build user\" --system \"guixbuilder\"\r\nguix-daemon --no-substitutes --build-users-group=guixbuild &\r\n\r\ngit clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\r\ncd bitcoin\r\nHOSTS=\"x86_64-linux-gnu\" ./contrib/guix/guix-build\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also updated [my Alpine based dockerfile](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/blob/master/guix) to use Alpine 3.14, and am currently running through a from-scratch build using that.

Since the `check` phase happens after the\n+`build` phase, which may take quite a long time, it is recommended that users\n+either:\n+\n+1.

Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](), install it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+*A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with this simple routine:\n+\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+\n+autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` requires that a\n+debian-derived distribution has `zlib1g-dev` installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

This is largely equivalent to maually performing what the shell installer\n+script does.\n+\n+## Option 3: TODO fanquake docker\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian/Ubuntu\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) (\"bullseye\") and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix) (Hirsute Hippo).\n+\n+To install:\n+```sh\n+sudo apt install guix\n+```\n+\n+For up-to-date information on Debian and Ubuntu's release history:\n+- [Debian release history](https://www.debian.org/releases/)\n+- [Ubuntu release history](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)\n+\n+### Arch Linux\n+\n+Guix is available in the AUR as\n+[`guix`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/guix/), please follow the\n+installation instructions in the Arch Linux Wiki ([live\n+link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Guix#AUR_Package_Installation),\n+[2021/03/30\n+permalink](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Guix&oldid=637559#AUR_Package_Installation))\n+to install Guix.\n+\n+At the time of writing (2021/03/30), the `check` phase will fail if the path to\n+guix's build directory is longer than 36 characters due to an anachronistic\n+character limit on the shebang line. Since the `check` phase happens after the\n+`build` phase, which may take quite a long time, it is recommended that users\n+either:\n+\n+1. Skip the `check` phase\n+    - For `makepkg`: `makepkg --nocheck ...`\n+    - For `yay`: `yay --mflags=\"--nocheck\" ...`\n+    - For `paru`: `paru --nocheck ...`\n+2. Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](), install it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+*A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with this simple routine:\n+\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+\n+autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` requires that a\n+debian-derived distribution has `zlib1g-dev` installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

More information on standard Automake directory variables\n+can be found\n+[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Standard-Directory-Variables.html).\n+\n+However, the Guix init scripts and service configurations for Upstart, systemd,\n+SysV, and OpenRC are installed to launch\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon`,\n+which does not yet exist, and will only exist after `root` performs their first\n+`guix pull`.\n+\n+We need to create a `-original` version of these init scripts that's pointed to\n+binaries in `${bindir}` (normally, `/usr/local/bin`).\n+\n+Example for `systemd`, run as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+# Create guix-daemon-original.service by modifying guix-daemon.service\n+bindir=\"$(dirname $(command -v guix-daemon))\"\n+sed -E -e \"s|/\\S*/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon|${bindir}/guix-daemon|\" /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon.service > /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+\n+# Make systemd recognize the new service\n+systemctl daemon-reload\n+\n+# Make sure that the non-working guix-daemon.service is stopped and disabled\n+systemctl stop guix-daemon\n+systemctl disable guix-daemon\n+\n+# Make sure that the working guix-daemon-original.service is started and enabled\n+systemctl enable guix-daemon-original\n+systemctl start guix-daemon-original\n+```\n+\n+###### Create guix-daemon users / groups\n+\n+Please see the [relevant\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Build-Environment-Setup.html)\n+in the Guix Reference Manual for more details.\n+\n+## Optional setup\n+\n+At this point, you are set up to [use Guix to build bitcoin](). However, if you\n+want to polish your setup a bit and make it \"what Guix intended\", then read the\n+next few subsections.\n+\n+### Add an `/etc/profile.d` entry\n+\n+Although Guix knows how to update itself and its packages, it does so in a\n+non-invasive way (it does not modify `/usr/local/bin/guix`).\n+\n+Instead, it does the following:\n+\n+- After a `guix pull`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/current-guix`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.config/guix/current`\n+\n+- After a `guix install`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/guix-profile`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.guix-profile`\n+\n+Therefore, in order for these operations to effect your shell/desktop sessions\n+(and for the principle of least astonishment to hold), their corresponding\n+directories have to be added to well-known environment variables like `$PATH`,\n+`$INFOPATH`, `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, etc.\n+\n+In other words, if `$HOME/.config/guix/current/bin` does not exist in your\n+`$PATH`, a `guix pull` will have no effect on what `guix` you are using. Same\n+goes for `$HOME/.guix-profile/bin`, `guix install`, and installed packages.\n+\n+Helpfully, after a `guix pull` or `guix install`, a message will be printed like\n+so:\n+\n+```\n+hint: Consider setting the necessary environment variables by running:\n+\n+     GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+     . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+Alternately, see `guix package --search-paths -p \"$HOME/.guix-profile\"'.\n+```\n+\n+However, this is somewhat tedious to do for both `guix pull` and `guix install`\n+for each user on the system that wants to properly use `guix`.

This is done by default\n+when installing the Debian package later than 1.2.0-4 and when using the shell\n+script installer.\n+\n+Create `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` with the following content:\n+```sh\n+# _GUIX_PROFILE: `guix pull` profile\n+_GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.config/guix/current\"\n+if [ -L $_GUIX_PROFILE ]; then\n+  export PATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/bin${PATH:+:}$PATH\"\n+  # Export INFOPATH so that the updated info pages can be found\n+  # and read by both /usr/bin/info and/or $GUIX_PROFILE/bin/info\n+  # When INFOPATH is unset, add a trailing colon so that Emacs\n+  # searches 'Info-default-directory-list'.\n+  export INFOPATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/share/info:$INFOPATH\"\n+fi\n+\n+# GUIX_PROFILE: User's default profile\n+GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+[ -L $GUIX_PROFILE ] || return\n+GUIX_LOCPATH=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/lib/locale\"\n+export GUIX_PROFILE GUIX_LOCPATH\n+\n+[ -f \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\" ] && . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+# set XDG_DATA_DIRS to include Guix installations\n+export XDG_DATA_DIRS=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS:-/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/}\"\n+```\n+\n+Please note that this will not take effect until the next shell or desktop\n+session (log out and log back in).\n+\n+### `guix pull` as root\n+\n+Before you do this, you need to read [choose your security model]() and adjust\n+`guix` and `guix-daemon` flags according to your choice, as invoking `guix pull`\n+may pull substitutes from substitute servers (which you may not want).\n+\n+As mentioned in a previous section, Guix expects\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix` to be populated with\n+`root`'s Guix profile, `guix pull`-ed and built by some former version of Guix.\n+However, this is not the case when we build from source.

In particular, the official shell installer\n+script asks you if you want the key installed, and the debian distribution\n+package authorized the key during installation.\n+\n+You can check the current list of authorized keys at `/etc/guix/acl`.\n+\n+At the time of writing, a `/etc/guix/acl` with just the Guix build farm key\n+authorized looks something like:\n+```lisp\n+(acl\n+ (entry\n+  (public-key\n+   (ecc\n+    (curve Ed25519)\n+    (q #8D156F295D24B0D9A86FA5741A840FF2D24F60F7B6C4134814AD55625971B394#)\n+    )\n+   )\n+  (tag\n+   (guix import)\n+   )\n+  )\n+ )\n+```\n \n-After installation, you may want to consider [adding substitute\n-servers](#speeding-up-builds-with-substitute-servers) from which to download\n-pre-built packages to speed up your build if that fits your security model (say,\n-if you're just testing that this works). Substitute servers are set up by\n-default if you're using the [Dockerfile][fanquake/guix-docker].\n+If you've determined that the official Guix build farm key hasn't been\n+authorized, and you would like to authorize it, run the following as root:\n+\n+```\n+guix archive --authorize < /var/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/share/guix/ci.guix.gnu.org.pub\n+```\n+\n+If\n+`/var/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/share/guix/ci.guix.gnu.org.pub`\n+doesn't exist, try:\n+\n+```sh\n+guix archive --authorize < <PREFIX>/share/guix/ci.guix.gnu.org.pub\n+```\n+\n+Where <PREFIX> is likely:\n+- `/usr` if you installed from a distribution package\n+- `/usr/local` if you installed Guix from source and didn't supply any\n+  prefix-modifying flags to Guix's `./configure`\n+\n+For dongcarl's substitute server at https://guix.carldong.io, run as root:\n+\n+```sh\n+wget -qO- 'https://guix.carldong.io/signing-key.pub' | guix archive --authorize\n+```\n+\n+### Step 2: Specify the substitute servers\n+\n+Once its key is authorized, the official Guix build farm at\n+https://ci.guix.gnu.org is automatically used unless the `--no-substitutes` flag\n+is supplied. This behaviour is overridable. See examples below for the various\n+ways of adding dongcarl's substitute server after having [authorized his signing\n+key](#authorize-the-signing-keys).\n+\n+Change the default list of substitute servers by starting `guix-daemon` with the\n+`--substitute-urls` option:\n+```\n+guix <cmd> --substitute-urls=\"https://guix.carldong.io https://ci.guix.gnu.org\"",

Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](), install it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+*A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with this simple routine:\n+\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+\n+autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` requires that a\n+debian-derived distribution has `zlib1g-dev` installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations. See\n+the last paragraph of this\n+[section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) for more\n+details.\n+\n+Build Guix (this will take a while):\n+```\n+make -j$(nproc)\n+```\n+\n+Install Guix:\n+\n+```\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+##### Setting Up the Daemon\n+\n+###### Fixing `argv[0]`\n+\n+At this point, guix will be installed to `${bindir}`, which is likely\n+`/usr/local/bin` if you did not override directory variables at\n+`./configure`-time. More information on standard Automake directory variables\n+can be found\n+[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Standard-Directory-Variables.html).\n+\n+However, the Guix init scripts and service configurations for Upstart, systemd,\n+SysV, and OpenRC are installed to launch\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon`,\n+which does not yet exist, and will only exist after `root` performs their first\n+`guix pull`.\n+\n+We need to create a `-original` version of these init scripts that's pointed to\n+binaries in `${bindir}` (normally, `/usr/local/bin`).\n+\n+Example for `systemd`, run as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+# Create guix-daemon-original.service by modifying guix-daemon.service\n+bindir=\"$(dirname $(command -v guix-daemon))\"\n+sed -E -e \"s|/\\S*/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon|${bindir}/guix-daemon|\" /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon.service > /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+\n+# Make systemd recognize the new service\n+systemctl daemon-reload\n+\n+# Make sure that the non-working guix-daemon.service is stopped and disabled\n+systemctl stop guix-daemon\n+systemctl disable guix-daemon\n+\n+# Make sure that the working guix-daemon-original.service is started and enabled\n+systemctl enable guix-daemon-original\n+systemctl start guix-daemon-original\n+```\n+\n+###### Create guix-daemon users / groups\n+\n+Please see the [relevant\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Build-Environment-Setup.html)\n+in the Guix Reference Manual for more details.\n+\n+## Optional setup\n+\n+At this point, you are set up to [use Guix to build bitcoin](). However, if you\n+want to polish your setup a bit and make it \"what Guix intended\", then read the\n+next few subsections.\n+\n+### Add an `/etc/profile.d` entry\n+\n+Although Guix knows how to update itself and its packages, it does so in a\n+non-invasive way (it does not modify `/usr/local/bin/guix`).\n+\n+Instead, it does the following:\n+\n+- After a `guix pull`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/current-guix`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.config/guix/current`\n+\n+- After a `guix install`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/guix-profile`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.guix-profile`\n+\n+Therefore, in order for these operations to effect your shell/desktop sessions\n+(and for the principle of least astonishment to hold), their corresponding\n+directories have to be added to well-known environment variables like `$PATH`,\n+`$INFOPATH`, `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, etc.\n+\n+In other words, if `$HOME/.config/guix/current/bin` does not exist in your\n+`$PATH`, a `guix pull` will have no effect on what `guix` you are using. Same\n+goes for `$HOME/.guix-profile/bin`, `guix install`, and installed packages.\n+\n+Helpfully, after a `guix pull` or `guix install`, a message will be printed like\n+so:\n+\n+```\n+hint: Consider setting the necessary environment variables by running:\n+\n+     GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+     . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+Alternately, see `guix package --search-paths -p \"$HOME/.guix-profile\"'.\n+```\n+\n+However, this is somewhat tedious to do for both `guix pull` and `guix install`\n+for each user on the system that wants to properly use `guix`. I recommend that\n+you instead add an entry to `/etc/profile.d` instead. This is done by default\n+when installing the Debian package later than 1.2.0-4 and when using the shell\n+script installer.\n+\n+Create `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` with the following content:\n+```sh\n+# _GUIX_PROFILE: `guix pull` profile\n+_GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.config/guix/current\"\n+if [ -L $_GUIX_PROFILE ]; then\n+  export PATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/bin${PATH:+:}$PATH\"\n+  # Export INFOPATH so that the updated info pages can be found\n+  # and read by both /usr/bin/info and/or $GUIX_PROFILE/bin/info\n+  # When INFOPATH is unset, add a trailing colon so that Emacs\n+  # searches 'Info-default-directory-list'.\n+  export INFOPATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/share/info:$INFOPATH\"\n+fi\n+\n+# GUIX_PROFILE: User's default profile\n+GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+[ -L $GUIX_PROFILE ] || return\n+GUIX_LOCPATH=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/lib/locale\"\n+export GUIX_PROFILE GUIX_LOCPATH\n+\n+[ -f \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\" ] && . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+# set XDG_DATA_DIRS to include Guix installations\n+export XDG_DATA_DIRS=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS:-/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/}\"\n+```\n+\n+Please note that this will not take effect until the next shell or desktop\n+session (log out and log back in).\n+\n+### `guix pull` as root\n+\n+Before you do this, you need to read [choose your security model]() and adjust\n+`guix` and `guix-daemon` flags according to your choice, as invoking `guix pull`\n+may pull substitutes from substitute servers (which you may not want).\n+\n+As mentioned in a previous section, Guix expects\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix` to be populated with\n+`root`'s Guix profile, `guix pull`-ed and built by some former version of Guix.\n+However, this is not the case when we build from source. Therefore, we need to\n+perform a `guix pull` as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+sudo --login guix pull --branch=version-<latest-release-version>\n+# or\n+sudo --login guix pull --commit=<particular-commit>\n+```\n+\n+`guix pull` is quite a long process (espcially if you're using",

Since the `check` phase happens after the\n+`build` phase, which may take quite a long time, it is recommended that users\n+either:\n+\n+1.

Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](), install it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+*A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with this simple routine:\n+\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+\n+autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` requires that a\n+debian-derived distribution has `zlib1g-dev` installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations. See\n+the last paragraph of this\n+[section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) for more\n+details.\n+\n+Build Guix (this will take a while):\n+```\n+make -j$(nproc)\n+```\n+\n+Install Guix:\n+\n+```\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+##### Setting Up the Daemon\n+\n+###### Fixing `argv[0]`\n+\n+At this point, guix will be installed to `${bindir}`, which is likely\n+`/usr/local/bin` if you did not override directory variables at\n+`./configure`-time. More information on standard Automake directory variables\n+can be found\n+[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Standard-Directory-Variables.html).\n+\n+However, the Guix init scripts and service configurations for Upstart, systemd,\n+SysV, and OpenRC are installed to launch\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon`,\n+which does not yet exist, and will only exist after `root` performs their first\n+`guix pull`.\n+\n+We need to create a `-original` version of these init scripts that's pointed to\n+binaries in `${bindir}` (normally, `/usr/local/bin`).\n+\n+Example for `systemd`, run as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+# Create guix-daemon-original.service by modifying guix-daemon.service\n+bindir=\"$(dirname $(command -v guix-daemon))\"\n+sed -E -e \"s|/\\S*/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon|${bindir}/guix-daemon|\" /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon.service > /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+\n+# Make systemd recognize the new service\n+systemctl daemon-reload\n+\n+# Make sure that the non-working guix-daemon.service is stopped and disabled\n+systemctl stop guix-daemon\n+systemctl disable guix-daemon\n+\n+# Make sure that the working guix-daemon-original.service is started and enabled\n+systemctl enable guix-daemon-original\n+systemctl start guix-daemon-original\n+```\n+\n+###### Create guix-daemon users / groups\n+\n+Please see the [relevant\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Build-Environment-Setup.html)\n+in the Guix Reference Manual for more details.\n+\n+## Optional setup\n+\n+At this point, you are set up to [use Guix to build bitcoin](). However, if you\n+want to polish your setup a bit and make it \"what Guix intended\", then read the\n+next few subsections.\n+\n+### Add an `/etc/profile.d` entry\n+\n+Although Guix knows how to update itself and its packages, it does so in a\n+non-invasive way (it does not modify `/usr/local/bin/guix`).\n+\n+Instead, it does the following:\n+\n+- After a `guix pull`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/current-guix`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.config/guix/current`\n+\n+- After a `guix install`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/guix-profile`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.guix-profile`\n+\n+Therefore, in order for these operations to effect your shell/desktop sessions\n+(and for the principle of least astonishment to hold), their corresponding\n+directories have to be added to well-known environment variables like `$PATH`,\n+`$INFOPATH`, `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, etc.\n+\n+In other words, if `$HOME/.config/guix/current/bin` does not exist in your\n+`$PATH`, a `guix pull` will have no effect on what `guix` you are using. Same\n+goes for `$HOME/.guix-profile/bin`, `guix install`, and installed packages.\n+\n+Helpfully, after a `guix pull` or `guix install`, a message will be printed like\n+so:\n+\n+```\n+hint: Consider setting the necessary environment variables by running:\n+\n+     GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+     . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+Alternately, see `guix package --search-paths -p \"$HOME/.guix-profile\"'.\n+```\n+\n+However, this is somewhat tedious to do for both `guix pull` and `guix install`\n+for each user on the system that wants to properly use `guix`. I recommend that\n+you instead add an entry to `/etc/profile.d` instead. This is done by default\n+when installing the Debian package later than 1.2.0-4 and when using the shell\n+script installer.\n+\n+Create `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` with the following content:\n+```sh\n+# _GUIX_PROFILE: `guix pull` profile\n+_GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.config/guix/current\"\n+if [ -L $_GUIX_PROFILE ]; then\n+  export PATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/bin${PATH:+:}$PATH\"\n+  # Export INFOPATH so that the updated info pages can be found\n+  # and read by both /usr/bin/info and/or $GUIX_PROFILE/bin/info\n+  # When INFOPATH is unset, add a trailing colon so that Emacs\n+  # searches 'Info-default-directory-list'.\n+  export INFOPATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/share/info:$INFOPATH\"\n+fi\n+\n+# GUIX_PROFILE: User's default profile\n+GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+[ -L $GUIX_PROFILE ] || return\n+GUIX_LOCPATH=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/lib/locale\"\n+export GUIX_PROFILE GUIX_LOCPATH\n+\n+[ -f \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\" ] && . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+# set XDG_DATA_DIRS to include Guix installations\n+export XDG_DATA_DIRS=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS:-/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/}\"\n+```\n+\n+Please note that this will not take effect until the next shell or desktop\n+session (log out and log back in).\n+\n+### `guix pull` as root\n+\n+Before you do this, you need to read [choose your security model]() and adjust\n+`guix` and `guix-daemon` flags according to your choice, as invoking `guix pull`\n+may pull substitutes from substitute servers (which you may not want).\n+\n+As mentioned in a previous section, Guix expects\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix` to be populated with\n+`root`'s Guix profile, `guix pull`-ed and built by some former version of Guix.\n+However, this is not the case when we build from source. Therefore, we need to\n+perform a `guix pull` as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+sudo --login guix pull --branch=version-<latest-release-version>\n+# or\n+sudo --login guix pull --commit=<particular-commit>\n+```\n+\n+`guix pull` is quite a long process (espcially if you're using\n+`--no-substitute`). If you encounter build problems, please refer to the\n+[troubleshooting section]().\n+\n+Note that running a bare `guix pull` with no commit or branch specified will\n+pull the latest commit on Guix's master branch, which is likely fine, but not\n+recommended.\n+\n+If you installed Guix from source, you may get an error like the following:\n+```sh\n+error: while creating symlink '/root/.config/guix/current' No such file or directory\n+```\n+To resolve this, simply:\n+```\n+sudo mkdir -p /root/.config/guix\n+```\n+Then try the `guix pull` command again.\n+\n+After the `guix pull` finishes successfully,\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix` should be populated.\n+\n+### Restarting the daemon\n+\n+If you built Guix from source and followed the instructions for [fixing argv\\[0\\]](), you can\n+now do the following:\n+\n+```sh\n+systemctl stop guix-daemon-original\n+systemctl disable guix-daemon-original\n+\n+systemctl enable guix-daemon\n+systemctl start guix-daemon\n+```\n+\n+Otherwise, simply do:\n \n-### Installing Guix\n+```sh\n+systemctl restart guix-daemon\n+```\n+\n+### Checking everything\n+\n+If you followed all the steps above to make your Guix setup \"prim and proper,\"\n+you can check that you did everything properly by running through this\n+checklist.\n+\n+1. `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` should exist and be sourced at each shell login\n \n-If you're just testing this out, you can use the\n-[Dockerfile][fanquake/guix-docker] for convenience.

In particular, the official shell installer\n+script asks you if you want the key installed, and the debian distribution\n+package authorized the key during installation.\n+\n+You can check the current list of authorized keys at `/etc/guix/acl`.\n+\n+At the time of writing, a `/etc/guix/acl` with just the Guix build farm key\n+authorized looks something like:\n+```lisp\n+(acl\n+ (entry\n+  (public-key\n+   (ecc\n+    (curve Ed25519)\n+    (q #8D156F295D24B0D9A86FA5741A840FF2D24F60F7B6C4134814AD55625971B394#)\n+    )\n+   )\n+  (tag\n+   (guix import)\n+   )\n+  )\n+ )\n+```\n \n-After installation, you may want to consider [adding substitute\n-servers](#speeding-up-builds-with-substitute-servers) from which to download\n-pre-built packages to speed up your build if that fits your security model (say,\n-if you're just testing that this works). Substitute servers are set up by\n-default if you're using the [Dockerfile][fanquake/guix-docker].\n+If you've determined that the official Guix build farm key hasn't been\n+authorized, and you would like to authorize it, run the following as root:\n+\n+```\n+guix archive --authorize < /var/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/share/guix/ci.guix.gnu.org.pub\n+```\n+\n+If\n+`/var/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/share/guix/ci.guix.gnu.org.pub`\n+doesn't exist, try:\n+\n+```sh\n+guix archive --authorize < <PREFIX>/share/guix/ci.guix.gnu.org.pub\n+```\n+\n+Where <PREFIX> is likely:\n+- `/usr` if you installed from a distribution package\n+- `/usr/local` if you installed Guix from source and didn't supply any\n+  prefix-modifying flags to Guix's `./configure`\n+\n+For dongcarl's substitute server at https://guix.carldong.io, run as root:\n+\n+```sh\n+wget -qO- 'https://guix.carldong.io/signing-key.pub' | guix archive --authorize\n+```\n+\n+### Step 2: Specify the substitute servers\n+\n+Once its key is authorized, the official Guix build farm at\n+https://ci.guix.gnu.org is automatically used unless the `--no-substitutes` flag\n+is supplied.

Using a **distribution-maintained package** [⤓ skip to section]()\n+   - Maintained by distribution's Guix package maintainer\n+   - Normal difficulty (manual setup required)\n+   - Works only on distributions with Guix packaged, at time of writing:\n+     - Debian Bullseye or later\n+     - Ubuntu Hirsute or later\n+     - Arch Linux (via AUR)\n+   - Installs a release decided on by package maintainer\n+   - Source or binary installation depending on distribution\n+5. Building **from source** [⤓ skip to section]()\n+   - Maintained by you\n+   - Hard, but rewarding\n+   - Can be made to work on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any commit (more granular)\n+   - Source installation, requires lower level of trust\n+\n+## Options 1 and 2: Using the official shell installer script or binary tarball\n+\n+The instructions for both using the offical shell installer script and using\n+binary tarballs are both found in the GNU Guix Manual's [Binary Installation\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html).\n+\n+Note that running through the binary tarball installation steps is largely\n+equivalent to manually performing what the shell installer script does.\n+\n+Note that at the time of writing (July 5th, 2021), the shell installer script\n+automatically creates an `/etc/profile.d` entry which the binary tarball\n+installation instructions do not ask you to create. However, you will likely\n+need this entry for better desktop integration. Please see [this section]() for\n+instructions on how to add a `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian 11 (\"Bullseye\")/Ubuntu 21.04 (\"Hirsute\")\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) (\"bullseye\") and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix) (Hirsute Hippo).",

Please see [this\n+section](#add-an-etcprofiled-entry) for instructions on how to add a\n+`/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian 11 (Bullseye)/Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix).\n+\n+Note that if you intend on using Guix without using any substitutes (more\n+details [here][security-model]), v1.2.0 has a known problems when building\n+GnuTLS from source.

Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+I strongly urge you to at least skim through the entire section once before you\n+start issuing commands, as it will save you a lot of unncessary pain and\n+anguish.\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](guix-v1.3.0-bootstrap.png)\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+***IMPORTANT**: A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with the following:\n+\n+Clone the repository and check out the latest release:\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+For autoconf-based build systems (if `./autogen.sh` or `configure.ac` exists at\n+the root of the repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+./autogen.sh || autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+For CMake-based build systems (if `CMakeLists.txt` exists at the root of the\n+repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+mkdir build && cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>\n+sudo cmake --build . --target install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` on Debian-derived\n+distributions requires that `zlib1g-dev` is installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+I strongly urge you to at least skim through the entire section once before you\n+start issuing commands, as it will save you a lot of unncessary pain and\n+anguish.\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](guix-v1.3.0-bootstrap.png)\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+***IMPORTANT**: A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with the following:\n+\n+Clone the repository and check out the latest release:\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+For autoconf-based build systems (if `./autogen.sh` or `configure.ac` exists at\n+the root of the repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+./autogen.sh || autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+For CMake-based build systems (if `CMakeLists.txt` exists at the root of the\n+repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+mkdir build && cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>\n+sudo cmake --build . --target install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` on Debian-derived\n+distributions requires that `zlib1g-dev` is installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+***IMPORTANT**: A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with the following:\n+\n+Clone the repository and check out the latest release:\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+For autoconf-based build systems (if `./autogen.sh` or `configure.ac` exists at\n+the root of the repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+./autogen.sh || autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+For CMake-based build systems (if `CMakeLists.txt` exists at the root of the\n+repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+mkdir build && cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>\n+sudo cmake --build . --target install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` on Debian-derived\n+distributions requires that `zlib1g-dev` is installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations. See\n+the last paragraph of this\n+[section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) for more\n+details.\n+\n+Build Guix (this will take a while):\n+```\n+make -j$(nproc)\n+```\n+\n+Install Guix:\n+\n+```\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+### Post-\"build from source\" Setup\n+\n+#### Creating and starting a `guix-daemon-original` service with a fixed `argv[0]`\n+\n+At this point, guix will be installed to `${bindir}`, which is likely\n+`/usr/local/bin` if you did not override directory variables at\n+`./configure`-time. More information on standard Automake directory variables\n+can be found\n+[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Standard-Directory-Variables.html).\n+\n+However, the Guix init scripts and service configurations for Upstart, systemd,\n+SysV, and OpenRC are installed to launch\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon`,\n+which does not yet exist, and will only exist after `root` performs their first\n+`guix pull`. TODO: Link to `guix pull` as root section\n+\n+We need to create a `-original` version of these init scripts that's pointed to\n+the binaries we just built and `make install`'ed in `${bindir}` (normally,\n+`/usr/local/bin`).\n+\n+Example for `systemd`, run as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+# Create guix-daemon-original.service by modifying guix-daemon.service\n+bindir=\"$(dirname $(command -v guix-daemon))\"\n+sed -E -e \"s|/\\S*/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon|${bindir}/guix-daemon|\" /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon.service > /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+\n+# Make systemd recognize the new service\n+systemctl daemon-reload\n+\n+# Make sure that the non-working guix-daemon.service is stopped and disabled\n+systemctl stop guix-daemon\n+systemctl disable guix-daemon\n+\n+# Make sure that the working guix-daemon-original.service is started and enabled\n+systemctl enable guix-daemon-original\n+systemctl start guix-daemon-original\n+```\n+\n+#### Creating `guix-daemon` users / groups\n+\n+Please see the [relevant\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Build-Environment-Setup.html)\n+in the Guix Reference Manual for more details.\n+\n+## Optional setup\n+\n+At this point, you are set up to [use Guix to build bitcoin](./README.md#usage).\n+However, if you want to polish your setup a bit and make it \"what Guix\n+intended\", then read the next few subsections.\n+\n+### Add an `/etc/profile.d` entry\n+\n+This section definitely does not apply to you if you installed Guix using:\n+1. The shell installer script\n+2. fanquake's Docker image\n+3. Debian's `guix` package\n+\n+#### Background\n+\n+Although Guix knows how to update itself and its packages, it does so in a\n+non-invasive way (it does not modify `/usr/local/bin/guix`).\n+\n+Instead, it does the following:\n+\n+- After a `guix pull`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/current-guix`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.config/guix/current`\n+\n+- After a `guix install`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/guix-profile`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.guix-profile`\n+\n+Therefore, in order for these operations to affect your shell/desktop sessions\n+(and for the principle of least astonishment to hold), their corresponding\n+directories have to be added to well-known environment variables like `$PATH`,\n+`$INFOPATH`, `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, etc.\n+\n+In other words, if `$HOME/.config/guix/current/bin` does not exist in your\n+`$PATH`, a `guix pull` will have no effect on what `guix` you are using. Same\n+goes for `$HOME/.guix-profile/bin`, `guix install`, and installed packages.\n+\n+Helpfully, after a `guix pull` or `guix install`, a message will be printed like\n+so:\n+\n+```\n+hint: Consider setting the necessary environment variables by running:\n+\n+     GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+     . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+Alternately, see `guix package --search-paths -p \"$HOME/.guix-profile\"'.\n+```\n+\n+However, this is somewhat tedious to do for both `guix pull` and `guix install`\n+for each user on the system that wants to properly use `guix`. I recommend that\n+you instead add an entry to `/etc/profile.d` instead. This is done by default\n+when installing the Debian package later than 1.2.0-4 and when using the shell\n+script installer.\n+\n+#### Instructions\n+\n+Create `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` with the following content:\n+```sh\n+# _GUIX_PROFILE: `guix pull` profile\n+_GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.config/guix/current\"\n+if [ -L $_GUIX_PROFILE ]; then\n+  export PATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/bin${PATH:+:}$PATH\"\n+  # Export INFOPATH so that the updated info pages can be found\n+  # and read by both /usr/bin/info and/or $GUIX_PROFILE/bin/info\n+  # When INFOPATH is unset, add a trailing colon so that Emacs\n+  # searches 'Info-default-directory-list'.\n+  export INFOPATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/share/info:$INFOPATH\"\n+fi\n+\n+# GUIX_PROFILE: User's default profile\n+GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+[ -L $GUIX_PROFILE ] || return\n+GUIX_LOCPATH=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/lib/locale\"\n+export GUIX_PROFILE GUIX_LOCPATH\n+\n+[ -f \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\" ] && . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+# set XDG_DATA_DIRS to include Guix installations\n+export XDG_DATA_DIRS=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS:-/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/}\"\n+```\n+\n+Please note that this will not take effect until the next shell or desktop\n+session (log out and log back in).\n+\n+### `guix pull` as root\n+\n+Before you do this, you need to read the section on [choosing your security\n+model][security-model] and adjust `guix` and `guix-daemon` flags according to\n+your choice, as invoking `guix pull` may pull substitutes from substitute\n+servers (which you may not want).\n+\n+As mentioned in a previous section, Guix expects\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix` to be populated with\n+`root`'s Guix profile, `guix pull`-ed and built by some former version of Guix.\n+However, this is not the case when we build from source. Therefore, we need to\n+perform a `guix pull` as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+sudo --login guix pull --branch=version-<latest-release-version>\n+# or\n+sudo --login guix pull --commit=<particular-commit>\n+```\n+\n+`guix pull` is quite a long process (especially if you're using",

Skip the `check` phase\n+    - For `makepkg`: `makepkg --nocheck ...`\n+    - For `yay`: `yay --mflags=\"--nocheck\" ...`\n+    - For `paru`: `paru --nocheck ...`\n+2. Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+I strongly urge you to at least skim through the entire section once before you\n+start issuing commands, as it will save you a lot of unncessary pain and\n+anguish.\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](guix-v1.3.0-bootstrap.png)\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+***IMPORTANT**: A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with the following:\n+\n+Clone the repository and check out the latest release:\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+For autoconf-based build systems (if `./autogen.sh` or `configure.ac` exists at\n+the root of the repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+./autogen.sh || autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+For CMake-based build systems (if `CMakeLists.txt` exists at the root of the\n+repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+mkdir build && cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>\n+sudo cmake --build . --target install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` on Debian-derived\n+distributions requires that `zlib1g-dev` is installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

If you have already completed the\n+installation and setup, please proceed to [perform a build](./README.md).\n+\n+Otherwise, you may choose from one of the following options to install Guix:\n+\n+1. Using the official **shell installer script** [⤓ skip to section][install-script]\n+   - Maintained by Guix developers\n+   - Easiest (automatically performs *most* setup)\n+   - Works on nearly all Linux distributions\n+   - Only installs latest release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+   - Note: The script needs to be run as root, so it should be inspected before it's run\n+2. Using the official **binary tarball** [⤓ skip to section][install-bin-tarball]\n+   - Maintained by Guix developers\n+   - Normal difficulty (full manual setup required)\n+   - Works on nearly all Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+3. Using fanquake's **Docker image** [↗︎ external instructions][install-fanquake-docker]\n+   - Maintained by fanquake\n+   - Easy (automatically performs *some* setup)\n+   - Works on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any release\n+   - Binary installation only, requires high level of trust\n+4. Using a **distribution-maintained package** [⤓ skip to section][install-distro-pkg]\n+   - Maintained by distribution's Guix package maintainer\n+   - Normal difficulty (manual setup required)\n+   - Works only on distributions with Guix packaged, at time of writing:\n+     - Debian Bullseye or later\n+     - Ubuntu Hirsute or later\n+     - Arch Linux (via AUR)\n+   - Installs a release decided on by package maintainer\n+   - Source or binary installation depending on the distribution\n+5. Building **from source** [⤓ skip to section][install-source]\n+   - Maintained by you\n+   - Hard, but rewarding\n+   - Can be made to work on most Linux distributions\n+   - Installs any commit (more granular)\n+   - Source installation, requires lower level of trust\n+\n+## Options 1 and 2: Using the official shell installer script or binary tarball\n+\n+The installation instructions for both using the offical shell installer script\n+and using binary tarballs can be found in the GNU Guix Manual's [Binary\n+Installation\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html).\n+\n+Note that running through the binary tarball installation steps is largely\n+equivalent to manually performing what the shell installer script does.\n+\n+Note that at the time of writing (July 5th, 2021), the shell installer script\n+automatically creates an `/etc/profile.d` entry which the binary tarball\n+installation instructions do not ask you to create. However, you will likely\n+need this entry for better desktop integration. Please see [this\n+section](#add-an-etcprofiled-entry) for instructions on how to add a\n+`/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian 11 (Bullseye)/Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix).\n+\n+Note that if you intend on using Guix without using any substitutes (more\n+details [here][security-model]), v1.2.0 has a known problems when building\n+GnuTLS from source. Solutions and workarounds are documented\n+[here](#gnutls-test-suite-fail-status-request-revoked).\n+\n+\n+To install:\n+```sh\n+sudo apt install guix\n+```\n+\n+For up-to-date information on Debian and Ubuntu's release history:\n+- [Debian release history](https://www.debian.org/releases/)\n+- [Ubuntu release history](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)\n+\n+### Arch Linux\n+\n+Guix is available in the AUR as\n+[`guix`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/guix/), please follow the\n+installation instructions in the Arch Linux Wiki ([live\n+link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Guix#AUR_Package_Installation),\n+[2021/03/30\n+permalink](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Guix&oldid=637559#AUR_Package_Installation))\n+to install Guix.\n+\n+At the time of writing (2021/03/30), the `check` phase will fail if the path to\n+guix's build directory is longer than 36 characters due to an anachronistic\n+character limit on the shebang line. Since the `check` phase happens after the\n+`build` phase, which may take quite a long time, it is recommended that users\n+either:\n+\n+1. Skip the `check` phase\n+    - For `makepkg`: `makepkg --nocheck ...`\n+    - For `yay`: `yay --mflags=\"--nocheck\" ...`\n+    - For `paru`: `paru --nocheck ...`\n+2. Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+I strongly urge you to at least skim through the entire section once before you\n+start issuing commands, as it will save you a lot of unncessary pain and\n+anguish.\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](guix-v1.3.0-bootstrap.png)\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+***IMPORTANT**: A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with the following:\n+\n+Clone the repository and check out the latest release:\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+For autoconf-based build systems (if `./autogen.sh` or `configure.ac` exists at\n+the root of the repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+./autogen.sh || autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+For CMake-based build systems (if `CMakeLists.txt` exists at the root of the\n+repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+mkdir build && cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>\n+sudo cmake --build . --target install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` on Debian-derived\n+distributions requires that `zlib1g-dev` is installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

Please see [this\n+section](#add-an-etcprofiled-entry) for instructions on how to add a\n+`/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian 11 (Bullseye)/Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix).\n+\n+Note that if you intend on using Guix without using any substitutes (more\n+details [here][security-model]), v1.2.0 has a known problems when building\n+GnuTLS from source. Solutions and workarounds are documented\n+[here](#gnutls-test-suite-fail-status-request-revoked).\n+\n+\n+To install:\n+```sh\n+sudo apt install guix\n+```\n+\n+For up-to-date information on Debian and Ubuntu's release history:\n+- [Debian release history](https://www.debian.org/releases/)\n+- [Ubuntu release history](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)\n+\n+### Arch Linux\n+\n+Guix is available in the AUR as\n+[`guix`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/guix/), please follow the\n+installation instructions in the Arch Linux Wiki ([live\n+link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Guix#AUR_Package_Installation),\n+[2021/03/30\n+permalink](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Guix&oldid=637559#AUR_Package_Installation))\n+to install Guix.\n+\n+At the time of writing (2021/03/30), the `check` phase will fail if the path to\n+guix's build directory is longer than 36 characters due to an anachronistic\n+character limit on the shebang line. Since the `check` phase happens after the\n+`build` phase, which may take quite a long time, it is recommended that users\n+either:\n+\n+1. Skip the `check` phase\n+    - For `makepkg`: `makepkg --nocheck ...`\n+    - For `yay`: `yay --mflags=\"--nocheck\" ...`\n+    - For `paru`: `paru --nocheck ...`\n+2. Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+I strongly urge you to at least skim through the entire section once before you\n+start issuing commands, as it will save you a lot of unncessary pain and\n+anguish.\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](guix-v1.3.0-bootstrap.png)\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+***IMPORTANT**: A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with the following:\n+\n+Clone the repository and check out the latest release:\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+For autoconf-based build systems (if `./autogen.sh` or `configure.ac` exists at\n+the root of the repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+./autogen.sh || autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+For CMake-based build systems (if `CMakeLists.txt` exists at the root of the\n+repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+mkdir build && cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>\n+sudo cmake --build . --target install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` on Debian-derived\n+distributions requires that `zlib1g-dev` is installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations.

Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+I strongly urge you to at least skim through the entire section once before you\n+start issuing commands, as it will save you a lot of unncessary pain and\n+anguish.\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](guix-v1.3.0-bootstrap.png)\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+\n+#### Building and installing source-built packages\n+\n+***IMPORTANT**: A few dependencies have non-obvious quirks/erratas which are documented in the\n+sub-sections immediately below. Please read these sections before proceeding to\n+build and install these packages.*\n+\n+Although you should always refer to the README or INSTALL files for the most\n+accurate information, most of these dependencies use autoconf-style build\n+systems (check if there's a `configure.ac` file), and will likely do the right\n+thing with the following:\n+\n+Clone the repository and check out the latest release:\n+```sh\n+git clone <git-repo-of-dependency>/<dependency>.git\n+cd <dependency>\n+git tag -l  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+For autoconf-based build systems (if `./autogen.sh` or `configure.ac` exists at\n+the root of the repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+./autogen.sh || autoreconf -vfi\n+./configure --prefix=<prefix>\n+make\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+For CMake-based build systems (if `CMakeLists.txt` exists at the root of the\n+repository):\n+\n+```sh\n+mkdir build && cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>\n+sudo cmake --build . --target install\n+```\n+\n+If you choose not to specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure`, please\n+make sure you've carefully read the [previous section] on mixing distribution\n+packages and source-built packages.\n+\n+##### Binding packages require `-dev`-suffixed packages\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Everyone\n+\n+When building bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package\n+needs to be installed. For example, building `Guile-zlib` on Debian-derived\n+distributions requires that `zlib1g-dev` is installed.\n+\n+When using bindings, the `-dev`-suffixed version of the original package still\n+needs to be installed. This is particularly problematic when distribution\n+packages are mispackaged like `guile-sqlite3` is in Ubuntu Focal such that\n+installing `guile-sqlite3` does not automatically install `libsqlite3-dev` as a\n+dependency.\n+\n+Below is a list of relevant Guile bindings and their corresponding `-dev`\n+packages in Debian at the time of writing.\n+\n+| Guile binding package | -dev Debian package |\n+|-----------------------|---------------------|\n+| guile-gcrypt          | libgcrypt-dev       |\n+| guile-git             | libgit2-dev         |\n+| guile-lzlib           | liblz-dev           |\n+| guile-ssh             | libssh-dev          |\n+| guile-sqlite3         | libsqlite3-dev      |\n+| guile-zlib            | zlib1g-dev          |\n+\n+##### `guile-git` actually depends on `libgit2 >= 1.1`\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `guile-git` from source against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+- Those installing `guile-git` from their distribution where `guile-git` is\n+  built against `libgit2 < 1.1`\n+\n+As of v0.4.0, `guile-git` claims to only require `libgit2 >= 0.28.0`, however,\n+it actually requires `libgit2 >= 1.1`, otherwise, it will be confused by a\n+reference of `origin/keyring`: instead of interpreting the reference as \"the\n+'keyring' branch of the 'origin' remote\", the reference is interpreted as \"the\n+branch literally named 'origin/keyring'\"\n+\n+This is especially notable because Ubuntu Focal packages `libgit2 v0.28.4`, and\n+`guile-git` is built against it.\n+\n+Should you be in this situation, you need to build both `libgit2 v1.1.x` and\n+`guile-git` from source.\n+\n+Source: http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix/2020-11-12.log#232527\n+\n+##### `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 and v1.0.9 are broken for Guile v2.2\n+\n+Relevant for:\n+- Those building `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` from source against Guile v2.2\n+\n+Commit\n+[707eea3](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/707eea3a85e1e375e86702229ebf73d496377669)\n+introduced a regression for Guile v2.2 and was first included in v1.0.8, this\n+was later corrected in commit\n+[ec9a721](https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures/commit/ec9a721957c17bcda13148f8faa5f06934431ff7)\n+and included in v1.1.0.\n+\n+TL;DR If you decided to use Guile v2.2, do not use `{scheme,guile}-bytestructures` v1.0.8 or v1.0.9.\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix itself\n+\n+Start by cloning Guix:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git\n+cd guix\n+```\n+\n+You will likely want to build the latest release, however, if the latest release\n+when you're reading this is still 1.2.0 then you may want to use 95aca29 instead\n+to avoid a problem in the GnuTLS test suite.\n+\n+```\n+git branch -a -l 'origin/version-*'  # check for the latest release\n+git checkout <latest-release>\n+```\n+\n+Bootstrap the build system:\n+```\n+./bootstrap\n+```\n+\n+Configure with the recommended `--localstatedir` flag:\n+```\n+./configure --localstatedir=/var\n+```\n+\n+Note: If you intend to hack on Guix in the future, you will need to supply the\n+same `--localstatedir=` flag for all future Guix `./configure` invocations. See\n+the last paragraph of this\n+[section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) for more\n+details.\n+\n+Build Guix (this will take a while):\n+```\n+make -j$(nproc)\n+```\n+\n+Install Guix:\n+\n+```\n+sudo make install\n+```\n+\n+### Post-\"build from source\" Setup\n+\n+#### Creating and starting a `guix-daemon-original` service with a fixed `argv[0]`\n+\n+At this point, guix will be installed to `${bindir}`, which is likely\n+`/usr/local/bin` if you did not override directory variables at\n+`./configure`-time. More information on standard Automake directory variables\n+can be found\n+[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Standard-Directory-Variables.html).\n+\n+However, the Guix init scripts and service configurations for Upstart, systemd,\n+SysV, and OpenRC are installed to launch\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon`,\n+which does not yet exist, and will only exist after `root` performs their first\n+`guix pull`. TODO: Link to `guix pull` as root section\n+\n+We need to create a `-original` version of these init scripts that's pointed to\n+the binaries we just built and `make install`'ed in `${bindir}` (normally,\n+`/usr/local/bin`).\n+\n+Example for `systemd`, run as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+# Create guix-daemon-original.service by modifying guix-daemon.service\n+bindir=\"$(dirname $(command -v guix-daemon))\"\n+sed -E -e \"s|/\\S*/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix-daemon|${bindir}/guix-daemon|\" /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon.service > /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon-original.service\n+\n+# Make systemd recognize the new service\n+systemctl daemon-reload\n+\n+# Make sure that the non-working guix-daemon.service is stopped and disabled\n+systemctl stop guix-daemon\n+systemctl disable guix-daemon\n+\n+# Make sure that the working guix-daemon-original.service is started and enabled\n+systemctl enable guix-daemon-original\n+systemctl start guix-daemon-original\n+```\n+\n+#### Creating `guix-daemon` users / groups\n+\n+Please see the [relevant\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Build-Environment-Setup.html)\n+in the Guix Reference Manual for more details.\n+\n+## Optional setup\n+\n+At this point, you are set up to [use Guix to build bitcoin](./README.md#usage).\n+However, if you want to polish your setup a bit and make it \"what Guix\n+intended\", then read the next few subsections.\n+\n+### Add an `/etc/profile.d` entry\n+\n+This section definitely does not apply to you if you installed Guix using:\n+1. The shell installer script\n+2. fanquake's Docker image\n+3. Debian's `guix` package\n+\n+#### Background\n+\n+Although Guix knows how to update itself and its packages, it does so in a\n+non-invasive way (it does not modify `/usr/local/bin/guix`).\n+\n+Instead, it does the following:\n+\n+- After a `guix pull`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/current-guix`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.config/guix/current`\n+\n+- After a `guix install`, it updates\n+  `/var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER/guix-profile`, and creates a symlink\n+  targeting this directory at `$HOME/.guix-profile`\n+\n+Therefore, in order for these operations to affect your shell/desktop sessions\n+(and for the principle of least astonishment to hold), their corresponding\n+directories have to be added to well-known environment variables like `$PATH`,\n+`$INFOPATH`, `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, etc.\n+\n+In other words, if `$HOME/.config/guix/current/bin` does not exist in your\n+`$PATH`, a `guix pull` will have no effect on what `guix` you are using. Same\n+goes for `$HOME/.guix-profile/bin`, `guix install`, and installed packages.\n+\n+Helpfully, after a `guix pull` or `guix install`, a message will be printed like\n+so:\n+\n+```\n+hint: Consider setting the necessary environment variables by running:\n+\n+     GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+     . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+Alternately, see `guix package --search-paths -p \"$HOME/.guix-profile\"'.\n+```\n+\n+However, this is somewhat tedious to do for both `guix pull` and `guix install`\n+for each user on the system that wants to properly use `guix`. I recommend that\n+you instead add an entry to `/etc/profile.d` instead. This is done by default\n+when installing the Debian package later than 1.2.0-4 and when using the shell\n+script installer.\n+\n+#### Instructions\n+\n+Create `/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` with the following content:\n+```sh\n+# _GUIX_PROFILE: `guix pull` profile\n+_GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.config/guix/current\"\n+if [ -L $_GUIX_PROFILE ]; then\n+  export PATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/bin${PATH:+:}$PATH\"\n+  # Export INFOPATH so that the updated info pages can be found\n+  # and read by both /usr/bin/info and/or $GUIX_PROFILE/bin/info\n+  # When INFOPATH is unset, add a trailing colon so that Emacs\n+  # searches 'Info-default-directory-list'.\n+  export INFOPATH=\"$_GUIX_PROFILE/share/info:$INFOPATH\"\n+fi\n+\n+# GUIX_PROFILE: User's default profile\n+GUIX_PROFILE=\"$HOME/.guix-profile\"\n+[ -L $GUIX_PROFILE ] || return\n+GUIX_LOCPATH=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/lib/locale\"\n+export GUIX_PROFILE GUIX_LOCPATH\n+\n+[ -f \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\" ] && . \"$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile\"\n+\n+# set XDG_DATA_DIRS to include Guix installations\n+export XDG_DATA_DIRS=\"$GUIX_PROFILE/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS:-/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/}\"\n+```\n+\n+Please note that this will not take effect until the next shell or desktop\n+session (log out and log back in).\n+\n+### `guix pull` as root\n+\n+Before you do this, you need to read the section on [choosing your security\n+model][security-model] and adjust `guix` and `guix-daemon` flags according to\n+your choice, as invoking `guix pull` may pull substitutes from substitute\n+servers (which you may not want).\n+\n+As mentioned in a previous section, Guix expects\n+`${localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix` to be populated with\n+`root`'s Guix profile, `guix pull`-ed and built by some former version of Guix.\n+However, this is not the case when we build from source. Therefore, we need to\n+perform a `guix pull` as `root`:\n+\n+```sh\n+sudo --login guix pull --branch=version-<latest-release-version>\n+# or\n+sudo --login guix pull --commit=<particular-commit>\n+```\n+\n+`guix pull` is quite a long process (especially if you're using",

However, you will likely\n+need this entry for better desktop integration. Please see [this\n+section](#add-an-etcprofiled-entry) for instructions on how to add a\n+`/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+### Debian 11 (Bullseye)/Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix).\n+\n+Note that if you intend on using Guix without using any substitutes (more\n+details [here][security-model]), v1.2.0 has a known problems when building\n+GnuTLS from source.

Please see [this\n+section](#add-an-etcprofiled-entry) for instructions on how to add a\n+`/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+Note that this section is based on the distro packaging situation at the time of\n+writing (July 2021).

However, you will likely\n+need this entry for better desktop integration. Please see [this\n+section](#add-an-etcprofiled-entry) for instructions on how to add a\n+`/etc/profile.d/guix.sh` entry.\n+\n+Regardless of which installation option you chose, the changes to\n+`/etc/profile.d` will not take effect until the next shell or desktop session,\n+so you should log out and log back in.\n+\n+## Option 3: Using fanquake's Docker image\n+\n+Please refer to fanquake's instructions\n+[here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/guix).\n+\n+Note that the `Dockerfile` is largely equivalent to running through the binary\n+tarball installation steps.\n+\n+## Option 4: Using a distribution-maintained package\n+\n+Note that this section is based on the distro packaging situation at the time of\n+writing (July 2021). Guix is expected to be more widely packaged over time. For\n+an up-to-date view on Guix's package status/version across distros, please see:\n+https://repology.org/project/guix/versions\n+\n+### Debian 11 (Bullseye)/Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)\n+\n+Guix v1.2.0 is available as a distribution package starting in [Debian\n+11](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/guix) and [Ubuntu\n+21.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/guix).\n+\n+Note that if you intend on using Guix without using any substitutes (more\n+details [here][security-model]), v1.2.0 has a known problems when building\n+GnuTLS from source. Solutions and workarounds are documented\n+[here](#gnutls-test-suite-fail-status-request-revoked).\n+\n+\n+To install:\n+```sh\n+sudo apt install guix\n+```\n+\n+For up-to-date information on Debian and Ubuntu's release history:\n+- [Debian release history](https://www.debian.org/releases/)\n+- [Ubuntu release history](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)\n+\n+### Arch Linux\n+\n+Guix is available in the AUR as\n+[`guix`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/guix/), please follow the\n+installation instructions in the Arch Linux Wiki ([live\n+link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Guix#AUR_Package_Installation),\n+[2021/03/30\n+permalink](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Guix&oldid=637559#AUR_Package_Installation))\n+to install Guix.\n+\n+At the time of writing (2021/03/30), the `check` phase will fail if the path to\n+guix's build directory is longer than 36 characters due to an anachronistic\n+character limit on the shebang line. Since the `check` phase happens after the\n+`build` phase, which may take quite a long time, it is recommended that users\n+either:\n+\n+1. Skip the `check` phase\n+    - For `makepkg`: `makepkg --nocheck ...`\n+    - For `yay`: `yay --mflags=\"--nocheck\" ...`\n+    - For `paru`: `paru --nocheck ...`\n+2. Or, check their build directory's length beforehand\n+    - For those building with `makepkg`: `pwd | wc -c`\n+\n+## Option 5: Building from source\n+\n+Building Guix from source is a rather involved process but a rewarding one for\n+those looking to minimize trust and maximize customizability (e.g. building a\n+particular commit of Guix). Previous experience with using autotools-style build\n+systems to build packages from source will be helpful. *hic sunt dracones.*\n+\n+I strongly urge you to at least skim through the entire section once before you\n+start issuing commands, as it will save you a lot of unncessary pain and\n+anguish.\n+\n+### Installing common build tools\n+\n+There are a few basic build tools that are required for most things we'll build,\n+so let's install them now:\n+\n+Text transformation/i18n:\n+- `autopoint` (sometimes packaged in `gettext`)\n+- `help2man`\n+- `po4a`\n+- `texinfo`\n+\n+Build system tools:\n+- `g++` w/ C++11 support\n+- `libtool`\n+- `autoconf`\n+- `automake`\n+- `pkg-config` (sometimes packaged as `pkgconf`)\n+- `make`\n+- `cmake`\n+\n+Miscellaneous:\n+- `git`\n+- `gnupg`\n+- `python3`\n+\n+### Building and Installing Guix's dependencies\n+\n+In order to build Guix itself from source, we need to first make sure that the\n+necessary dependencies are installed and discoverable. The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6399679/125064185-a9a59880-e0b0-11eb-82c1-9b8e5dc9950d.png)\n+\n+#### Guile\n+\n+##### Choosing a Guile version and sticking to it\n+\n+One of the first things you need to decide is which Guile version you want to\n+use: Guile v2.2 or Guile v3.0. Unlike the python2 to python3 transition, Guile\n+v2.2 and Guile v3.0 are largely compatible, as evidenced by the fact that most\n+Guile packages and even [Guix\n+itself](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/guile-3-and-guix/) support running on\n+both.\n+\n+What is important here is that you **choose one**, and you **remain consistent**\n+with your choice throughout **all Guile-related packages**, no matter if they\n+are installed via the distribution's package manager or installed from source.\n+This is because the files for Guile packages are installed to directories which\n+are separated based on the Guile version.\n+\n+###### Example: Checking that Ubuntu's `guile-git` is compatible with your chosen Guile version\n+\n+On Ubuntu Focal:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures, libgit2-dev\n+...\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the package `guile-git` depends on `guile-2.2`, meaning that it\n+was likely built for Guile v2.2. This means that if you decided to use Guile\n+v3.0 on Ubuntu Focal, you would need to build guile-git from source instead of\n+using the distribution package.\n+\n+On Ubuntu Hirsute:\n+\n+```sh\n+$ apt show guile-git\n+Package: guile-git\n+...\n+Depends: guile-3.0 | guile-2.2, guile-bytestructures (>= 1.0.7-3~), libgit2-dev (>= 1.0)\n+...\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `guile-git` depends on either `guile-3.0` or `guile-2.2`, meaning\n+that it would work no matter what Guile version you decided to use.\n+\n+###### Corner case: Multiple versions of Guile on one system\n+\n+It is recommended to only install one version of Guile, so that build systems do\n+not get confused about which Guile to use.\n+\n+However, if you insist on having both Guile v2.2 and Guile v3.0 installed on\n+your system, then you need to **consistently** specify one of\n+`GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=3.0` or `GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION=2.2` to all\n+`./configure` invocations for Guix and its dependencies.\n+\n+##### Installing Guile\n+\n+Guile is most likely already packaged for your distribution, so after you have\n+[chosen a Guile version](#choosing-a-guile-version-and-sticking-to-it), install\n+it via your distribution's package manager.\n+\n+If your distribution splits packages into `-dev`-suffixed and\n+non-`-dev`-suffixed sub-packages (as is the case for Debian-derived\n+distributions), please make sure to install both. For example, to install Guile\n+v2.2 on Debian/Ubuntu:\n+\n+```sh\n+apt install guile-2.2 guile-2.2-dev\n+```\n+\n+#### Mixing distribution packages and source-built packages\n+\n+At the time of writing, most distributions have _some_ of Guix's dependencies\n+packaged, but not all. This means that you may want to install the distribution\n+package for some dependencies, and manually build-from-source for others.\n+\n+Distribution packages usually install to `/usr`, which is different from the\n+default `./configure` prefix of source-built packages: `/usr/local`.\n+\n+This means that if you mix-and-match distribution packages and source-built\n+packages and do not specify exactly `--prefix=/usr` to `./configure` for\n+source-built packages, you will need to augment the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH` and\n+`GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH` environment variables so that Guile will look\n+under the right prefix and find your source-built packages.\n+\n+For example, if you are using Guile v2.2, and have Guile packages in the\n+`/usr/local` prefix, either add the following lines to your `.profile` or\n+`.bash_profile` so that the environment variable is properly set for all future\n+shell logins, or paste the lines into a POSIX-style shell to temporarily modify\n+the environment variables of your current shell session.\n+\n+```sh\n+# Help Guile v2.2.x find packages in /usr/local\n+export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=\"/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH\"\n+export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH\"\n+```\n+\n+Note that these environment variables are used to check for packages during\n+`./configure`, so they should be set as soon as possible should you want to use\n+a prefix other than `/usr`.\n+\n+<!-- ##### Example: Consistently using Guile 3.0 on Ubuntu -->\n+\n+<!-- For example, on Ubuntu, if you choose to use Guile 3.0 and install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-3.0` package, you want to make sure that if you also want to install the -->\n+<!-- `guile-git` package with `apt` that said `guile-git` package was built for Guile -->\n+<!-- v3.0. This can be checked by invoking the following: -->\n+\n+<!-- ``` -->\n+<!-- apt update -->\n+<!-- apt show guile-git -->\n+<!-- ``` -->",

The most up-to-date list\n+of Guix's dependencies is kept in the [\"Requirements\"\n+section](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) of the Guix\n+Reference Manual.\n+\n+Depending on your distribution, most or all of these dependencies may already be\n+packaged and installable without manually building and installing.\n+\n+For reference, the graphic below outlines Guix v1.3.0's dependency graph:\n+\n+![boostrap map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6399679/125064185-a9a59880-e0b0-11eb-82c1-9b8e5dc9950d.png)",
