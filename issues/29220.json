    "body": "The `-maxtxfee` (which is put into `m_default_max_tx_fee` is documented as \"the maximum total fees to use in a single wallet transaction\"\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/632a2bb731804dffe52bd4cbd90bfee352d25ede/src/wallet/init.cpp#L63\r\n\r\nThis seems true in many instances when we look at the code:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/632a2bb731804dffe52bd4cbd90bfee352d25ede/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L1293-L1295\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/632a2bb731804dffe52bd4cbd90bfee352d25ede/src/wallet/feebumper.cpp#L114-L119\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/632a2bb731804dffe52bd4cbd90bfee352d25ede/src/node/transaction.cpp#L71-L79\r\n\r\nBut there are also places where this value is used as a feerate per KvB:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/632a2bb731804dffe52bd4cbd90bfee352d25ede/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L3061-L3064\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/632a2bb731804dffe52bd4cbd90bfee352d25ede/src/wallet/rpc/spend.cpp#L433\r\n\r\nI don't think these instances of conversions to feerate result in anything very problematic, but it doesn't make sense to just convert this fee to a feerate because not every tx is the same size. I can see why a wallet user might want a maximum fee and maximum feerate, so maybe we should have both options?",
