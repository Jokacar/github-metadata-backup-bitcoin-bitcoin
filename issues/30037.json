    "title": "RfC: increase minimum prune target?",
    "body": "The minimum pruning target of `550MiB` was chosen based on a physical block size of `1 MiB`, see  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f5b6f621fff7540ca97974b26a66ca1cc6db018c/src/validation.h#L69-L76\r\nWe never prune files within 288 blocks from the tip, so the size limit will not be respected if these blocks take up more space.\r\n\r\nSince physical block sizes have increased since segwit, I think that there is no benefit to choosing `-prune=550` as opposed to `-prune=1000`:\r\nRunning with the smaller value will likely slow down IBD a bit (because we prune / flush chainstate more often), but once we are getting closer to the tip, the blockfile directory will be between `700MiB` and `900 MiB`, so we'll need more disk space eventually anyway (also, today's chainstate is > 12 GiB, which is large in comparison).\r\n\r\nSo I wonder if we should\r\n* increase the limit in a hard way - this would be an inconvenience to lots of existing users who would need to update their `bitcoin.conf` to be able to start bitcoind.\r\n* increase it in a soft way, something like disrepecting it on purpose by setting it to a higher value, but without an init error.\r\n* add a comment to the `-prune` doc that values around 550MiB are pointless.\r\n* do nothing",
