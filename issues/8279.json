    "body": "Noticed this in my code review: https://petertodd.org/2016/segwit-consensus-critical-code-review#peer-to-peer-networking\n\nBasically it looks like an attacker may be able to send nodes transactions with malleated witness data, which we don't consistently mark as possibly corrupted in AcceptToMemoryPool(). Result would be those txids being added to recentRejects, messing up propagation.\n\nThat said, I haven't actually tested this yet; about to go off to a conference, so if someone else wants to confirm for me that'd be much appreciated! Or if I'm wrong you're welcome to all laugh at my expense. :)\n\nCC: @sdaftuar @sipa \n",

          "body": "~~Fixes #8279~~\n\nIn addition to the problem highlighted in that issue, there's an additional, related problem in the sigops policy check.  Because witness sigops are counted without checking that the witness program matches the commitment in the scriptPubKey being spent, it's possible to change a transaction's witness to cause the sigops policy check to fail, without changing the txid.\n\nSimilarly, because the bytes-per-sigop check is affected by the size of the transaction including the witness, it's possible to even remove a witness and cause that sigops check to fail, again without changing the txid.\n\n~~So this PR does the following:~~\n- ~~Moves the IsStandard check to happen after checking for premature-witness.

If not, the rejects filter would be useless since the node needs to know to not re-request rejected txs that are listed in INVs (which only use txid).\n\nThere might still be a solution here to avoid changing the p2p protocol and mempool. The one I'm thinking of: if the `GetTransactionCost()` check fails, do a contextual check on the on the tx to verify that the witnesses are actually redeeming witness program coins. If they're not, ban the peer but do _not_ add the txid to the rejects filter.\n\nMaybe do this for every failure before it gets to the contextual checks. Once it hits the contextual checks in the mempool, AreInputsStandard could check to make sure witnesses are redeeming witness program coins before continuing.\n\nNot ideal, but maybe good enough in practice.\n\nedit: Hmm, nevermind my idea. I guess an attacker could still mutate real witness transactions without changing the txid. A wtxid mempool+inv-packets might be the only solution. This is rough.\n",

      "body": "@chjj I hadn't written it up yet, but this is what I concluded as well.  Post-segwit, the fee rate check that we perform to determine whether a transaction might be able to enter the mempool can fail, without us being able to tell whether the txid is permanently bad -- eg for all you know there exists some slightly smaller witness which causes the feerate to be just high enough to make it in to the mempool.\n\nAs I think the fee rate check is far and away the most valuable thing to be caching success/failure in `recentRejects`, either we have to scrap that performance improvement, or maybe rework mempool acceptance to not perform these checks until after scripts have been validated (not sure how feasible this would be), or somehow remember and request transactions based on what we remember about the particular witness we previously evaluated.  This last approach -- reworking the p2p-layer to be based on wtxid's when upgraded peers communicate -- seems the most logical to me, but others may have a different view?\n",

      "body": "Some ideas (based on an IRC discussion yesterday):\n1. Switch to a wtxids based invs/getdatas, as well as wtxid-indexed mempool, relay pool, and p2p logic.\n2. Relay resource cost information along with invs (fees, size, sigops). This would allow the receiver to decide ahead of time whether to accept a transaction, removing this as reason for entering the rejection cache (making it much less needed).\n3. Alternatively, extend BIP133 (feefilter) to have mandatory behaviour. This effectively does the same as (2), except the sender is responsible for filtering ahead of time.\n4. Remove the \"invalid witness does not cause insertion in rejectioncache\" rule entirely. This would simplify the code a lot, and (with the current protocol) does not allow an attacker to do anything they can't do already (independent from segwit), namely preventing a single peer from hearing about a transaction before it confirms. The rule does not work when transactions have intentionally malleable witnesses anyway.\n5. Verify all received transactions fully (assuming we requested them), even if we know we won't accept them due to feerate limits. This would allow us to determine conclusively whether the transaction was invalid (in which case we should never ask for it again) or malleated (in which case we should ban the node that sent it, but ask for it again from other peers). This has been suggested long before segwit as a means to detect other DoS attacks. Since by the time we get this option we've done most of the work already anyway (bandwidth was wasted, and UTXO entries were retrieved from the database), doing the actual script validation is not a huge amount of work anymore.\n\nMy preference is initially just (4), and perhaps (3) and (5) at some point as orthogonal optimizations. Things like (1) and (2) can be incorportated in a future reworked relay mechanism, perhaps one that works based on mempool synchronization rather than individual transaction relay.\n\nI expect (4) to be the most controversial option, but it is also the only one that actually simplifies implementation.\n",

      "body": "> Remove the \"invalid witness does not cause insertion in rejectioncache\" rule entirely. This would simplify the code a lot, and (with the current protocol) does not allow an attacker to do anything they can't do already (independent from segwit), namely preventing a single peer from hearing about a transaction before it confirms. The rule does not work when transactions have intentionally malleable witnesses anyway.\n\nThis strikes me as problematic, as it seems like it'd be very straightforward for an attacker to harm transaction relay across the network by appending junk witness data, causing a transaction to fail to propagate.  It only requires one connection slot to many peers to cause this kind of failure (as opposed to announcing but not delivering a tx, which requires at least taking up numerous connection slots of a peer to be effective, since we try to request a given transaction several times before giving up -- also this p2p logic could be improved, say by preferring tx downloads from outbound peers, or disconnecting nodes that have high tx-withholding rates, etc).\n\n(3) seems fine in concept, but insufficient to address this issue by itself.\n\n(2) might be sufficient now, and may be a reasonable change in our current environment, but it seems to me like there might at some point be a gap between what we announce with the inv and what we use for policy limits, and having to adapt the p2p layer to adjust for policy changes seems like a bad road to go down.  (For instance, if we were to impose a policy rule on the size of the witness stack, then this would be insufficient.)\n\n(1) seems like the most obviously correct solution to me, as it directly addresses the issue (namely, whether we have processed the same data before), and is analogous to what we do pre-segwit (use a tx identifier that commits to all the tx data).  (5) seems like it might also be a reasonably robust solution, but with the wide range of scripts now permitted I don't have an intuition for whether this could be problematic as a potential CPU-DoS issue, and there's an extra mental leap regarding transactions with intentional malleability (no idea if such things exist on the network today though), that makes it slightly harder to reason about.\n\nSo I'd propose we do (1), even though it's a bit of a bigger change at the p2p level.\n",

This changes the meaning for state.CorruptionPossible() for transactions from \"witness possibly invalidated\" to \"witness stripped\". This is faster (no need for 3 script checks) and simpler for the DoS logic.\n\nThis also removes the special logic to not assign DoS for witness failures for non-witness peers. That logic already exists in more generic form, through the non-mandatory script verify flags.\n\nSee also #8279.\n",

See #8593.\n",

But we still want to detect non standard transactions, that are non-witness.\r\n\r\nIn case of witness transaction, `verifyResult` will fail because there is no witness. But if there's no error with VERIFY_WITNESS, it means we have CLEANSTACK issue and transaction is not standard one.\r\n\r\nWithout this check, it would not reject non-standard P2SH from the mempool reject cache.",

While that is a quick check, it is very imprecise (eg if those outputs were already spent in another block, we wouldn't detect that the transaction has already been confirmed) -- we can do better by just keeping a rolling bloom filter of the transactions in recent blocks, which will better capture the case of a transaction which has been confirmed and then fully spent. \r\n\r\nThis should reduce the bandwidth that we waste by requesting transactions which will not be accepted to the mempool.\r\n\r\nTo avoid relay problems for transactions which have been included in a recent block but then reorged out of the chain, we clear the bloom filter whenever a block is disconnected.",

          "title": "Use wtxid for transaction relay",
          "body": "Using txids (a transaction's hash, without witness) for transaction relay is problematic, post-segwit -- if a peer gives us a segwit transaction that fails policy checks, it could be because the txid associated with the transaction is definitely unacceptable to our node (regardless of the witness), or it could be that the transaction was malleated and with a different witness, the txid could be accepted to our mempool.\r\n\r\nWe have a bloom filter of recently rejected transactions, whose purpose is to help us avoid redownloading and revalidating transactions that fail to be accepted, but because of this potential for witness malleability to interfere with relay of valid transactions, we do not use the filter for segwit transactions.  This issue is discussed at some length in #8279.  The effect of this is that whenever a segwit transaction that fails policy checks is relayed, a node would download that transaction from every peer announcing it, because it has no way presently to cache failure.  Historically this hasn't been a big problem, but if/when policy for accepting segwit transactions were to change (eg taproot, or any other change), we could expect older nodes talking to newer nodes to be wasting bandwidth because of this.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in that issue, switching to wtxid-based relay solves this problem -- by using an identifier for a transaction that commits to all the data in our relay protocol, we can be certain if a transaction that a peer is announcing is one that we've already tried to process, or if it's something new.  This PR introduces support for wtxid-based relay with peers that support it (and remains backwards compatible with peers that use txids for relay, of course).\r\n\r\nApart from code correctness, one issue to be aware of is that by downloading from old and new peers alike, we should expect there to be some bandwidth wasted, because sometimes we might download the same transaction via txid-relay as well as wtxid-relay.  The last commit in this PR implements a heuristic I want to analyze, which is to just delay relay from txid-relay peers by 2 seconds, if we have at least 1 wtxid-based peer.  I've just started running a couple nodes with this heuristic so I can measure how well it works, but I'm open to other ideas for minimizing that issue.  In the long run, I think this will be essentially a non-issue, so I don't think it's too big a concern, we just need to bite the bullet and deal with it during upgrade.\r\n\r\nFinally, this proposal would need a simple BIP describing the changes, which I haven't yet drafted.  However, review and testing of this code in the interim would be welcome.\r\n\r\nTo do items:\r\n- [x] Write BIP explaining the spec here (1 new p2p message for negotiating wtxid-based relay, along with a new INV type)\r\n- [ ] Measure and evaluate a heuristic for minimizing how often a node downloads the same transaction twice, when connected to old and new nodes.",
