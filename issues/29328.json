      "body": "The RPCs should probably be fixed to never return fake values.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty easy to tell when the `nTx` value is fake. You can just call [`IsValid()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/478ac185be49feffd1231366c07e06068683f941/src/chain.h#L306), and if it returns true, the `nTx` value is real, and if it returns false, the value is fake.\r\n\r\nIt is less straightforward to determine when the `nChainTx` is fake, but we could introduce a helper function to do that which could be used by these RPCs and also be useful for #29299. If `nChainTx` is greater than 0, and nSequenceId is not 0 or `BLOCK_ASSUMED_VALID` is not set or the block is the snapshot block, then `nChainTx` value is real. Otherwise the `nChainTx` is probably fake. This check could falsely indicate that real `nChainTx` values were fake in the interval between blocks being downloaded and fully validated, but this should not be a big deal.\r\n\r\nIn the long run it would be better to just not set fake values. According to a comment in [`PopulateAndValidateSnapshot`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/478ac185be49feffd1231366c07e06068683f941/src/validation.cpp#L5540) these values are only faked so that [`GuessVerificationProgress`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/478ac185be49feffd1231366c07e06068683f941/src/validation.cpp#L5116) works better. I don't know if this is true, but if it is true, it seems like `GuessVerificationProgress` could just report progress based on block heights instead of transaction counts below the snapshot height, and we could get rid of the fake values, leaving nTx and nChainTx set to 0 when unknown and nonzero when known.",

Maybe the practical consequences would not be too bad if it just causes nTx to be omitted from rpc results when in some cases it shouldn't be. But this seems like another reason to want get rid of the fake assumeutxo nTx and nChainTx values, so we can simply treat 0 values as invalid, and nonzero values as valid.\r\n\r\nEDIT: It also seems like BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS flag is not removed if a block is marked invalid (a BLOCK_FAILED_VALID flag is added instead). So code could check the BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS directly to see if nTx is valid.",
