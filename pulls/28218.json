    "body": "This change makes `IsInitialBlockDownload` and `NotifyHeaderTip` functions no longer tied to individual `Chainstate` objects. It makes them work with the `ChainstateManager` object instead so code is simpler and it is no longer possible to call them incorrectly with an inactive `Chainstate`.\r\n\r\nThis change also makes `m_cached_finished_ibd` caching easier to reason about, because now there is only one cached value instead of two (for background and snapshot chainstates) so the cached IBD state now no longer gets reset when a snapshot is loaded.\r\n\r\nThere should be no change in behavior because these functions were always called on the active `ChainState` objects.\r\n\r\nThese changes were discussed previously https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27746#discussion_r1246868905 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27746#discussion_r1237552792 as possible followups for that PR.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

      "message": "assumeutxo cleanup: Move IsInitialBlockDownload & NotifyHeaderTip to ChainstateManager\n\nThis change makes IsInitialBlockDownload and NotifyHeaderTip functions no\nlonger tied to individual Chainstate objects. It makes them work with the\nChainstateManager object instead so code is simpler and it is no longer\npossible to call them incorrectly with an inactive Chainstate.\n\nThis change also makes m_cached_finished_ibd caching easier to reason about,\nbecause now there is only one cached value instead of two (for background and\nsnapshot chainstates) so the cached IBD state now no longer gets reset when a\nsnapshot is loaded.\n\nThere should be no change in behavior because these functions were always\ncalled on the active ChainState objects.\n\nThese changes were discussed previously\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27746#discussion_r1246868905 and\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27746#discussion_r1237552792 as\npossible followups for that PR.",
