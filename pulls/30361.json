Not convinced that's very beneficial though.\r\n\r\nI don't think there's much other benefit to splitting potential problems up from actual problems otherwise if the admin still needs to attend to them either way, though; so if we're already making LogError just mean actual errors; is there any reason not to merge them both into a single LogAlert() or similar?",
