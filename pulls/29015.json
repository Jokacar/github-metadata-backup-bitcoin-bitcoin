    "body": "Remove `fees.h`, `errors.h`, and `spanparsing.h` from the util library. Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Move `Split` functions from `util/spanparsing.h` to `util/string.h`, using `util` namespace for clarity.\r\n- Move remaining spanparsing functions to `script/parsing.h` since they are used for descriptor and miniscript parsing.\r\n- Combine `util/fees.h` and `util/errors.h` into `common/messages.h` so there is a place for simple functions that generate user messages to live, and these functions are not part of the util library.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this change is that the util library is a dependency of the kernel, and we should remove functionality from util that shouldn't be called by kernel code or kernel applications. These changes should also improve code organization and make functions easier to discover. Some of these same moves are (or were) part of #28690, but did not help with code organization, or made it worse, so it is better to move them and clean them up in the same PR so code only has to change one time.\r\n",

This could be useful in the future for using or testing these classes without having to instantiate any form of signal handling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587). It improves the kernel API and removes two modules from the kernel library.",

This removes `BCLog::Level::None` entirely -- for `LogFlags::NONE` just use `Level::Info`, for any actual category, use `Level::Debug`.\r\n\r\nAdds docs to developer-notes about when to use which level.\r\n\r\nAdds `-loglevelalways=1` option so that you get `[net:debug]`, `[all:info]`, `[all:warning]` etc, which might be helpful for automated parsing, or just if you like everything to be consistent. Defaults to off to reduce noise in the default config, and to avoid unnecessary changes on upgrades.\r\n\r\nChanges the behaviour of `LogPrintLevel(CATEGORY, BCLog::Level::Info, ...)` to be logged unconditionally, rather than only being an additional optional logging level in addition to trace and debug. Does not change the behaviour of `LogPrintLevel(NONE, Debug, ...)` and `LogPrintLevel(NONE, Trace, ...)` being no-ops.",

This PR makes it possible to access these parameters directly by name. This is achieved by holding the parameters in a separate `JSONRPCParameters` class which contains mappings from both name to value, and position to value. Two `operator[]` methods are implemented which can accept both strings and ints. This allows for backwards compatibility, while also allowing for future implementation to access the parameters by name.\r\n\r\nThe processing of named arguments ends up being entirely overhauled in order to be able to store the mappings to the parameters.\r\n\r\nBased on #26485 to avoid conflicting with it.",

With this patch built locally you can test with your own filesystem path (example):\r\n\r\n`tor --SocksPort unix:/Users/matthewzipkin/torsocket/x`\r\n\r\n`bitcoind -proxy=unix:/Users/matthewzipkin/torsocket/x`\r\n\r\nPrep work for this feature includes:\r\n- Moving where and how we create `sockaddr` and `Sock` to accommodate `AF_UNIX` without disturbing `CService`\r\n- Expanding `Proxy` class to represent either a `CService` or a UNIX socket (by its file path)\r\n\r\nFuture work:\r\n- Enable UNIX sockets for ZMQ (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27679)\r\n- Enable UNIX sockets for I2P SAM proxy (some code is included in this PR but not tested or exposed to user options yet)\r\n- Enable UNIX sockets on windows where supported\r\n- Update Network Proxies dialog in GUI to support UNIX sockets\r\n",

However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [ ] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick)\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add mempool transactions in a topologically-invalid way.\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts. Is this a problem?",

That would presumably mean util/bitdeque.h and util/sock.cpp should also eventually go elsewhere, for example? That seems like a bad approach to me (in that it means code has to move into and out of util based on whether it's relevant to the kernel, rather than due to any changes to the code itself, and users then potentially have to deal with it moving into/outof the util:: namespace).",

As for now, it reads:\r\n\r\nThis seems like the right place to talk about the relationship between the util and kernel library. My work on the kernel library has been focusing on reducing its essence to validation code, pruning external dependencies, and stripping out as much system related functionality as possible. I think if the goal is to have the kernel be capable of running on as many platforms as possible, potentially beyond the number of platforms that Bitcoin Core is capable of today and extending into embedded environments, this last point becomes crucial.\r\n\r\nLooking at the content of `util` it provides roughly two types of functionality: Utilities for basic data structures and their serialization, and cross-platform system related utilities, like file handling, threading, process handling, etc. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, making the `util` library a proper dependency of the kernel should not introduce new cross-platform system-related content into the kernel library. Besides potentially limiting use cases of the kernel, providing cross-platform utilities beyond what the kernel strictly requires seems like a potentially unreasonable future maintenance burden. This would be contrary to our incremental process of creating a minimal kernel library.\r\n\r\nThe asterisk here is that some of the utilities that are not currently used by the kernel do not introduce new dependencies, since they entirely rely on code that is already used by the kernel. I also generally think that some utilities could remain in the util library even though they are not currently used by validation code. The criteria I propose for evaluating if modules should remain in util after this PR are:\r\n\r\n1. The module is directly used by kernel code.\r\n2. The module contains basic data structure utilities for interacting with kernel code.\r\n3. The module does not contain system-related utilities that are not directly used by the kernel.\r\n4. The module does not contain project-specific code that is not relevant to the kernel.\r\n5. The module does not introduce new dependencies beyond the current dependencies of the kernel.\r\n\r\nLooking at @hebasto's comment [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28690#pullrequestreview-1774033780), `threadinterrupt.cpp` and `readwritefile.cpp` would violate the 3rd criteria in my eyes, while the `spanparsing` and `bytevectorhash` modules could potentially remain in `util`.\r\n\r\nBetween this PR and #28690 I think it would be nice if common criteria for `util` would be defined and documented. All this said, I think it would be acceptable too if things were kept purposefully vague as they are now until the need for more concrete structures arises.",

I could see this being useful in the future if util library started growing a lot and accumulating more features of over time.\r\n\r\nBut for now, IMO, just sticking with the current util/common separation and using the cleanup in this PR would organize things better and be less confusing than having two util versions, and it would require moving fewer things. Even though the libraries.md document is currently ambiguous, I think it should be pretty easy to remove the ambiguity here.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29015#issuecomment-1849026409\r\n\r\n> The criteria I propose for evaluating if modules should remain in util after this PR are:\r\n\r\nI think these are good rules if you replace \"basic data structure utilities\" with \"basic utilities that to do not require outside dependencies\", and also drop the 3rd rule. It seems like with the 3rd rule you are trying to make a distinction between \"data structure utilities\" and \"system-related utilities\", and I don't think it helps to draw a dividing line there.\r\n",

I just don't you need to `rm src/util/sock.cpp` to achieve these goals. As long as the util library is distributed as a static library, or built as a static library and linked into a dynamic library, the socket functions will not be part of resulting executables if they are not called. And if the kernel is being built for a platform which doesn't support sockets at all, `src/util/sock.cpp` can just be stubbed or not compiled at all and there should be no problem for portability either. I do think it's good to keep the util library small and lightweight and remove things which don't fit there. But I don't think it needs to be stripped down in a more extreme way.",

See the original branch for the evolution of the spec.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review? \r\n\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review. Probably starting with ECDH and the Noise Protocol.\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nSilent Payments also needs the ECDH module, so I cherry-picked the commit from #28122. It uses ECDH is a slightly different way, but perhaps there's more overlap to be had.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Upstream issues\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Noise\r\n\r\n- [ ] use EllSwift https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66, implemented in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/28\r\n- [ ] certificate signing issue: https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/717, fix in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/29\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [x] persist static key (needs #29229)\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [x] create `Sv2Transport` subclass similar to `V2Transport`: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/27\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n- [ ] adjust base58 encoding of authority public key https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/721\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [x] hold on to templates a bit after a block is found https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/709 (in case of race to prevent downstream crashes, though we still wouldn't relay it without additional changes)\r\n- [ ] hold on to template transactions even if the mempool drops them (for some time)\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

If larger, fail.\r\n3) The package rbf may not evict more than 100 transactions from the mempool(bip125 rule 5)\r\n4) The package's child tx has greater feerate than the parent tx (otherwise the parent should have RBF'd on its own at step 0)\r\n5) Every directly conflicted mempool transaction is connected to at most 1 other in-mempool transaction (ie the cluster size of the conflict is at most 2).\r\n6) Diagram check: We ensure that the replacement is strictly superior at all points, improving the mempool (which includes bip125 rule 3)\r\n7) The total fee of the package, minus the total fee of what is being evicted, is at least the minrelayfee * size of the package (equivalent to bip125 rule 3 and 4)\r\n\r\nPost-cluster mempool this will likely be expanded to general package rbf, but this is what we can safely support today.\r\n",

However it made no sense to me to store a `CKey` as plain text. See commit \"Persist static key for Template Provider\" for how it's used.\r\n\r\nIt uses a template and leverages the fact that both `std::string` and `std::vector<unsigned char>>` have an `insert()` method that can take a char array.\r\n\r\nThe `unsigned char` support is not used in this PR, but tests do cover it.",

          "body": "Parent PR #28983\r\n\r\nThis is the first part of the Stratum v2 Template Provider change that can be a standalone pull request.\r\n\r\nThe Noise Protocol Framework is defined here: https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html\r\n\r\nIt's quite similar to BIP324. The main differences are explained here, including why Stratum v2 can't use BIP234 (yet): https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/stratum-v2-noise-protocol-bip324-nuggets/413\r\n\r\nThe implementation is based on revision 38, 2018-07-11 (most recent at the time of writing).\r\n\r\nThe Stratum v2 spec defines the specific choice of ciphers: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/04-Protocol-Security.md\r\n\r\nI proposed a modification to the spec to use EllSwift (instead of regular x-only) for the encoding of public keys and ECDH: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66 (see remark below)\r\n\r\nThis protocol has been implemented (modulo a few minor bugs and the above issue) in the Stratum Reference Implementation (SRI, using [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin)). https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum\r\n\r\nIt has also been (independently) implemented in BraiinsOS. This part is currently not open source, and it's behind on some recent changes.\r\n\r\nThe classes in `sv2_noise.h` attempt to stay close to the paper, whereas the test and fuzzer code borrow heavily from BIP324.\r\n\r\nIt's ready for review, but not for merge:\r\n\r\n1. There's a small chance the use of EllSwift won't be accepted into the Stratum v2 spec, or there could be an implementation compatibility issue. I'll update the description when that's done.\r\n2. The parent PR may need more conceptual review (and perhaps the entire spec, but that would really slow things down)\r\n3. We could decide to not support Noise encryption at all and require users to install separate software for that. Code review of this PR could help inform that decision.\r\n\r\nYou can see this code in action in #28983. However the parent PR is used in several Stratum v2 test projects, so I try not to change it too often. It also must be kept bug-for-bug compatible with SRI, where this PR attempts to not have bugs. So at the moment there are three differences (which should go away over time):\r\n\r\n1. the use of EllSwift\r\n2. Bugfix https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/29 (implemented here, but not yet fixed on the SRI side)\r\n3. Various other bug fixes\r\n\r\nInitial seed corpus: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/169",

This enhancement enables users to create a signet that is more conducive to testing. The change enhances the flexibility of signet, rendering it more versatile for various testing scenarios. For instance, I am currently working on setting up a signet with a 30-second block time. However, this caused numerous difficulty adjustments, resulting in an inconsistent network state. Regtest isn't a viable alternative for me in this context since we prefer defaults to utilize our custom signet when configured, without impeding local regtest development.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nIf the challenge format is `OP_RETURN PUSHDATA<params> PUSHDATA<actual challenge>`, the actual challenge from the second data push is used as the signet challenge, and the parameters from the first push are used to configure the network. Otherwise the challenge is used as is.\r\n\r\nThis change is backward-compatible, as per the old rules, such a signet challenge would always evaluate to false, rendering it unused.\r\n\r\nThe only parameter currently available is \"target_spacing\" (default 600 seconds). To set it, place `0x01<target_spacing as uint64_t, little endian>` in the params. Empty params are also valid. If other network parameters are added in the future, they should use `0x02<option 2 value>`, `0x03<option 3 value>`, etc., following the protobuf style.\r\n\r\nTwo public functions were added to `chainparams.h`:\r\n  - `ParseWrappedSignetChallenge`: Extracts signet params and signet challenge from a wrapped signet challenge.\r\n  - `ParseSignetParams`: Parses `<params>` bytes of the first data push.\r\n\r\nFunction `ReadSigNetArgs` calls `ParseWrappedSignetChallenge` and `ParseSignetParams` to implement the new meaning of signetchallenge.\r\n\r\nThe description of the flag `-signetchallenge` was updated to reflect the changes.\r\n\r\nA new unit tests file, `chainparams_tests.cpp`, was added, containing tests for `ParseWrappedSignetChallenge` and `ParseSignetParams`.\r\n\r\nThe test `signet_parse_tests` from the file `validation_tests.cpp` was modified to ensure proper understanding of the new logic.\r\n\r\nIn the functional test `feature_signet.py`, the value of `-signetchallenge` was changed from `OP_TRUE` to the wrapped challenge, setting spacing to 30 seconds and having the same actual challenge `OP_TRUE`.\r\n\r\nThe Signet miner was updated, introducing a new option `--target-spacing` with a default of 600 seconds. It must be set to the value used by the network.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nI tested this PR against [Mutinynet](https://blog.mutinywallet.com/mutinynet/), a signet running on a custom fork of Bitcoin Core, implementing 30s target spacing. I successfully synchronized the blockchain using the following config:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsignet=1\r\n[signet]\r\nsignetchallenge=6a4c09011e000000000000004c25512102f7561d208dd9ae99bf497273e16f389bdbd6c4742ddb8e6b216e64fa2928ad8f51ae\r\naddnode=45.79.52.207:38333\r\ndnsseed=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe content of this wrapped challenge:\r\n\r\n```\r\n6a OP_RETURN\r\n4c OP_PUSHDATA1\r\n09 (length of signet params = 9)\r\n011e00000000000000 (signet params: 0x01, pow_target_spacing=30)\r\n4c OP_PUSHDATA1\r\n25 (length of challenge = 37)\r\n512102f7561d208dd9ae99bf497273e16f389bdbd6c4742ddb8e6b216e64fa2928ad8f51ae\r\n(original Mutinynet challenge)\r\n```",

The main place where `TransactionError` codes are actually used, and the place where the type was introduced in #14978 was in `node/transaction.h` and `node/transaction.cpp` for the `BroadcastTransaction` function. But disappointingly I think, the same type was also reused in other places like wallet code and psbt code, with extra enum values added to support these. I think it would be better if the enum were split up so it would be clearer which functions returned which values, so for example, you would not be goaded by compiler into writing error handling code for enum values that could never be returned. \r\n\r\nWith this background, I thought for this PR putting `TransactionError` in `node` instead of `common` would be better so it would be more likely to be appropriately used for functions like `node::BroadcastTransaction` and `interfaces::Node::broadTransaction`, and less likely to be misused for non-node functions. I could understand the opposite argument, though, that if even if it belongs in `node` when used ideally, it makes more sense for it to be in `common` based on the way it is used now.\r\n\r\nMore generally, I do think it's good for public node types to be defined in the node library, even if they may be also used by outside code (such as as GUI code or code in src/interfaces/ or src/common/). It makes the outside code clearer and more self documenting if you can see which libraries types are coming from. CNodeStats, CNodeStateStats, and SynchronizationState are examples of other node types which are used by the GUI outside  the node library. AddressPurpose, isminetype, CRecipient, and CCoinControl are examples of wallet types used by the GUI outside the wallet library, and I think in both cases it is helpful for these types to have node:: and wallet:: prefixes when used by outside code.\r\n\r\nBut this is just to explain my reasoning. I wouldn't oppose moving the type to common if you think that is better. I will also look into splitting up the TransactionError type to see if there's an easy way to clean this up completely.",

I wasn't expecting paragraphs of response :)\r\n\r\nYeah sorry thanks for pinning down the actual concern. Before you just said it \"seems odd\" so I felt like I needed to justify my entire thought process.\r\n\r\nIn any case, both the node and wallet libraries expose public types which I listed above (CNodeStats, CNodeStateStats, and SynchronizationState, AddressPurpose, isminetype, CRecipient, and CCoinControl) which can be considered part of the interfaces to these libraries, but are not part of the libraries themselves. For example, the GUI code is not allowed to call node or wallet functions, but it uses all of these public types, and this is fine. Other code, including code in common, can also use these types and there is no problem with this.\r\n\r\nWe do have a choice where about where to put public types which are not really part of any library. We can put them in the interfaces directory, or in common, or in the node and wallet directories. Personally, I think it makes sense to put them in the wallet directory when they are related to wallet functionality and used by wallet code, put them in the node directory when they are related to node functionality and used by node code, put them in the common directory when they are related to common functionality (like PSBT) and used by common code. The comments at the top of {node,wallet,common}/types.h files are meant to explain the idea that these are public types.\r\n\r\n> Doesn't really seem worth worrying about the fact that some of the errors only make sense in a node context; aren't these all just \"something went wrong, deal with it, dear user\"?\r\n\r\nYes if errors are just being propagated to the user level, you don't care about this at all, and it's probably a mistake to use an enum to begin with because the error messages won't be able to contain useful context. In this case, though, the errors are being translated to RPC codes, and RPC callers may actually want to implement different forms of error handling, so it would be good to be clear about what errors are possible, plus it's easy to do, so I did add a new commit splitting PSBTError from TransactionError.\r\n\r\n> BTW, I think `TransactionError::P2P_DISABLED` can be dropped entirely? (I think the last/only use was removed in #15713)\r\n\r\nThanks, the new commit drops this code too.",
