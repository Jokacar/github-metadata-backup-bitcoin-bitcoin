    "body": "Opening for discussion / conceptual review.\r\n\r\nWe like the idea of a smaller maximum transaction size because:\r\n- It lowers potential replacement cost (i.e. harder to do Rule 3 pinning via gigantic transaction)\r\n- They are easier to bin-pack in block template production\r\n- They equate to a tighter memory limit in data structures that are bounded by a number of transactions (e.g. orphanage and vExtraTxnForCompact). For example, the current memory bounds for orphanage is 100KvB * 100 = 40MB, and guaranteeing 1 tx per peer would require reserving a pretty large space.\r\n\r\nLowering `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT` for all txns is not being proposed, as there are existing apps/protocols that rely on large transactions. However, it's been brought up that we should consider this for TRUCs (which is especially designed to avoid Rule 3 pinning).\r\n\r\nThis reduction to 25k should be ok because:\r\n- [Expected size of a commitment transaction](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md#expected-weight-of-the-commitment-transaction) is within (900 + 172 * 483 + 224) / 4 = 21050vB\r\n- v3 isn't standard yet, so this wouldn't break somebody's existing use case. If we find that this is too small, we can always increase it later. Decreasing would be much more difficult.\r\n\r\nQuestions we'd want to consider\r\n- Would this make things {broken, inconvenient} for potential users of TRUCs, e.g. by requiring swapping between v3 and v2?\r\n- Is this useful for pinning, given that there are already tighter limits on commitment tx size through `max_accepted_htlcs`?",

Maybe in the long run the network moves towards a lower cap on transaction sizes and this can be a way to test the waters; on the other hand, if we get this wrong and there is demand for bigger TRUC transactions for some use case, we can always relax the limit later if we need to.",

This would also help us avoid future potential issues with signedness of this value.\r\n\r\nI believe that this is safe and does not actually change what transactions would or would not be considered both standard and consensus valid. Within consensus, the only use of the version in consensus is in BIP68 validation which was already casting it to uint32_t. Within policy, although it is used as a signed int for the transaction version number check, I do not think that this change would change standardness. Standard transactions are limited to the range [1, 2]. Negative numbers would have fallen under the < 1 condition, but by making it unsigned, they are still non-standard under the > 2 condition.\r\n\r\nUnsigned and signed ints are serialized and unserialized the same way so there is no change in serialization.",

But we will likely need to transmit more data when we support PTLCs, which means we'll probably reduce the maximum number of allowed PTLCs (IIRC we'll have to divide the current limits roughly by two). That would reduce the maximum size of a commitment transaction, which is IMO a good thing and would likely work with your proposed maximum of 25KvB!\r\n\r\nRegardless of that, I think you shouldn't care about the size of today's lightning transactions: whenever we start using TRUCs, we can cut down the maximum number of allowed HTLCs to ensure that the transaction size stays below 25KvB. Lightning should adapt to what's best for bitcoin more generally, and I agree that smaller transactions are desirable.",
