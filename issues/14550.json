To that support goal, I'd like a \"start minimized\" option in your settings area, and it might be useful to keep the existing state between runs (after system shuts down) as an alternative \"no extra user work required\" version.  Versus needing them to dig in dialogs to find this setting when they likely want to not be bothered by your app if they'd minimized it before.  I'm on Windows 10, 64 bit if that matters.",

Then a short time later I see the sync dialog that I must minimize again to ACTUALLY minimize the app.  The initial dialog's current state should be propagated to any further dialogs that happen during startup.\r\n\r\nHave seen this issue for a long time, like years, and wouldn't be surprised if related to another bug I saw mentioning a Qt minimize issue.  But they didn't seem to mention the behavior I'm seeing, so opening another bug.  Note that the other issue has been open for 2 years which is pretty sad for a UI bug that sounds pretty simple/basic.\r\n\r\nI have Hide tray icon off, minimize to tray instead of the taskbar on (which doesn't work), and minimize on close off.  I'm running on Windows 10 with all released updates.  Have been periodically upgrading but on v0.16.1 64 bit currently (always been 64 bit...maybe that is the issue?)  Think I saw this on 0.14.x at least if not earlier.",
