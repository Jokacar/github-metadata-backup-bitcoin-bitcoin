    "body": "Moving the discussion from #15798 here, as it makes more sense to have it in an issue instead of a PR. #15798 no longer reflects the current proposed Rust changes, and Rust related work is now happening across multiple others.\r\n\r\n[Corys](https://github.com/theuni/) thoughts / introduction from #15798:\r\n\r\n> This is not intended to be merged as-is, but instead to serve as a reference for anyone who might be interested in trying out some rust code inside of Bitcoin Core. I have no idea what works. I have lots of questions about debugging, threading, etc. But instead of trying to hack and document how things work, we thought it'd be fun for everyone to be able to poke at it and scratch our heads together :). If something interesting comes out of it, a discussion about merging can happen then.\r\n\r\n> It is surprisingly functional. The rust tools are impeccable. I would've thought this would be a project that would take months/years, but the rust devs have done such a good job that mostly everything already just works. The gitian descriptors have been modified to actually incorporate working rust code. All of our currently supported platforms seem to already work (even macOS cross!) with the exception of 32bit windows and ancient linux distros. The specific issues are documented in the gitian descriptors. For now, Gitian needs net access and a larger disk volume, but those are both very temporary issues\r\n\r\n> Why rust? I don't know. Maybe not. But I think it's a fair assumption to say that Rust code will eventually end up in Bitcoin Core as the result of adding a new dependency. Adoption is happing quickly. So, I think it prudent to look ahead and not only be prepared, but actively help usher it in. Already I have a few things that I would like to work on and upstream to rust-lang to make our integration nicer, and I assume that more will be uncovered as it actually gets used.\r\n\r\n> Anybody have any fun ideas?\r\n\r\nThere's still discussion to be had / documentation to be added around various Rust related decisions, such as:\r\n* Whether to use/require the `2015` or `2018` Editions.\r\n* A minimum required version of the language.\r\n* How failures in the Rust code are (expected to be) handled by the c++ code.\r\n\r\nAs well as higher level discussions around how far we might take the Rust integration/re-writing of certain parts of the code, and the complexities that could introduce in regards which contributors can/can't write/review Rust, or have more/less experience with the language compared to `C++` etc.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd like to think that we'll have some off-by-default Rust as part of the Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 release; and I think something like #16834 might be a good first approach. Regardless of approach, the idea of using Rust inside Bitcoin Core seems to resonate with some of the (still limited set) of other contributors I've discussed it with.\r\n\r\n#### Using `rustc` directly instead of Cargo\r\nThe initial Rust [integration PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15798) used [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo) for managing compiling, dependencies etc. Since then, the Rust changes have been refactored to remove the `cbindgen` dependency and drop any usage of Cargo altogether, in favour of using [`rustc` directly](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16834/files#diff-480477e89f9b6ddafb30c4383dcdd705R371).\r\n\r\nSee also the recent [Security advisory for Cargo](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/09/30/Security-advisory-for-cargo.html).\r\n\r\n#### Related PRs\r\n[Fetch Headers over DNS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16834)\r\n[Rust-based Backup over-REST block downloader](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16762)\r\n[Add Parallel P2P Client in Rust](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17376)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Related Reading\r\n[Bootstrapping Rust using Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2018/bootstrapping-rust/)",

I think its nice cause it is completely optional, both at build-time, and in the sense that we can have threads that are doing that crash (without bringing down the rest of Core due to panic catches) without it making the rest of Core broken.\r\n * I think we should air towards \"minimum version of the language we can get by with\" until we have a reason not to, and we can discuss it more then. Largely, I think #16834 is ready-to-go enough (mod review) that we can pretty much move forward with it without committing to a lot of these decisions today.\r\n * WRT cargo-vs-rustc: I don't see a lot of reason to use cargo. The major benefit it provides is downloading arbitrary code from github, building it, and linking it into your program. Obviously this isn't helpful for us, and we'll almost certainly subtree any dependencies we take, and I went and tested linking dependencies that are subtree'd without cargo and its just a few more flags to rustc.",

However, this is a chicken-and-egg problem and can be solved by adding rust in small steps.\r\n\r\nFinally, a concern was that we aren't running into many bugs that rust could prevent. Rust can prevent memory and race issues, but not logic errors. While I initially agreed with this point, I concluded that switching to rust will help us with memory issues (at least for the code written in rust). Just to dig up some examples from master, that would have been impossible in rust: #6636, #16796, #13351. Happy to dig out more, but I think they are good illustrations. On top of that, I (and other people, such as a resident in the recent Chaincode Summer residency) am running into segfaults and other memory issues on a regular basis. Those runtime errors require a lot of developer attention (running in gdb, valgrind, sanitizers). Rust makes them impossible and might thus speed up the workflow.",

We've been extremely careful around introducing concurrency, for example, or refactoring it to be finer-grained (e.g. @TheBlueMatt's PRs are just so scary to review), because it's so hard to get correct in C++.

Rust can prevent memory and race issues, but not logic errors.\r\n\r\nFWIW, a small scale bug shootout:\r\n* [Issues found in the Rust Miniscript implementation](https://github.com/apoelstra/rust-miniscript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Apracticalswift+)\r\n* [Issues found in the C++ Miniscript implementation](https://github.com/sipa/miniscript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Apracticalswift+)\r\n\r\nBoth implementations written by extremely skilled and security conscious developers :)\r\n\r\n@laanwj \r\n\r\n> I've been very much disillusioned with C++ over the last years, especially the eternal issues around what is Undefined Behavior and what is not (just grep for commits and PRs by @practicalswift to find tons of them).\r\n\r\nThree points:\r\n\r\n1. The UB situation in C++ is a problematic, but with some help from the sanitizers (which we are finally using!) it is not too hard to avoid relying on UB in modern C++ code. FWIW, poorly written unsafe Rust code will have UB too :)\r\n2. Usually it is pretty clear if something is UB or not. Any discussion is typically around the priority of fixing, and/or if relying on the specific UB is \"safe in practice\" (in other words: what is the likelihood of a future compiler optimisation pass exploiting this specific UB?).\r\n3. As always when discussing defects: don't shoot the messenger :)\r\n\r\nFWIW I don't think UB is a big problem in our code base as of today. I think our lack of continuous large-scale fuzz testing is a larger problem - something which I plan to address :)",

      "body": "I agree with most of what was said here with a few exceptions:\r\n\r\n1. Even though I don't know of any security critical bug bitcoin had that was memory related I think in the long term rust can help a lot with both review time and implementation time. \r\nBecause right now when someone opens a PR with a function that for example accepts a raw pointer part of the review is to look everywhere that function is used and make sure there's no way to  get to a dangling pointer or to accidentally dereference a null pointer. \r\nAll of these problems are no-ops in safe rust. so even if currently the bitcoin review process is good at eliminating most of these problems Rust can help save review time.\r\n\r\n2. Personally and I'll guess for other non C++ experts, writing C++ sometimes feel scary because you're not 100% there's no UB in your code and there's not some edge case with memory issue, this problem is mitigated with sanitizers, valgrind and good review process. but it's better to *know* your code does what you think it does. (again this is only about memory un-clearity not logic)\r\n\r\nNow about rust itself:\r\n\r\n1. I think that if we plan to make this experimental and optional for a while i'll go for the latest rust compiler available right now. because when and if it will ever be an inherit part of bitcoin `mrustc` will probably support newer versions(already at the verge of 1.29 support[1] ) and maybe even a gcc frontend will arise by then[2]\r\n\r\n2. I do understand the idea of not requiring any version newer than what is shipped with latest distros, but I think that any safety feature we'll miss because of \"supporting the oldest compiler possible\" will make us miss the entire point of using rust.\r\n\r\n3. I see no point in using Edition 2015, as Edition 2018 was stabilized in Rust 1.31. That said this is only an esthetic change, so I don't have strong feelings about it.\r\n\r\n4. Cargo vs. rustc. I think that as long as we can get away with using rustc directly it's fine, but I don't think this will work for the long term. \r\n\r\n5. Combining point 4 and 1, I think that when we will want cargo and when we will have dependencies then we will want a feature like `cargo vendor` which was added to cargo in 1.37 so that's another reason for using an up to date rust version. on top of that the mentioned security advisory(I found btw) is an example on why it's problematic to use old versions of fast evolving tools. I hope the rust and cargo team will learn from that experience for future features but I would argue that we should try and use an up to date rust version.\r\n\r\nQuick simple example of dependencies we will want to use if we continue to integrate rust is `cbindgen` and `rust-bindgen` as FFI calling is a very easy way to introduce UB that no compiler will warn about (if the rust and C declarations won't match correctly).\r\n\r\nP.S. If people want I can try and give a list of examples of features we might need that aren't available in old rustc versions. and that's without talking about changes to the borrow checker that makes writing rust code way easier.\r\n\r\n[1]  https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc/issues/95#issuecomment-538747289\r\n[2] https://users.rust-lang.org/t/call-for-help-implementing-an-independent-rust-frontend-for-gcc/32163",

      "body": "## An Ode To Simplicity\r\n\r\nRather infamously, in a recent talk, a developer related the story of a manager who chose to reward programmers based on LOC committed.  One engineer responded by making an extra effort to go through the company's codebase and delete code, ensuring they would rank at the very bottom of the chart, with _negative_ LOC each month.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of must-be-secure high quality code, less is more.   Less code probablistically produces fewer bugs, fewer LOC to review and analyze, and is easier to prove secure.\r\n\r\nThis was the origin of the `--disable-wallet` compile time flag.  This permits eliding GUI and wallet code, focusing on the network-security-sensitive kernel as the minimized runtime attack surface for validating nodes.\r\n\r\nIntegrating two languages tends to go in the opposite direction from complexity reduction.  FFI and unsafe rust and hidden sand traps galore.  It takes another 10 years to move the C++/Rust boundary to 75+% rust.\r\n\r\nTrying to take a step back and think holistically,\r\n\r\n1. There is a numerically large userbase for \"the kernel\" - the network validating engine - and numerically small userbase for the GUI and wallet.\r\n2. The kernel should be in a repo by itself, without a kitchen sink of other code such as wallet or GUI.  Those accessories can live in git repos that use the kernel repo as a submodule.  This creates incentives for the kernel repo (and issues and workflow) become more simple, less complex over time.\r\n3. Build a separate, safe Rust validating engine.  Run in parallel with C++ to observe A/B differences in field operation.\r\n4. Migrate wallet/GUI to use REST/zmq/etc. interfaces.\r\n5. At this point, switch to Rust engine can safely be done.\r\n\r\nEnd result in medium term is a less complex core.\r\nEnd result in longer term is less complex core... in Rust.\r\n",

If we end up needing something more, we can revisit then, but as an initial target it should do (probably implies we need to test it in Travis in #16834).\r\n * No direct conclusion on rustc-vs-cargo, but for now I don't see any strong disagreement to move forward with rustc and be willing to revisit in the future.\r\n * Be willing to ship on-in-release-binaries immediately in 0.20, using gitian/Canonical's rustc as it doesn't (massively) change our trust model within Gitian of trusting the Canonical toolchain, instead of gating on the ongoing Guix work. Note that this (obviously) will result in release builds using a newer rustc than our \"minimum supported\".\r\n * No significant objection to moving forward here!",

Prefer linting to happen during the regular local build/testing though rather than just in Travis, and think that we should have tooling which makes it simple to emit bindings to be committed to keep development flow simple. We should also be careful to not allow bindings which *aren't* generatable from CBindgen, so even if we aren't relying on it for build we can be sure it's in line with what could be machine generated.",

While this isn't very useful on its own, its a somewhat cool demo of how low the review burden could be to add new fetch methods in Rust code, and could be a useful to know whether we're behind (eg for stale tip checking). You can test with -headersfetchdns=headers.bitcoinheaders.net which is served from a standard bind named with the following generation scripts:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor I in {0..100}; do\r\n\techo \"\" >

          "body": "> _This is a Bisq Network proposal. Please familiarize yourself with the [submission and review process](https://docs.bisq.network/proposals.html)._\r\n\r\n<!-- Please do not remove the text above. -->\r\n\r\n# Suggestion\r\n\r\nI would like to put forward the possibility of implementing Bisq v2 from scratch in a different language.\r\n\r\n## Major Triggers\r\n\r\nThe following major issues triggered me to even consider this:\r\n- A major feature of the [Bisq V2](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/118) proposal is the [off-chain trade protocol](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/32). It is very likely that off-chain trading will not be backwards compatible. Large parts of the code base will require re-implementing and there will be a hard-fork of the trade protocol. Of the code that doesn't require completely re-writting there will also have to be changes further reducing the amount of code that will be uneffected.\r\n- The current state of the code base has a lot of technical debt. Lots of the code is hard to understand and could benefit from refactoring. But it is unlikely that this will occur because almost no one is able to review significant changes, especially to the most critical code. Due to the amount of internal coupling almost every change has the potential to effect something critical.\r\n- The most important dependency of bisq (BitcoinJ) is unmaintained and untrustworthy. There is no alternative in the JVM ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThere are many other minor things that led me to consider this but they are dwarfed by the above mentioned major ones.\r\n\r\n## Feasibility\r\n\r\nSince a rewrite in a different language is a major undertaking that shouldn't be taken on lightly (even with the presence of the major triggers) much more information is required to analyse the trade-offs. For this purpose I have done a feasibility study to shed some light on the following questions:\r\n\r\n- is an alternative implementation that is compatible with the live p2p network possible (ie. can java <-> rust processes communicate correctly via the protobuf based protocol)?\r\n- are there any significant technical advantages that can be gained from taking this approach (eg. less overall complexity, less risky dependencies, better dev workflow etc.)?\r\n- how high would the remaining effort be to achieve production rediness with an alternative implementation?\r\n- does it make sense as a strategic approach to write V2 from scratch vs adapt the existing code?\r\n\r\nYou can find the code for the proof-of-concept of re-implementing bisq in rust here: https://github.com/bodymindarts/risq\r\n\r\n## POC findings\r\n\r\nAs a result of the proof-of-concept I have come to the conclusion that there are indeed many potential benefits by re-implementing bisq in rust (as part of V2). Enough that it is worth putting forward this proposal for serious consideration.\r\n\r\n- Backwards compatibility on the p2p layer is no problem (trade layer would be a hard fork anyway).\r\n- Significant reduction of overall complexity and LOC (imo at least 50% less code) is realistic.\r\n- better dev-workflow (ie. rust eco-system is much more dev-friendly. It is less verbose has faster build times and more powerful type system that reduces the potential for errors).\r\n- api/cli-first implementation opens up potential for many extensions/integrations. Integrating an API into the current Bisq code base is a significant challenge. This should be a consideration from day 1.\r\n- There is strong support for rust based implementations in the bitcoin eco system maintained by respectable devs with long track-records.\r\n- (...)\r\n\r\n## Next steps\r\n\r\nWith more information regarding feasibility available due to the proof-of-concept I believe an informed public discussion is now possible. Obviously how to move forward will depend a lot on the outcome of this discussion so the next steps I am laying out are not to be taken as recommendation. Rather a starting point for consideration.\r\n\r\nTo move forward with the (hypothetical) project Bisq V2 in rust (pending community discussions) the following steps would likely need to occur:\r\n- consider wether the project could be a candidate for inclusion in the [incubator-space](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/122)\r\n- consider wether delivery would be stand-alone (a completely new app with download etc) or integrated into the current artifact.\r\n- consider the boundries in terms of functionality for the new and legacy implementation. The most critical part of the existing code is the DAO. Perhaps the existing code could be stripped down to a kind of bisq-governance app (rather than risking an issue during re-implementation) in order to keep Bisq V2 focused on the off-chain trading (since that is the part that needs re-writting anyway).\r\n- lots of other stuff that will hopefully emerge from the following discussion",

      "body": "I made a branch where I replaced `GetRandBytes` and `GetStrongRandBytes` with Rust's [rand library](https://docs.rs/crate/rand/0.7.2), using its `thread_rng` CSPRNG. This would optionally replace Bitcoin Core's current custom RNG implementation with the goal of simplifying the overall randomness pipeline. The thread safety is handled by rand so no extra mutexes are required along with the initialisation of an RNG per thread and its seeding using OS randomness. This branch builds off [Cory's PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15798) because it requires Cargo to download and build the rand dependency. If there's interest in this concept of RNG in Rust I'll send up the branch as a PR. \r\n\r\nThe branch:\r\nhttps://github.com/metalicjames/bitcoin/tree/rust_csprng\r\nThe diff:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...metalicjames:rust_csprng?expand=1\r\nThe rand lib from Rust:\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-random/rand",

Introducing Rust to Core is an investment though in that young ecosystem.\r\n\r\n@TheBlueMatt is engaging with the Rust community which is great and we certainly need people like Matt to do this to ensure Rust continues to be attractive to Core. Concerns that he highlights [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/do6a5v/warning_floods_make_rust_impossible_to_use/f5kernl/) don't impact the Core PRs.\r\n\r\nLonger term, there could be a Rust-like language created in future that capitalizes on some of Rust’s strengths but doesn’t make mistakes with regards to design and community decision pitfalls that every language is in danger of making. \r\n\r\nIn that case would we be happy having C++, Rust and this future language in Core? Would we look into replacing Rust code with this new language? As we go further down this road do we become more and more tied to Rust at this early stage in its life cycle? Should Core be a (relatively) early adopter of new languages?\r\n\r\n> it's a fair assumption to say that Rust code will eventually end up in Bitcoin Core as the result of adding a new dependency\r\n\r\nI’m not convinced this is inevitable. Using this inevitability as an argument to introduce Rust into Core seems like a flimsy argument to me. If we really wanted to we could avoid Rust dependencies.\r\n",

Also, I like the approach Tor uses to [vendor](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/doc/HACKING/GettingStartedRust.md#n67) the cargo dependencies in a separate repo.\r\n\r\n@michaelfolkson recently there was an [email](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wipXqemHbVnK1kQsFzGOOZ8FUXn3PKrZb5WC=KkgAjRRw@mail.gmail.com/) recently for Linux Kernel in-tree support for Rust.  To me this is a signal that Rust has matured to the point that if the linux kernel is considering support, so might other projects regardless of what the _next_ language after Rust might be.",

          "title": "[POC] Rust based Cuckoo Filter for m_addr_known",
          "body": "This proof of concept PR (leveraging work done by Cory Fields & Jeremy Rubin, see #16834) replaces the [rolling bloom filter](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2448457cca1858c2fcf3dfcb53de3f388ea72079/src/bloom.cpp#L173) used for [`m_addr_known`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2448457cca1858c2fcf3dfcb53de3f388ea72079/src/net.h#L550) with a [Cuckoo Filter written in Rust](https://github.com/axiomhq/rust-cuckoofilter). I've have made some minor build related adjustments to the Rust code, which can be seen here: https://github.com/fanquake/rust-cuckoofilter/tree/cabi_build_adjustments.\r\n\r\nSee [\"Cuckoo Filter: Practically Better Than Bloom\"](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/cuckoo-conext2014.pdf):\r\n\r\n> In many networking systems, Bloom filters are used for high-speed set membership tests. They permit a small fraction of false positive answers with very good space efficiency. However, they do not permit deletion of items from the set, and previous attempts to extend “standard” Bloom filters to support deletion all degrade either space or performance.\r\n\r\n> We propose a new data structure called the cuckoo filter that can replace Bloom filters for approximate set member- ship tests. Cuckoo filters support adding and removing items dynamically while achieving even higher performance than Bloom filters. \r\n\r\n> For applications that store many items and target moderately low false positive rates, cuckoo filters have lower space overhead than space-optimized Bloom filters. Our experimental results also show that cuckoo filters out-perform previous data structures that extend Bloom filters to support deletions substantially in both time and space.\r\n\r\nUsing this is a matter of:\r\n```bash\r\n./autogen.sh\r\n./configure --enable-experimental-rust\r\nmake\r\nmake -C src rusty-check\r\nsrc/bitcoind \r\n```\r\nNote that sometimes compilation will finish (i.e due to `ccache`) before `cargo` has finished generating the header and Rust lib, which will result in a compile error:\r\n```bash\r\n./net.h:43:10: fatal error: rusty/out/rcf_cuckoofilter.h: No such file or directory\r\n   43 | #include <rusty/out/rcf_cuckoofilter.h>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case you can just re-run `make`. Has been tested on macOS and Linux. Sometimes `p2p_getaddr_caching.py` fails, because the number of records returned falls a few short of `MAX_ADDR_TO_SEND`. Need investigating.\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting that this be merged as-is, or that this is the ideal way of integrating Rust code (i.e copying sources in tree, using `cbindgen`), into Bitcoin Core. What I am suggesting is that the Rust discussion should continue, particularly in regards to integrations that can be done in a very non-invasive / modular fashion.\r\n\r\nDoesn't crash, but may catch your machine on fire 🔥, use with caution. More Rust related discussion available in #17090.",

      "body": "IMO, Mixing C++ and Rust code is just a bad idea, that will just slow down everyone involved. As a primarily Rust developer, I don't want to be touching C++. And I can't blame a C++ developer for not wanting to touch Rust either. Why force devs into a bad marriage that a lot of existing and potential new contributors will not be really happy with anyway?\r\n\r\nEven though C++ and Rust are superficially similar, about everything about [actually working with them is different](https://www.reddit.com/r/rustjerk/comments/ohf2rr/code_review/). The way you structure your program, the way you build your APIs, the way you review code. These two will not mix well.\r\n\r\nLinux kernel example is not a good example because it is integrating C and not C++ with Rust, and there is no alternative practical approach other than mixing them, and they have good clear boundaries (driver layer, for now at least) at which they can build APIs around. In case of Bitcoin Core there is a better alternative: the network consensus layer.\r\n\r\nI know that the dogma historically has been that having multiple client implementations is a bad idea, but I personally never agreed with the reasoning there. Having single vs multiple implementations doesn't have a simple binary answer. It has benefits (like overall ecosystem robustness) and drawbacks (like having to do the same work twice, making coordination harder (tell miners to stick with one implementation to avoid chain splits!, etc.)). Think what you will about it, but now there's actually an additional reason to make an exception even if someone thinks in general it's not a best situation. \r\n\r\nEffectively `rust-bitcoin` is already building alternative implementation of chunks of Bitcoin Core for larger ecosystem. Bitcoin Core is not impossibly huge body of software, and is also not one known for changing at some rapid pace. There has even already been an [alternative Rust implementation](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-bitcoin/) (like it or not :D). Lowest level primitives can be (and are already) reused between C++ and Rust. And rewriting stuff in Rust is just a fun thing to do. \r\n\r\nWhat's needed here is a general agreement that yes, this is a course of action that larger developer Bitcoin community will generally support (preferred to forcing all core developers into a  Rust++ marriage inside one codebase) and enough commitment from people and organizations that can and want to actually work on it. I mean - if there isn't enough people that want it, then why bother having this github issue open in the first place - clearly there's not enough interest, at least yet. Once people more enthusiastic about Rust can actually deliver something, figure out all the relevant details, we can compare the results, benchmark, judge the codebase, community interest, etc. Maybe support both codebases for decades to come, maybe phase out one that is clearly not having traction anymore, maybe something else entirely because situation changed.",
