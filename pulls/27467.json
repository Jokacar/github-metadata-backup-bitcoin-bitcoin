We’d only open a persistent outbound connection to peers which have a different netgroup compared to those netgroups present in `setConnected`.\r\n\r\nCurrent `GetGroup()` logic assumes route-based diversification behaviour for tor/i2p/cjdns addresses (addresses are public key based and not route-based). Distinct netgroups possible (according to the current `GetGroup()` logic) for:\r\n1. tor => 030f, 031f, .. 03ff (16 possibilities)\r\n2. i2p => 040f, 041f, .. 04ff (16 possibilities)\r\n3. cjdns => 05fc0f, 05fc1f, ... 05fcff (16 possibilities)\r\n\r\n`setConnected` is used in `ThreadOpenConnections()` before making [outbound](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/84f4ac39fda7ffa5dc84e92d92dd1eeeb5e20f8c/src/net.cpp#L1846) and [anchor](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/84f4ac39fda7ffa5dc84e92d92dd1eeeb5e20f8c/src/net.cpp#L1805) connections to new peers so that they belong to distinct netgroups.\r\n\r\n**behaviour on master**\r\n\r\n- if we run a node only on tor/i2p/cjdns\r\n\t- we wouldn't be able to open more than 16 outbound connections(manual, block-relay-only anchor, outbound full relay, block-relay-only connections) because we run out of possible netgroups.\r\n\t- see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27264#issuecomment-1481322628\r\n\t- tested by changing `MAX_OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY_CONNECTIONS` to 17 with `onlynet=onion` and observed how node wouldn't make more than 16 outbound connections.\r\n\r\n**behaviour on PR**\r\n\r\n- netgroup diversity checks are skipped for tor/i2p/cjdns addresses. \r\n- we don't insert tor/i2p/cjdns address in `setConnected` and `GetGroup` doesn't get called on tor/i2p/cjdns(see #27369)\r\n",

          "body": "To improve privacy, relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for relaying sensitive data (our own transactions) with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local unbroadcast transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer and the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed\r\n\r\n* Relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers.\r\n\r\n* Hide those transactions from `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` requests, as if we don't have them.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, request the transaction with `GETDATA`, as if we didn't have it before.\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the unbroadcast list.\r\n\r\n* `INV` it to others as a result of the `TX` message we get, like what we do with transactions that are not ours.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new local transaction is received (from the wallet or RPC), the node will send it to 5 (`SENSITIVE_RELAY_NUM_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 5 more peers (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptInitialBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived sensitive relay connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers will blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [x] Disable if `-connect` is used or Tor and I2P are not reachable.\r\n* [x] Use I2P transient connections even if listening on I2P.\r\n* [x] Do something with the user-agent string (could reveal identity if it has been personalized) and make sure no identifying information in the `VERSION` message. Done: took the [suggestion below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#issuecomment-1517896418).\r\n* [x] Improve the condition when we consider the transaction seen by the network: right now a single INV from somebody suffices (this is still an improvement over `master` which is ok right after pushing the tx to a peer). We could wait for more than one INV, from peers that we have selected (outbound) and that are specifically not the ones we broadcasted to (via short-lived connection). Edit: One `INV` should be enough because after that we broadcast the transaction to everybody we are connected to (like if it is not ours).\r\n* [ ] Idea: start with one connection per transaction (not 5 as it is now), optimistically assuming it will be sufficient. (numbers are examples) After 1 minute, if still not received from the network, try 2 connections, after a few minutes try more. If still unsuccessful after 10 minutes, then fall back to the old mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to address:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450\r\n",

This increases privacy and will also make it harder to perform fingerprinting attacks (connecting our identities over different networks).\r\n\r\nManual Block-Relay connections:\r\n- can be specified with `-addnode` RPC, both with the `add` and `onetry` command\r\n- can be specified with the `-addnode` bitcoind arg (or in bitcoin.conf) with `<IP>=manual-block-relay`\r\n- don't participate in transaction and address relay\r\n- don't get discouraged / punished for misbehavior (but will still get disconnected for sending TX/tx-INV as automatic block-relay-only peers do)\r\n- are not subject to outbound eviction logic (unlike automatic block-relay-only-peers)\r\n",

If a PR has sufficient review and no substantive technical objections, it should be merged regardless of these comments.\r\n\r\nBut I think these comments are really valuable for helping people decide what to spend time on, and I personally want to encourage more not less \"I don't think this PR is useful\" comments. Sometimes a PR is more useful than it initially appears, and more discussion could help clarify that. Other times, maybe the PR is not really very useful, and having the feedback could help the contributor decide not to put more work into the PR, and avoid having them wonder for months if the PR isn't getting review because it isn't interesting, or is too hard to understand, or just wasn't noticed.\r\n",

      "body": "Per the first line of the diff and the first line of the PR description, a well-named data structure is preferable to one with an out-of-date name that needs a comment to explain what it now does after its role changed.  Our p2p code is sufficiently critical for this to be important, and for that reason we often see review comments requesting clearer naming in p2p changes.\r\n\r\nI think the canned response in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27467#issuecomment-1521500955, and its use, is problematic.  Many commits are merged that change naming for style reasons only, or even do nothing but change indentation, clean up code, change or drop a word, etc. Here, we have a data structure that changed its role, which seems as good a reason as can be to update the naming in order to make sense and not be a footgun for developers or source of confusion. Coming down on renaming when the semantics changed out from under a data structure, but being fine with PRs containing several renaming commits for style reasons only, is a little baroque.  ACKing and merging changes that would fall under that canned response, while punching down on as-valid-or-more other ones inevitably looks arbitrary, hypocritical or favoritist.  A rule or canned response, like the developer notes, ought to be applied consistently or not at all. This particular one is too wide in interpretation and subjective in practice, so when it’s not misapplied, it is at best arbitrary and unhelpful, and at worst is disruptive or negative social signaling that shouldn't be done. For these reasons, my suggestion would be to bin that canned response and not use it at all.\r\n\r\nLet's please encourage review, including post-merge review and occasional fixups that may come from that.  If there's one thing that is perennially desired on this project, it's more eyes on the code and helpful, positive, complementary reviewers to move things forward. As long as a reviewer is well-intentioned and trying to help Bitcoin, let's encourage them with kindness, indulgence and wisdom. Thanks!\r\n",

If anything, it was much more misleading before #27343 when there was no comment, because the name `setConnected` doesn't imply \"netgroups of outbound peers from all networks\" any more than it implies \"netgroups of ipv4/ipv6 outbound peers\" - after all we are \"connected\" to inbound peers too.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not against renaming.",
