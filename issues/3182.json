    "title": "OSX Maverick \"App Nap\" slowdown",
    "body": "Reported via email:\n\nThe only issue I've come across period, isn't really a problem. But it is confusing to someone downloading Bitcoin-Qt unaware of OS X Maverick's under the surface options. When I first opened it up and set if off downloading the blockchain I thought there was a problem as it was doing it incredibly slow. Much slower than usual. And when I clicked on the battery icon at the top of the screen, there's a new feature in Mavericks which lets you know of \"Apps Using Significant Energy\". When Chrome was the only app that appeared I realized something was wrong.\n\nI had a bit of knowledge about a new feature in Mavericks called App Nap and I had a hunch it was something to do with that. It was. App Nap is a new feature designed for optimizing battery life that puts background/non-visible apps with no audio, video or otherwise relevant to current usage, to sleep. So whenever I was browsing in Chrome, Qt was fully napping. I have since read that there's a full App Nap API for developers to take advantage of to tweak which parts or aspects of an app can or can't be put to sleep, or turn off napping of the app full stop; so devs have control over this feature, but it is enabled by default.\n\nUntil then, I figured out a simple way to turn off app napping on the user's side with any app as well. You can right click any app, click Get Info, and at the top there's a new checkbox named Prevent App Nap. I imagine this is useful to anyone, or yourself, using Qt on Mavericks as doing anything without it seems to completely stop Qt from synchronising with the blockchain.\n",

          "body": "I've run bitcoin-qt Mac client on the latest OSX version since 0.3.x thru to 0.7.2 with literally zero problems ever, on essentially this same hardware setup.\n\nSince the 0.8 update and switch to LevelDB none of the three Mac client releases have worked stably for me and I've had to downgrade to 0.7.2 (with the May 15 workaround) to maintain a stable bitcoin wallet.\n\nCurrent setup is: MacBook Pro Retina, OSX 10.8.4, bitcoin-qt 0.8.2\n\nI saw that some of the known corruption issues/bugs were fixed/closed with the 0.8.2 release, so I decided to try the upgrade again.  After re-indexing and working fine for hours at time (much better than 0.8.1 at least) upon restart I get \"Error opening block database. Do you want to rebuild the block database?\" which of course I don't want to do because it takes forever, even on this world's fastest Mac with SSD drive.  This has happened 6 times now, and the interesting line in debug.log is:\n\nVerifying last 288 blocks at level 3\nLevelDB read failure: Corruption: block checksum mismatch\n\nMore details here:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155140.0\n\nDowngrading to 0.7.2 again, please help permanently fix this in the next 0.8.x release.\n",

Keeping the app in foreground will obviously avoid the App Nap mode. At the moment it is even impossible to disable per-app Nap Mode via the Get Info dialog because there is no option to do that with the Bitcoin client app.\r\n\r\nThe App Nap issue was already addressed and solved in few previous ticket (#3182, #5041, #5804).\r\n\r\nI don't really know how App Nap can interfere with the client performance, at the moment i'm syncing the whole blockchain and it's taking a lot.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-12-14 at 10 59 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/385030/33986928-6cd532a2-e0bf-11e7-8723-1850cfa56142.png)\r\n\r\n",
