    "body": "The `MANDATORY_SCRIPT_VERIFY_FLAGS` constant was introduced in #3843 to distinguish between block consensus rules and relay standardness rules. However it was not actually used in the consensus code path: instead it only differentiates between the failure being reported as `TX_CONSENSUS` and `mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed` vs `TX_NOT_STANDARD` and `non-mandatory-script-verify-flag`.\r\n\r\nThis updates the list of mandatory flags to include the post-p2sh soft forks that are enforced as consensus rules via `GetBlockScriptFlags()`. The effect of this change is that validation.cpp will report `TX_CONSENSUS` failures for txs that fail dersig/csv/cltv/nulldummy/witness/taproot checks, instead of `TX_NOT_STANDARD`, which in turn adds `Misbehaving(100)` via `MaybePunishNodeForTx` in `net_processing`.",

          "body": "This PR opens up the annex in a limited way:\r\n\r\n* If any one of the inputs commits to an annex, all inputs must. This is a mechanism to opt-in to annex use, preventing participants in a multi-party transaction from adding an unexpected annex which would increase the tx weight and lower the fee rate. See https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-June/021736.html\r\n\r\n* Allow empty annexes, to let users opt-in to annex usage with the minimum number of bytes.\r\n\r\n* Additionally, only allow annexes that start with `0x00`. This keeps open the possibility to support structured annexes such as for example the tlv format proposed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1381. A potential future structured format would start with a non-zero byte.\r\n\r\n* Limit the maximum size of unstructured annex data to 256 bytes. Including the annex tag 0x50 and the unstructured data tag 0x00, this makes for a maximum total witness element size of 258 bytes. This upper limit somewhat protects participants in a multi-party transaction that uses the annex against annex inflation.\r\n\r\n  The constant 256 is chosen so that it provides enough space to accommodate several schnorr signatures. This is useful for implementing annex covenants with multiple presigned transactions. For a PoC of a single transaction annex covenant, see https://github.com/joostjager/annex-covenants\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n* [ ] fix/add tests\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n* Max 126 byte unstructured annex without opt-in: https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/22",

This results in some things that would have given an address for P2PK scripts to no longer do so. This is arguably more correct.\r\n\r\n`ExtractDestination`'s behavior is slightly changed for the above. It now returns `true` for those destinations that have addresses, so P2PK scripts now result in `false`. Even though it returns false for `CNoDestination`, the script will now be included in that `CNoDestination`.\r\n\r\nBuilds on #28244",

          "title": "Silent Payments: Implement BIP352",
          "body": "UPDATE: Rather than having a special encoder and decoder for silent payments, it makes more sense to have `CTxDestination` include a `V0SilentPaymentDestination` type. Some pre-work to make this easier is done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28244 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28246 , which this PR now depends on. If you want to review this PR, please review these two first. One is a move-only refactor, and the other a fairly light refactor with minimal behavior changes.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nThis PR is a child of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27827 and only implements the BIP logic without the wallet code. For the wallet implementations:\r\n* #28201 - implements sending\r\n* #28202 - implements receiving\r\n* #27827 - all three PRs together - this PR is meant for tracking progress and is useful for reviewers who want to compile all three PRs at once for testing\r\n\r\n## BIP352\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses strictly on the BIP logic and attempts to separate it from the wallet and transaction implementation details. This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing. Labels for the receiver are optional and thus deferred for a later PR.\r\n\r\nTest vectors from the BIP are included as unit tests.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing, it is strongly recommended you read https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458 and take a look at the reference python implementation on the BIP.\r\n",
