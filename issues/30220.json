    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nWhen running a pruned node it means it will keep only last X amount of GB predefined in the configuration, so why is it necessary to download the whole blockchain if only a tiny part will be kept at the end ? Can't it just download the amount of necessary and most recent data or a method developed for it and to speed up adoption of pruned nodes that will never keep all that amount of data ?\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nRelated to the incredibly long time that takes to sync the whole blockchain. It also contributes to waste bandwidth for data that will never be kept locally and delays the time for starting using the node that may take a whole week to finish a sync.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nDevelop a method for a node when configured to run in pruned mode to only download the necessary data enough to run the pruned node and keep validating new blocks.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
