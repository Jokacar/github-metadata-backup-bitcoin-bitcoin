    "title": "Libbitcoinkernel Project Tracking",
    "body": "#### Project Board: https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/projects/3\r\n\r\nThis is the tracking issue for the `libbitcoinkernel` project. The original tracking issue is found in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303. This issue contains much of the content written by Carl Dong in the original issue but is more regularly updated.\r\n\r\nThe libbitcoinkernel project is a new attempt at extracting Bitcoin Core's consensus engine. The kernel part of the name highlights one of the key functional differences from the deprecated libbitcoinconsensus and in fact, most libraries: it is a stateful library that can spawn threads, do caching, do I/O, and many other things that one may not normally expect from a library.\r\n\r\nThis statefulness is necessary for libbitcoinkernel's decidedly incremental approach to extracting our consensus engine. This approach favors:\r\n\r\n1. Reusing existing code\r\n...which allows us to be continually integrated with Bitcoin Core and benefit from our extensive test suite\r\n\r\n2. Incremental decoupling instead of building from scratch\r\n ...which allows us to avoid having to prematurely optimize for a \"perfect\" boundary or API (tends to be highly subjective, non-obvious, may lead to unproductive bike-shedding before we've even done anything meaningful)\r\n\r\nThe work of extracting our consensus engine into a library and making the API ergonomic is likely to be a multi-release project involving multiple contributors. The incremental approach takes this into account and respects the sheer size of work (both in writing code and getting it through review) that needs to be undertaken.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\nPlease see the project board: https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/projects/3\r\n\r\n## The Game Plan\r\n\r\n* [ ] Stage 1\r\n    * [x] Step 1\r\n    * [x] Step 2\r\n    * [x] Step 3\r\n    * [ ] Step 4\r\n* [ ] Stage 2\r\n\r\n### Stage 1: Extracting out a usable `libbitcoinkernel.{so,dylib,dll}`\r\n#### Step 1: Introduce internal `bitcoin-chainstate` and `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. What `.cpp` files do we need?\r\n\r\nThis `bitcoin-chainstate` executable uses our consensus engine and its build system code revealed the minimal set of files needed to link in to use the consensus engine as-is. This list of files (the `_SOURCES` in `Automake` speak) then serves as the basis for a `libbitcoinkernel`, which `bitcoin-chainstate` will be linked against.\r\n\r\n**Key Result:** Any further coupling of our consensus engine with non-consensus modules will result in linker errors, preventing this project from becoming a Sisyphean task of battling coupling regressions.\r\n#### Step 2: Decouple most non-consensus code from `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. Prune the unnecessary `.cpp` files (and their respective headers)!\r\n\r\nIn this step many modules were removed from the `libbitcoinkernel` that do not logically belong in `libbitcoinkernel` (e.g. `index/*.cpp`, `netaddress.cpp`), but are nevertheless necessary to be included in its `_SOURCES` for `bitcoin-chainstate` to link correctly.\r\n\r\n**Developer Note:** We do not decouple the mempool _yet_ because most users of `libbitcoinkernel` may want to have an embedded mempool with Bitcoin Core's policies and we can decouple it later. This stage is more about extracting obvious non-kernel functionality, like argument parsing, or shutdown handling, than it is about extracting Bitcoin Core specific functionality like assumevalid, assumeutxo, checkpoints, or the mempool. Such extractions fall under stage 2.\r\n\r\n#### Step 3: Decouple most non-consensus headers from `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. Prune the unnecessary `.h` files!\r\n\r\nThe goal of this step is to allow users of the `libbitcoinkernel` to include its header files without having to include headers of external dependencies, platform-specific definitions, or non-consensus related definitions. A linter enforcing that the headers are not re-added to the header tree should be added.\r\n\r\nA notable piece of this step is removing the `boost` multiindex includes currently required by our mempool headers. Due to their extensive usage between multiple modules, it will take longer to complete and might extend into the second stage.\r\n\r\n#### Step 4: Use the `libbitcoinkernel` library for internal compilation\r\n\r\nNow that `libbitcoinkernel` contains some minimal set of source files, it should also be used as an internal library for `libbitcoin_node`. The desired library organization is shown in [doc/design/libraries.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/libraries.md).\r\n\r\n### Stage 2: Ship an external kernel API \r\n\r\nNow that an internal kernel library with a limited feature set exists, expose it to external users with a C header. Start with a reduced header, exposing just enough functionality to build a utility tool. Ideas for such a utility tool could be a rewrite of bitcoin-chainstate using the C header's API, or a reindexer tool. These tools could also be written in other languages, such as Rust or Python. Care should be taken that the API is as consistent as possible in all respects, manages its own memory to the extent possible, minimizes type conversions between C and C++, and keeps versioning in mind.\r\n\r\n* [ ] Introduce initial C API\r\n* [ ] Add utility using the libbitcoinkernel's C API\r\n* [ ] Add tests exercising the C API\r\n* [ ] Bench performance overhead of going through the C API compared to calling the C++ code directly\r\n* [ ] Add fatal error return codes\r\n\r\nIdeally, users looking to integrate with `libbitcoinkernel` will provide inputs on which library features might be desirable to have exposed. The API will initially have a very idiosyncratic, Bitcoin Core-specific interface. Continual polishing over multiple versions will incrementally make the `libbitcoinkernel` API more ergonomic for users outside of Bitcoin Core. Note though, that there is a possible dichotomy here between optimizing the library interface for external users and for the internal interface within Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nAt this point, we have a usable `libbitcoinkernel` that is _somewhat_ minimally linked. However, it has a very idiosyncratic, Bitcoin Core-specific C++ interface. \r\n\r\n## Getting `libbitcoinkernel` Through Review\r\n\r\nThe project will touch a lot of code that will not have been touched in some time and might resurface older issues. Any outstanding review comments not pertinent to the main thrust of a PR will be taken note of in the TODO section below and then either triaged in an issue or addressed in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n## Action Items\r\n\r\n1. If you have any questions, please post them below!\r\n2. If you have any ideas for the future direction of \"Stage 2: Polishing the API / Continual De-coupling\", please leave a comment below, I'd love to talk!\r\n\r\n## Project-wide TODOs\r\n\r\nThese are suggestions for further cleanup and improvements that came up during review:\r\n\r\n* [ ]  Various followups for [[kernel 2c/n] Introduce `kernel::Context`, encapsulate global init/teardown #25065](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065)\r\n  * [x]  ~Marco's post-merge review comments: [[kernel 2c/n] Introduce `kernel::Context`, encapsulate global init/teardown #25065 (review)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065#pullrequestreview-996614232)~\r\n  * [ ]  Cory's `kernel::Context` cleanup suggestions: [[kernel 2c/n] Introduce `kernel::Context`, encapsulate global init/teardown #25065 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065#discussion_r882182549)\r\n* [ ]  Russell's post-merge review comment: [[kernel 2e/n] miner: Make `mempool` optional, stop constructing temporary empty mempools #25223 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25223#discussion_r898164322)\r\n* [ ]  Various followups for [[kernel 3a/n] Decouple `CTxMemPool` from `ArgsManager` #25290](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290)\r\n  * [x]  ~Perform gArgs checking in `ApplyArgsManOptions`: [[kernel 3a/n] Decouple `CTxMemPool` from `ArgsManager` #25290 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290#discussion_r907535652)~\r\n  * [ ]  Perform `CTxMemPool::Options` checking in `CTxMemPool` constructor: [[kernel 3a/n] Decouple `CTxMemPool` from `ArgsManager` #25290 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290#discussion_r900272797)\r\n  * [x]  ~Change `CalculateMemPoolAncestors` to take in `CTxMemPool::Limits` instead: [[kernel 3a/n] Decouple `CTxMemPool` from `ArgsManager` #25290 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290#discussion_r905260891)~\r\n* [ ]  Various followups for [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487)\r\n  * [x] ~Improve `DumpMempool`'s mutex: [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r916228022).~ Won't fix, see [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r923360777).\r\n  * [ ]  Change `LoadMempool`'s semantics: [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r916044902)\r\n  * [ ]  Make LoadMempool less foot-gunny: [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r921234107), [c4249c1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/c4249c1243981f42091950d1295c2be6bd4bf118)\r\n* [ ] Various followups for [refactor, kernel: Decouple ArgsManager from blockstorage #27125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125)\r\n  * [ ] Martin's request for a follow-up fixing the docstring: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125#discussion_r1190350876\r\n* [ ]  Followups for [kernel: Remove util/system from kernel library, interface_ui from validation #27636](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636)\r\n  * [ ] Cory's request for cleaning up the kernel interface functions of pointer and reference types: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1202937682\r\n  \r\n#### Other various items that arose during review and should be tracked\r\n* Marco's request for a minimal iwyu memory include false positive example: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125#discussion_r1184832621\r\n* Marcos' request for unrolling the reindex loop: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125#discussion_r1183633068\r\n* Marco's request for getting rid of exceptions in the `ArgsManager`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27491#discussion_r1189586654\r\n* Russell's request for eliminating the BlockNotify signal: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1193904693\r\n* Russell's request for getting rid of `fWarned`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1193969953\r\n* Aj's request for a simpler std::array serialization routine and c++20: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28423#discussion_r1325169578",

In this step, we add an external `bitcoin-chainstate` with a separate build system to reveal the minimal set of headers we need to ship in order to make the `libbitcoinkernel` library usable.\r\n\r\n#### Step 4: Decouple most non-consensus headers from `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. Prune the unnecessary `.h` files!\r\n\r\nSimilar to Step 2, there are lots of small decoupling of the header dependency tree here. A notable piece of this step is to remove `leveldb` includes from our headers to avoid needing to re-ship `leveldb` headers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stage 2: Polishing the API / Continual De-coupling\r\n\r\nAt this point, we have a usable `libbitcoinkernel` that is _somewhat_ minimally linked. However, it has a very idiosyncratic, Bitcoin Core-specific C++ interface. The goal of this stage is to incrementally make the `libbitcoinkernel` API more ergonomic for users outside of Bitcoin Core. Bindings to other languages (first C, then others) should be introduced.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have near-zero experience with library API design and langauge bindings, so I think ***it would be wise for other contributors to lead this stage***. Ideally, they would be able to work with users looking to integrate with `libbitcoinkernel` who can give an accurate account of the API ergonomics from the library user's point of view. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting `libbitcoinkernel` Through Review\r\n\r\nMost of the changes to be made are \"move only\", but there are a lot of these \"move only\" changes to be made. Of course comments/reviews regarding correctness are always more than welcome, but I want very much to avoid losing momentum on this project because of style or style-adjacent comments/reviews.\r\n\r\nI propose the following ground rules to make this process more streamlined for all parties involved and a few things that I can do to help:\r\n\r\n1. Any outstanding comments/reviews not pertinent to the main thrust of PRs should not delay/block the merging of the core functionality of PRs. I will make sure to open a separate issue tracking all the leftover comments/reviews so that they won't be missed and can be addressed one by one.\r\n2. Whenever the PR reaches a stage where there are only leftover comments/reviews left, I will make a comment saying so. This might make it easier for maintainers to determine roughly where the PR is at in its lifecycle (ofc don't trust me, verify :smile:).\r\n\r\n## Action Items\r\n\r\n1. If you have any questions, please post them below!\r\n2. If you plan on reviewing `libbitcoinkernel` or are a maintainer:\r\n    1. Please make sure you've read the \"Getting `libbitcoinkernel` Through Review\" section above.\r\n    2. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help streamline the review process.\r\n3. If you would like to take the lead on \"Stage 2: Polishing the API / Continual De-coupling\", please leave a comment below, I'd love to talk!",

As a standalone library the libbitcoinkernel should not have to rely on code that accesses shutdown state through a global. Instead, replace it with an interrupt class that is owned by the kernel context. Additionally this moves the remaining usages of the `uiInterface` out of the kernel code. The process of moving the `uiInterface` out of the kernel was started in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken here uses the notification interface to externalize the existing shutdown code from the kernel library. The `SignalInterrupt` kernel context member is passed by reference to the `ChainstateManager` to allow for the termination of long-running kernel functions and sending interrupt signals.\r\n",

This PR also drops the last reference to the `uiInterface` global in kernel code. The process of moving the `uiInterface` out of the kernel was started in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636.\r\n\r\nThis pull request contains a subset of patches originally proposed in #27711. It will be part of a series of changes required to make handling of interrupts (or in other words the current shutdown procedure) in the kernel library more transparent and less reliable on global mutable state. The set of patches contained here was originally proposed by @ryanofsky [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27711#issuecomment-1580779869). ",

However, leveldb-specific functionality should be abstracted by the `dbwrapper` and does not need to be available to the rest of the code. Having leveldb included in a widely-used header such as `dbwrapper.h` bloats the entire project's header tree.\r\n\r\nThe `dbwrapper` is a key component of the libbitcoinkernel library. Future users of this library would not want to contend with  having the leveldb headers exposed and potentially polluting their project's namespace.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the leveldb headers are removed from the `dbwrapper` by moving leveldb-specific code to the implementation file and creating a [pimpl](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl) where leveldb member variables are indispensable. As a final step, the leveldb include flags are removed from the `BITCOIN_INCLUDES` and moved to places where the dbwrapper is compiled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis pull request is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587), and more specifically its stage 1 step 3 \"Decouple most non-consensus headers from libbitcoinkernel\".",

          "title": "RFC: Remove boost usage from kernel api / headers",
          "body": "Similarly to #28327 I wanted to open this PR to receive some opinions and better approaches.\r\n\r\nThe kernel library is currently at the stage where unwanted headers are removed from its set of headers. In practice, this means we are reducing the number of includes that are required for compiling the experimental `bitcoin-chainstate` binary. This is described in stage 1 step 3 of the [project tracking issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).\r\n\r\nCurrently the mempool is part of the kernel library. The mempool headers include the boost multi index headers. Thus any application wanting to use the kernel library and its headers will have to include the boost headers too. This is not only undesirable because of the sheer size of these headers, but also might lead to conflicts if the including application uses a different boost version.\r\n\r\nIn the approach laid out by this PR, mempool member variables and methods are declared in the header without having to include boost by either wrapping them in a struct and [pimpling](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl) them, or making methods static implementation functions. The boost definitions are gathered into separate header (`mempool_set_definitions.h`) that is only included by implementation files that require definitions of the boost types. This allows us to retain the current architecture with roughly the same interfaces. \r\n\r\nThe approach laid out by this PR also has some, albeit small, compilation speed and size benefits. Averaged over a few of compilation runs I consistently observe faster compilation by a couple of seconds and some smaller pre-processed and compiled object sizes. The main detractor of this method is obviously the number of lines touched. However it also has the benefit of inventorizing all the files that require direct access to the mempool data structures as well getting rid of boost multi index includes in non-kernel implementation files that include the mempool, but don't directly manipulate its data structures (e.g. wallet.cpp).\r\n\r\nA much simpler alternative approach, at least on the surface, would be removing all `txmempool.h` includes from kernel library headers (see [this branch](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/mempoolBoostSimple)). Currently this is only `validation.h`.  Due to the mutex member of `CTxMemPool` and the correspondingly defined lock decorators on the chainstate methods this becomes a bit more complicated though and I am not sure how this might be possible with the current architecture.\r\n\r\nA discussion of how and if to remove the mempool from the kernel library has so far been intentionally punted to the next stage of the kernel library development. Pimpling the mempool itself precludes this discussion, since the library could never be shipped with the `CTxMemPool` headers. Pimpling the mempool members (like done in this PR) might also make a future splitting of block and mempool validation logic into separate compilation units easier.",

          "body": "By defining a virtual interface class for the scheduler client, users of the kernel can now define their own event consuming infrastructure, without having to spawn threads or rely on the scheduler design.\r\n\r\nRemoving `CScheduler` also allows removing the thread and exception modules from the kernel library. \r\n\r\nTo make the `CMainSignals` class easier to use from a kernel library perspective, remove its global instantiation and adopt RAII practices.\r\n\r\nRenames `CMainSignals` to `ValidationSignals`, which more accurately describes its purpose and scope.\r\n\r\nAlso make the `ValidationSignals` in the `ChainstateManager` and CTxMemPool` optional. This could be useful in the future for using or testing these classes without having to instantiate any form of signal handling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587). It improves the kernel API and removes two modules from the kernel library.",

Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Move `Split` functions from `util/spanparsing.h` to `util/string.h`, using `util` namespace for clarity.\r\n- Move remaining spanparsing functions to `script/parsing.h` since they are used for descriptor and miniscript parsing.\r\n- Combine `util/fees.h` and `util/errors.h` into `common/messages.h` so there is a place for simple functions that generate user messages to live, and these functions are not part of the util library.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this change is that the util library is a dependency of the kernel, and we should remove functionality from util that shouldn't be called by kernel code or kernel applications. These changes should also improve code organization and make functions easier to discover. Some of these same moves are (or were) part of #28690, but did not help with code organization, or made it worse, so it is better to move them and clean them up in the same PR so code only has to change one time.\r\n",

So move the `ECC_Start` call to the `NodeContext` ctor instead to completely remove the key module from the kernel library.\r\n\r\nThe gui tests currently keep multiple `NodeContext` objects in memory, so call `ECC_Stop` manually to avoid triggering an assertion on `ECC_Start`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587). It removes a module from the kernel library.\r\n",

          "title": "kernel: Handle fatal errors through return values",
          "body": "Based on #25665.\r\n\r\nCurrently functions issuing fatal errors call the `fatalError` notification method to issue a shutdown procedure. This makes it hard for higher level functions to figure out if an error deeper in the call stack occurred. For users of the kernel it might also be difficult to assert which function call issued a fatal error if they are being run concurrently. If the kernel would eventually be used by external users, getting fatal error information through a callback instead of function return values would also be cumbersome and limiting. Unit, bench, and fuzz tests currently don't have a way to effectively test against fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThis patch set is an attempt to make fatal error handling in the kernel code more transparent. Fatal errors are now passed up the call stack through `util::Result<T, FatalError>` failure values. A previous attempt at this by theuni always immediately returned failure values if a function call returned a failure. However, this is not always desirable (see discussion [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27866#discussion_r1256378064)). Sometimes, further operations can still be completed even if a fatal error was issued. The solution to this is that these \"ignored\" errors are still moved through `util::Result`'s error string values with its `.MoveMessages` method, even while a failure value in the result is not present.\r\n\r\nNext to some smaller behavior changes, the most significant change is that the issuing of a shutdown procedure is delayed until a potential fatal error is handled as opposed to immediately when it is first encountered. Another effect is that potential fatal errors are now asserted in the bench, fuzz and unit tests. Some of the currently not immediately returned fatal errors need some further scrutiny. These are marked with a `TODO (fatal error)` comment and could be tackled in a later PR.\r\n\r\nTo validate this approach a new clang-tidy check is introduced. It implements the following checks:\r\n\r\n1. If a function calls another function with a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` return type, its return type has to be `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` too, or it has to handle the value returned by the function with one of `CheckFatal`, `HandleFatalError`,\r\n`UnwrapFatalError`, or `CheckFatalFailure`.\r\n2. In functions returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` a call to a function returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` needs to propagate the value by either:\r\n   - Returning it immediately\r\n   - Assigning it immediately to an existing result with `.MoveMessages()` or `.Set()`\r\n   - Eventually passing it as an argument to a `.MoveMessages()`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587) and is a step towards stage 2, creating a more refined kernel API.",
