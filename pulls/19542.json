Every serializer can define its own parameter type, and a value of that type must be provided when serializing/deserializing, e.g. using `ss << WithParams(parameter, value)`, causing `value` to be serialized to `ss`, with parameter `parameter`. Note these parameters are automatically passed down the stack, so for example a vector can be serialized with a parameter, which will be available to all the elements' serializers.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the feature is only used for `CAddress` serialization, but I plan to also convert `SERIALIZE_TRANSACTION_NO_WITNESS` in a follow-up. Eventually I hope to get rid of all GetVersion/GetType and replace it with this approach, which is type-safe (code won't compile if the correct parameter isn't passed somewhere), and avoids collisions between flags.",

          "body": "This replaces the transaction request logic with an encapsulated class that maintains all the state surrounding it. By keeping it stand alone, it can be easily tested (using included unit tests and fuzz tests).\r\n\r\nThe new logic is close in spirit to the current one, but much easier to specify I think:\r\n* Always prefer outbound peers over inbound peers, as long as any are available.\r\n* Don't download from inbound peers during the first 2 s after announcement, to give time for announcements from outbound peers to come in.\r\n* The peer who is the very first to announce a txid is preferred (compared to other inbounds or other outbounds), so that chains of dependent transactions announced by one peer will generally not be split out to other peers.\r\n* After the peer that announces a txid first, requests go to uniformly selected peers (outbounds first; inbounds that are past their 2 s delay afterwards), to minimize the impact an attacker can have (as attackers can easily race the network and be first).\r\n* A txid is never requested twice from the same peer, as long as other candidates remain (even when reannounced).\r\n* Transactions are requested from new candidates as soon as old requests expire, or NOTFOUND is received, or invalid-witness transactions are received (i.e. this includes the functionality added by, and replaces, #18238).\r\n\r\nOne significant change is the removal of the in-flight limit of 100 txids. I think this limit is not exactly desirable (e.g. when a txid is only announced by one peer, we should request it, regardless of how many other txids we're already waiting for), and with the changes to handle NOTFOUND immediately, there is less problems with high limits. This implementation's performance is also only determined by the number of total transaction/peer pairs tracked (O(log n)), not by the number in-flight, removing another reason for having that limit.\r\n\r\nA few further improvements could be investigated and relatively easily added if desirable:\r\n* Biasing away from peers with lots of in-flight requests (but not outright limiting like now).\r\n* Making the 2s inbound delay Poisson-distributed.\r\n* Adding a wtxid flag to entries to make it compatible with #18044.\r\n* Adding a time limit for the time between announcement and request.\r\n\r\nWhile the implementation is non-trivial due to performance and resource usage considerations, it has a significantly simpler exact specification. This specification is documented in src/txrequest.h, and reimplemented naively in the src/test/fuzz/txrequest.cpp fuzz test. It may be a good idea to review those first to understand the desired semantics before digging into the optimized implementation.\r\n",

      "body": ">  reverting it would mean rebasing everything yet again\r\n\r\nThey could also be reset to the previous version, as this was the only conflict. (Assuming no other changes to the pulls in question happened in the meantime).\r\n\r\nAs to the conceptual discussion, I think everyone agrees with @theuni that connman should be treated as an optional pointer. In current master, connman is a pointer (and it is not trivially possible to make it a non-pointer). https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c04485850e72e773280e0cc8d88e73ec791bef73/src/node/context.h#L36\r\nAlso, places where connman could be nullptr properly check for that. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c04485850e72e773280e0cc8d88e73ec791bef73/src/rpc/mining.cpp#L640-L642\r\n\r\nHowever, the lines changed by the patch are called only where connman is already confirmed to be not null. If we go ahead to merge this, it would be good to document in the code or somewhere else why those cases should be treated as pointers and, at the same time, why nullptr checks are not needed for them. \r\n\r\nACK 1aff21b36450644390d6361d496811dda5a6ae31 for now. I only checked that it cleanly reverts, but ideally we'd have clear documentation on how to pass connman around and why. Sorry for causing this disagreement in the first place. I wish the time spent on this was used on user-facing changes, but properly documenting this will hopefully avoid misunderstandings in the future.",

It is totally doable within couple minutes.\r\n\r\nThen, with some extra protocol knowledge a spy can infer the direct peers of the victim, and other topological stuff.\r\n\r\nI suggest to cache responses to GETADDR on a daily basis, so that an attacker gets at most 1,000 records per day, and can’t track the changes in real time. I will be following up with more improvements to addr relay privacy, but this one alone is a very effective. And simple!\r\n\r\nI doubt any of the real software does *reconnect to get new addrs from a given peer*, so we shouldn’t be cutting anyone.\r\nI also believe it doesn’t have any negative implications on the overall topology quality. And the records being “outdated” for at most a day doesn’t break any honest assumptions either.",

I suspect I was wrong with the concept nack anyway...\r\n[14:26] <cfields> it's not a big deal, though.\r\n[14:28] <jnewbery> cfields: thanks!\r\n[14:30] <cfields> np, these things happen :)\r\n[14:33] <wumpus> yes, though, \"this causes a few PRs to need to be rebased\" was another reason to be cautious about merging it in the first place\r\n[14:34] <wumpus> I think we should avoid doing these kind of mass data type changes unless there is a really good rationale and people agree about doing it\r\n[14:34] <wumpus> \"increases code quality\" is kind of subjective\r\n[14:38] <wumpus> if it's uncontroversial and doesn't impact other people's work, okay, but not sure about this\r\n[14:48] <jnewbery> wumpus: yes, agree. When I wrote my ACK I originally had a comment about not merging immediately because of conflicts, but I deleted that because I didn't want to tell the maintainers how to do their job\r\n[16:46] <MarcoFalke> when merging I do check all conflicts for reviews, and in this case, all of the conflicts had either, no review, didn't compile, or didn't pass the test suite. So in all cases a rebase or force push wouldn't have been harmful or was needed anyway.\r\n",

I'll make sure that future NACKs come with a more thorough review.\r\n\r\nI agree with @jnewbery's assessment here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19174#issuecomment-658627037.\r\n\r\nAs a note on process, I rather appreciate the way this worked out. Bad reviews should be called out as such (as @MarcoFalke and @jnewbery did), and worrisome merges should be pointed out for discussion (as @JeremyRubin did), even if ultimately no further action is taken. Though one might argue that I was so off-base on my argument that @MarcoFalke was right not to sit around and wait for me to figure it out :)\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone for being reasonable. Sorry for the noise!",

          "title": "Use wtxid for transaction relay",
          "body": "Using txids (a transaction's hash, without witness) for transaction relay is problematic, post-segwit -- if a peer gives us a segwit transaction that fails policy checks, it could be because the txid associated with the transaction is definitely unacceptable to our node (regardless of the witness), or it could be that the transaction was malleated and with a different witness, the txid could be accepted to our mempool.\r\n\r\nWe have a bloom filter of recently rejected transactions, whose purpose is to help us avoid redownloading and revalidating transactions that fail to be accepted, but because of this potential for witness malleability to interfere with relay of valid transactions, we do not use the filter for segwit transactions.  This issue is discussed at some length in #8279.  The effect of this is that whenever a segwit transaction that fails policy checks is relayed, a node would download that transaction from every peer announcing it, because it has no way presently to cache failure.  Historically this hasn't been a big problem, but if/when policy for accepting segwit transactions were to change (eg taproot, or any other change), we could expect older nodes talking to newer nodes to be wasting bandwidth because of this.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in that issue, switching to wtxid-based relay solves this problem -- by using an identifier for a transaction that commits to all the data in our relay protocol, we can be certain if a transaction that a peer is announcing is one that we've already tried to process, or if it's something new.  This PR introduces support for wtxid-based relay with peers that support it (and remains backwards compatible with peers that use txids for relay, of course).\r\n\r\nApart from code correctness, one issue to be aware of is that by downloading from old and new peers alike, we should expect there to be some bandwidth wasted, because sometimes we might download the same transaction via txid-relay as well as wtxid-relay.  The last commit in this PR implements a heuristic I want to analyze, which is to just delay relay from txid-relay peers by 2 seconds, if we have at least 1 wtxid-based peer.  I've just started running a couple nodes with this heuristic so I can measure how well it works, but I'm open to other ideas for minimizing that issue.  In the long run, I think this will be essentially a non-issue, so I don't think it's too big a concern, we just need to bite the bullet and deal with it during upgrade.\r\n\r\nFinally, this proposal would need a simple BIP describing the changes, which I haven't yet drafted.  However, review and testing of this code in the interim would be welcome.\r\n\r\nTo do items:\r\n- [x] Write BIP explaining the spec here (1 new p2p message for negotiating wtxid-based relay, along with a new INV type)\r\n- [ ] Measure and evaluate a heuristic for minimizing how often a node downloads the same transaction twice, when connected to old and new nodes.",
