    "body": "Recently I was discussing how to lock down access on a Bitcoin node with @jlin816 and we came up with 2 features that would be useful.\r\n\r\nProposing 2 features:\r\n\r\n1. rpc.conf file, which contains a list of enabled RPCs. No other RPCs should be callable. rpc.conf should be loaded at startup. The default file is all of them. Can also be passed in as command line args perhaps.\r\n1. a compile time flag file whitelist. The default file is all of them. This eases the production of custom builds where it would be impossible for the RPC to be called even if rpc.conf is not correctly set.\r\n\r\nIt's not high priority, but having this would make it easier to produce bitcoin node binaries for high security environments.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any thoughts or reservations on the above design before @jlin816 takes a crack at it (for her first contribution). Is this functionality already possible without external proxy?",

      "body": "Can you give an example use-case? As presented it sounds reasonable, though I'm a bit concerned about real-world utility.\r\n\r\nRPC should definitely not be open to the world, no matter how locked down, so I'll assume that you're referring to a localhost or encrypted tunnel.\r\n\r\nIn that case, access to the user's profile dir should already be assumed. So I can't imagine locking down for the sake of privacy, but maybe to ensure maximum availability. So maybe you disable getblocktemplate because you don't want some jerk employee mining and wasting cpu resources from your exchange's edge node.\r\n\r\nOr maybe you run a website that shows mempool data, so you want to unlock rpc access for a bitcoind on your subnet, with access mempool data only.\r\n\r\nDo those examples sound about right?\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced that it's necessary because (other than wallet), there's no privilege separation between the commands, so only real need for black/whitelists would be: \"some rpc call is an effective DoS on my server so I want to block it\". I'm not sure that we should be encouraging that, rather than just not having DoSsy rpcs :(\r\n\r\nThat said, a few things to look into:\r\n- We already have a \"safe mode\" that limits usable commands when we're uneasy about the chain we're on. That's not useful here, but it may be hepful to look at how it's implemented.\r\n- Echoing what @ryanofsky said, tying this to auth makes sense to me, so that different rpc users can have different command access.",

      "body": "Thanks for the feedback! I wrote up my preliminary ideas on the design and justification for why this feature is needed -- let me know if you have any reservations before I start implementing a proof-of-concept. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\nThere is currently no way to lock down the JSON RPC API without filtering requests through a proxy (or application). In high security situations, we want to guarantee that only necessary and expected API calls can be made by specifying this behavior at the bitcoind node level. This doesn’t preclude the use of a proxy to filter requests, but augments it with an additional layer of safety checks.\r\n\r\n# Example Use Case\r\nWe make requests to the bitcoind through a proxy, ensuring that most clients will only be able to call a limited set of RPC methods. However, the proxy itself maintains an authenticated connection to our node with full privilege, making misbehavior potentially dangerous. We would like to guarantee that only the methods required by the application are available, precluding access to critical (i.e. leaking secrets or DoS-vectors) methods not required by the application. Even if an adversary can do _some_ dangerous things, they can’t do _arbitrarily_ dangerous things that we can prevent up front.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this is desirable because it:\r\n- Adds redundant layers of security\r\n- Protects against programmer error (configure system once, iterate on application code without having to worry about regressing accidentally to unsafe behavior or accidentally leaking some secret as a side effect)\r\n- Explicitly defines expectations for privilege and performance.\r\n    - Opportunities for future work to enforce resource management per connection/`rpcauth` credential. (E.g., only allowing one rescan per day)\r\n- Introduces concept of privilege separation between commands, helps developers build more robust software, and encourages better practices\r\n    - Bitcoin’s RPC API was not designed with the idea that a caller could be partially trusted. As @theuni put it, there’s no explicit concept of privilege separation.\r\n    - Adding the ability to whitelist is a step towards recognizing the implicit privilege boundaries that do exist, such as a read v.s. a write operation, a stateful operation (like `addnode`), and a DoS vector operation (like `import` with `rescan`)\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\nWe use a whitelist because it is better to be explicit about what is allowed rather than what is not allowed. This ensures that even if new, unsafe, RPCs are added, the functionality is not exposed by using old conf files. My design is based off of the rpcauth feature only -- if you are in a high security setting, you likely should favor rpcauth over rpcuser anyways; this serves as a soft deprecation. I’ve written out my design using [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml), but we can use whatever Bitcoin uses, if that’s preferable.\r\n\r\n## Runtime Configuration Design\r\n\r\nRuntime `rpc.conf` will allow you to specify granular user-level privileges. For example, the following demonstrates how I’m proposing to create a `rpcauth` user allowed to access wallet RPCs and a second user that can also call `getblockchaininfo`.\r\n\r\n**rpc.conf**\r\n```\r\nimport = [rpc_base.conf]\r\n[rpcuser1]\r\n\tincludes = [wallet]\r\n[rpcuser2]\r\n\tincludes = [rpcuser1]\r\n\tgetblockchaininfo = 1\r\n```\r\n**rpc_base.conf**\r\n```\r\n[wallet]\r\n\t//... < list all enabled wallet methods here >\r\n```\r\n**bitcoin.conf**\r\n```\r\nrpcauth=rpcuser1:76cc9394b1e7e7a4b04694f24f8d59e8$e366de9398ed25150874915e7f4d2fcbc13a0df06f0e6a324515e5651f9dfa43\r\nrpcauth=rpcuser2:69d492fe5bb73253d5adaed75987fb9e$c0b939d2ee9723bb289734c320fee83e2724af3ec681c3276df4d2ced515b1e1\r\n```\r\n### Design Considerations\r\nThere are two obvious ways we can do this, either grouping by user or grouping by rpc.\r\n\r\n**By RPC:**\r\n```\r\n[gennewaddress]\r\nmode=’on’ // enabled for all users\r\n\r\n[gettransaction]\r\nmode=’select’ // enabled for some users\r\nusers = [\r\n     rpcuser1,\r\n     rpcuser2\r\n]\r\n\r\n// [dumpprivkey]\r\n//     mode=’off’ // disabled, not needed explicitly because whitelist\r\n\r\n```\r\nPros of RPC-based:\r\n- Succinct; most of the time most users will have most methods. \r\n\r\nCons of RPC-based:\r\n- Needs more complexity to specify argument / value-based privileges for each user down the line\r\n\r\n**By User:**\r\n```\r\n[rpcuser1]\r\n    gettransaction=1\r\n    gennewaddress=1\r\n[rpcuser2]\r\n    gennewaddress=1\r\n    gettransaction=1\r\n    dumpprivkey=1\r\n[rpcuser3]\r\n    gennewaddress=1\r\n```\r\nPros of user-based:\r\n- Easy to read / figure out which users have which privileges \r\n- Easy to specify more granular privileges at the level of arguments / values for each user down the line\r\n- Easy to implement\r\n\r\nCons of user-based:\r\n- If all users require most RPCs, tables are long and repetitive, therefore difficult to audit\r\n\r\nOverall, it seems that a user-centric configuration is preferable.\r\n\r\nTo address the cons of user based paradigm, we’ve introduced a notion of inheritance and several base classes (all, networking, wallet, info, etc) as well as a method of importing files. We can then describe the privileges of a user with access to the same commands as another user and access to any of the general info commands as follows:\r\n\r\n**rpc.conf**\r\n```\r\nimport = [rpc_base.conf]\r\n[rpcuser1]\r\n\tgettransaction=1\r\n\tgennewaddress=1\r\n[rpcuser2]\r\n\tincludes = [rpcuser1, info]\r\n\tdumpprivkey=1\r\n```\r\n**rpc_base.conf**\r\n```\r\n[info]\r\n\tgettransactions=1\r\n\tget...\r\n[network]\r\n\t...\r\n```\r\n\r\nConflicting definitions would be resolved to the child’s definition (e.g., allowing to disable one single command in info). Circular dependencies result in undefined behavior (we could check for it, but it seems like overkill).\r\n\r\nOn startup, we’ll load in the configuration for all users as a hashtable. On each RPC request, we can check permissions to invoke method with name (and down the line, specific options/args for that method).\r\n\r\n### Long-term considerations + extensions\r\nTo address @ryanofsky’s suggestion of filtering params at the argument or value level, we can shell out to a script with path defined in the config file. I.e., we can pipe the json of the command to a subprocess which then pipes back a new json or error message. This permits flexibility because the types of properties you might want to check are sufficiently complicated that it would be inappropriate to try to express that logic in a config file. This design is similar to what’s done with `walletnotify` scripts. We’ll leave that for future work to more tightly define.\r\n\r\n## Compile Time Configuration\r\nThe simplest way to do compile time configuration would be to have an autogenerated header file which defines (or doesn’t define) a macro for every RPC. Then, each handler can be wrapped with an ifdef. This is a little bit messy, so what might be nicer would be to make our class from the runtime whitelist checker read these compile time rules. This is slightly less good because the code is still compiled, but accomplishes the goal of the RPC not being able to be called independent of modifiable configuration. I think it makes the most sense to focus on the runtime configuration first, and then in future work address the compile time flags.\r\n\r\n# Compatibility\r\nThis feature will be mostly backward-compatible: if users do not have `rpc.conf` defined, RPC behavior will be the same as before. The default `rpc.conf` will allow all RPCs for all users.\r\n",

Typical users don't have to touch the RPC configuration, but others at least have the option to restrict access if they have more precise needs.\r\n\r\nre: config file - You make a good point; my previous design does add some complexity for the sake of flexibility. Formatting aside (not particularly attached to TOML and I can certainly use the syntax you suggest), are you objecting specifically to inheriting roles and `includes`? The advantage there seems non-trivial, to avoid typing out all hundred or so allowed RPCs for every new user.\r\n\r\nre: shelling out - My plan is to implement any checking logic I require in proxy, so I'm on board with not adding native CGI-like support.",

          "title": "Add RPC Whitelist Feature from #12248",
          "body": "Summary\r\n====\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the RPC whitelisting feature requested in #12248. RPC Whitelists help enforce application policies for services being built on top of Bitcoin Core (e.g., your Lightning Node maybe shouldn't be adding new peers). The aim of this PR is not to make it advisable to connect your Bitcoin node to arbitrary services, but to reduce risk and prevent unintended access.\r\n\r\nUsing RPC Whitelists\r\n====\r\nThe way it works is you specify (in your bitcoin.conf) configurations such as\r\n\r\n```\r\nrpcauth=user1:4cc74397d6e9972e5ee7671fd241$11849357f26a5be7809c68a032bc2b16ab5dcf6348ef3ed1cf30dae47b8bcc71\r\nrpcauth=user2:181b4a25317bff60f3749adee7d6bca0$d9c331474f1322975fa170a2ffbcb176ba11644211746b27c1d317f265dd4ada\r\nrpcauth=user3:a6c8a511b53b1edcf69c36984985e$13cfba0e626db19061c9d61fa58e712d0319c11db97ad845fa84517f454f6675\r\nrpcwhitelist=user1:getnetworkinfo\r\nrpcwhitelist=user2:getnetworkinfo,getwalletinfo, getbestblockhash\r\nrpcwhitelistdefault=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow user1 can only call getnetworkinfo, user2 can only call getnetworkinfo or getwalletinfo, while user3 can still call all RPCs. \r\n\r\nIf any rpcwhitelist is set, act as if all users are subject to whitelists unless rpcwhitelistdefault is set to 0. If rpcwhitelistdefault is set to 1 and no rpcwhitelist is set, act as if all users are subject to whitelists.\r\n\r\n\r\nReview Request\r\n=====\r\nIn addition to normal review, would love specific review from someone working on LN (e.g., @ roasbeef) and someone working on an infrastructure team at an exchange (e.g., @ jimpo) to check that this works well with their system.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThe rpc list is spelling sensitive -- whitespace is stripped though. Spelling errors fail towards the RPC call being blocked, which is safer.\r\n\r\nIt was unclear to me if HTTPReq_JSONRPC is the best function to patch this functionality into, or if it would be better to place it in exec or somewhere else.\r\n\r\nIt was also unclear to me if it would be preferred to cache the whitelists on startup or parse them on every RPC as is done with multiUserAuthorized. I opted for the cached approach as I thought it was a bit cleaner.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Work\r\n=====\r\n\r\nIn a future PR, I would like to add an inheritance scheme. This seemed more controversial so I didn't want to include that here. Inheritance semantics are tricky, but it would also make these whitelists easier to read.\r\n\r\nIt also might be good to add a `getrpcwhitelist` command to facilitate permission discovery.\r\n\r\nTests\r\n=====\r\nThanks to @ emilengler for adding tests for this feature. The tests cover all cases except for where `rpcwhitelistdefault=1` is used, given difficulties around testing with the current test framework.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "This PR was part of #16115 but reviewers requested that this be made into a separate PR. As explained in #16115, it's useful, maybe even crucial, for support, analysis, and debugging purposes for the configuration arguments to be present in the `debug.log` file, as that may be the only artifact provided to the developer or support team. That PR logs the configuration settings (command-line arguments and `bitcoin.conf` contents) when `bitcoind` starts. But sometime later, the debug log file may be \"rotated\" (a new `debug.log` file started so it doesn't grow unbounded in size) and this information would be lost unless the previous `debug.log` is preserved.\r\n\r\nThis PR re-logs the configuration information when the log rotates, ensuring that the current `debug.log` file contains this information. Reviewers had reservations about the previous approach (which you can see in #16115's discussion thread), so this PR implements this functionality in a simpler and (I believe) much better way.",

This PR aims to improve privacy dramatically while preserving the benefits of rebroadcasting that ensure txns are successfully propagated through the network.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces changes so nodes will resend transactions that it believes should have already been mined. It extracts the logic from the wallet into the mempool, so nodes will rebroadcast txns regardless of the originating wallet. Txns are defined as \"should have been mined\" by using the block assembler logic, and excluding txns that were recently added to the mempool. The wallet will resubmit txns to the mempool on a regular cadence to ensure those txns aren't dropped (due to eviction, expiry, etc..) before being confirmed. \r\n\r\nFor more information, see: https://gist.github.com/amitiuttarwar/b592ee410e1f02ac0d44fcbed4621dba",

While being very useful, due to the complexity, some of them (e.g. multisig, partially signed tx) might never make it onto a user level. \r\n\r\nProposal: Introduction of an advanced user level. At advanced level, a limited RPC interface is enabled which serves all regular functions except those where private keys are involved. \r\n\r\nThis would allow 3rd parties to create guiding software, which takes over the complex steps of those functions, while remaining trustless. \r\n\r\nMy 2 cents so far, probably enough to trigger a discussion.",

      "body": "Yeah there's still a bit to do; but I got discouraged by it taking 2 years to merge to finish the work.\r\n\r\nUp next for this would be:\r\n\r\n1) Adding some permission-discovery RPC so you can see which perms you have\r\n2) Adding a credential fork and dropper thing, allowing you to pass short-lived capability credentials.\r\n3) Adding some sort of limits system.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine in the future, I have a process which has a \"master API key\" to my node, with a maximal set of perms required. I can take my credential, and call the fork RPC to generate a child credential. Then i call AddPerm (one by one) on the credential with my master API key. Then I send it to the appropraite sub process. The subprocess receives the credential. The subprocess calls query_my_rpcs with the new credential. If it has the query_my_rpcs permission set (which we can default to being on safely I think as an exception...), then it learns a table of what permissions it has and if it matches a manifest for that process of what it needs to complete it's task, or if it needs to prompt the user for more credentials. You can imagine that core then has a credential manager GUI pop up and asks if it should honor the request for more credentials -- both apps can show a pin or high entropy generative art so you know it's not a MITM or something... \r\n\r\nIs this overkill? Maybe. Does it need to be in Core? Maybe not... Is this *useful*. Yes, very.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy do we need this?\r\n\r\nAs people set up more sophisticated home infrastructure, permissioning systems are critical to make easier to use and clearer. See https://twitter.com/cpc464_a500/status/1254441275773853702/photo/1 . Super cool, right? Each new service imposes additional security risk. I want people to run services safely. Right now the experience for setting up credentials is to manually add then to Bitcoin Core's conf and restart. A system that lets you hand out the cookies and short lived (perhaps even bound to a specific request, number of requests, or amount of btc) is going to help apps integrate more smoothly and decrease master-password behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I think this is actually a relatively high priority project for end user security, but think it merits some consensus on how much complexity we'd put in core and how much we should build out as e.g. a proxy server.

A simple RPC whitelist per user seems ok to me, as now, but all this complexity in RPC preprocessing does not belong in bitcoin core. It creates a ballooning of maintenance and testing overhead for something only a few people will use.\r\n\r\nAgree with @gmaxwell. Forking out for permission checks is out of the question.  If you need that level of dynamic programmable access control (does anyone? `bitcoind` is intended to process mostly public data) a proxy is more appropriate.",

      "body": "@laanwj I don't think anyone's currently proposing shelling out FWIW.\r\n\r\nThe minimally useful set of credential features to support such a proxy are:\r\n\r\n1) whitelistrpc (done!)\r\n2) generate temp credential\r\n3) add permission from credential to credential\r\n4) restrict credential to specific wallet\r\n5) figure out what permissions I have\r\n\r\nWith that I think a proxy can only be needed for advanced circumstances, and we cover most use cases very nicely with what exists in core. And there's not too much complexity around those 5 features to maintain.\r\n\r\nUltimately I think that with @ryanofsky's work a lot of the RPC stuff can be split out anyways, so the maintenance of this stuff is less of a bitcoind concern and more of an RPC server concern. A bulk of the RPCs we care to protect are specifically the non-public data stuff in bitcoind (wallets). \r\n\r\nWith regards to whether or not people _use_ it, I certainly hope if we build something that supports finer grained permissions that people will use it as it can help reduce attack surface, especially for messy things like setting up a config file with keys for every service that will access the node.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, people invariably are going to be hooking up more services to bitcoinds. And do think it's our job to have a coherent story around how users are generating and integrating these credentials into the services they are allowing access. If that's a separate codebase, fine. But that user story needs to exist to narrow case where the user chooses to do something dumb (e.g., unlimited shared credentials that never get revoked or refreshed). If we want this to be something that all apps in the bitcoin ecosystem will use the same format/protocol for getting authorization and credentials, then it does become a standard so that services can integrate in a defined way.\r\n\r\n",

What application developers really need is a method of *discovering* what RPCs are available to a user, are available on the node but not whitelisted, and what version of the RPC call they are compatible with (in case there is a semantic change or new args).\r\n\r\nThis transcends just whitelist related usage, it's really useful when trying to support multiple node versions (as such, it makes it slightly time sensitive to release this soon/with backports as any feature discovery tool can only be used on nodes which have the feature discovery API).
