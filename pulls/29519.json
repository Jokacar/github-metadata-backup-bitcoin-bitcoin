          "body": "The `PopulateAndValidateSnapshot` function introduced in f6e2da5fb7c6406c37612c838c998078ea8d2252 from #19806 has been setting fake `nTx` and `nChainTx` values that can show up in RPC results (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29328) and make `CBlockIndex` state hard to reason about, because it is difficult to know whether the values are real or fake.\r\n\r\nRevert to previous behavior of setting `nTx` and `nChainTx` to 0 when the values are unknown, instead of faking them. Also drop no-longer needed `BLOCK_ASSUMED_VALID` flag.\r\n\r\nDropping the faked values also fixes assert failures in the `CheckBlockIndex` `(pindex->nChainTx == pindex->nTx + prev_chain_tx)` check that could happen previously if forked or out-of-order blocks before the snapshot got submitted while the snapshot was being validated. The PR includes two commits adding tests for these failures and describing them in detail.\r\n\r\nCompatibility note: This change could cause new `-checkblockindex` failures if a snapshot was loaded by a previous version of Bitcoin Core and not fully validated, because fake `nTx` values will have been saved to the block index. It would be pretty easy to avoid these failures by adding some compatibility code to `LoadBlockIndex` and changing `nTx` values from 1 to 0 when they are fake (when `(pindex->nStatus & BLOCK_VALID_MASK) < BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS`), but a little simpler not to worry about being compatible in this case.",

Obviously let me know if I missed anything.\r\n\r\n## Critical Issues/PRs\r\n\r\n- [x] #29612 (which fixes #25675) - Improves size of dump, critical because it is not backwards compatible\r\n- [ ] #29519 - Stop syncing non-snapshot chain from peers that are already connected\r\n- [x] #29726 - Fix -reindex behavior\r\n- [x] #29370 - Get rid of faked nTx and nChainTx values (closing issues discussed in #29261)\r\n- [ ] #29720 - RPC fixes for missing values, addressing #29328\r\n- [ ] #30267 - Prevent issues from loading dump for invalid block\r\n- [ ] #28553 - The mainnet params themselves\r\n\r\n## Optional Issues/PRs\r\n\r\n(Attempted a rough ordering by importance)\r\n\r\n- [ ] #28616 (which fixes #28598) - Show background chain funds as not fully confirmed in GUI\r\n- [ ] #29553 - `dumptxoutset` with height param\r\n- [ ] #30214 - First part of #28608\r\n- [x] (obsolete) #28670 - Improved error handling for `loadtxoutset`\r\n- [x] #29478 - Additional test coverage for `loadtxoutset`\r\n- [x] #29617 - Additional test coverage\r\n- [x] #29973 - Additional test coverage\r\n- [x] #29428 - Additional test coverage\r\n- [ ]  #29996 - Additional test coverage\r\n- [ ] #29993 - Improve usability\r\n- [ ] #28608 (draft) - State and locking cleanup\r\n\r\n## Critical conceptual discussion\r\n\r\n- [ ] Agreement on a rule of thumb which height we choose once there is consensus for mainnet readiness, i.e. how to choose the height for #28553 once we are close to an upcoming release. I think the earlier we discuss this the better, so that this doesn't get in the way later.\r\n\r\n## Optional conceptual discussion\r\n\r\nThese were taken from #28553 and [the original assumeutxo PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27596#issuecomment-1727936044).\r\n\r\n- [ ] Distribution of snapshots - This recently came up [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29551#pullrequestreview-1917416713) and [here](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2024-03-07#1012635;). There are multiple levels to this topic but I believe that this is not critical either way. If it were critical then, at the most basic level, we would probably provide an \"official\" torrent/download link for the dump with the release. It would be great if one or more contributors could do that (@Sjors did this in #28516 for example) and are willing to maintain this for a reasonable amount of time but it is not critical IMO because anyone can use `dumptxoutset` to recreate the dump and then share it any way they like. So there is no need to provide this service from within the project. I think anyone who plans to distribute the dump to other users (think of downstream projects like BTCPayServer, Raspiblitz, Umbrel, Greenlight etc.) should validate the dump like this at least once anyway. And there may even be options for distribution possible for downstream projects that we can not even think of right now but if we don't make the feature available they can also not be explored.\r\n- [ ] Usage of MuHash #27669 - While it would be nice to have this I don't think it is blocking because this can still be introduced later without invalidating existing dumps.\r\n- [ ] Make params configurable/not hardcoded params - I think it would be good to stay on the safe side for now and make the feature available to the public as originally planned. If the feature sees wide adoption and requests for more flexibility come in that would be the right point to explore this further.\r\n- [ ] Should old hashes be removed from source code at some point? - Obviously not relevant for the first mainnet params\r\n- [ ] How frequently should we update testnet/signet params and is there any way to deal with the possibility that these chains [may get nuked at some point](https://x.com/kallewoof/status/1763222648367308958)?",

I think that this existing separation should work well, the problem that this PR fixes is that `FindNextBlocksToDownload` would pick historical blocks from the background chain when it shouldn't because higher-prio blocks are available.",

Then we have capacity for this peer left and would actually ask for the historical blocks via `TryDownloadingHistoricalBlocks()`.\r\n\r\nSo I think what would actually happen on mainnet and signet is that each time we can process a block request with an existing peer, we'd move `pindexLastCommonBlock` 1024 blocks ahead, and then request historical blocks - until `pindexLastCommonBlock` has reached the snapshot. So we'd continuing downloading the background chain for a while (a few minutes?) with existing peers until we switch over to the snapshot chain (instead of never switching over as I originally thought when opening this PR).\r\n\r\nStill, I think that this behavior is not great, and the fix is an improvement - not only because we start downloading the snapshot chain immediately, we also do much less iterating in `FindNextBlocksToDownload` , moving `pindexLastCommonBlock` ahead without actually downloading anything.\r\n",

          "title": "RFC: Assumeutxo and large forks and reorgs",
          "body": "(tl;dr This is mainly a question about when an assumeutxo snapshot is loaded, if it makes more sense for the original chainstate to continue downloading and attaching blocks in the normal way, or if it should only download and attach blocks leading up to the snapshot block.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt seems unclear how validation code should behave when an assumeutxo snapshot is loaded, and then new headers are received pointing to a forked chain with more proof of work than any known chain including the snapshot block. This question come up in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29519#discussion_r1628436308.\r\n\r\nThis is not an urgent question, because if this situation arose on the network there would be bigger issues to confront than assumeutxo behavior, but it's worth raising because there seem to be different ways of dealing with it that impact that design of validation code, and maybe also have implications in other cases like eclipse attacks.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nWhen an assumeutxo snapshot is loaded, a new chainstate object is created. A chainstate is just a UTXO database and a pointer to the last block added to the database.\r\n\r\nSo immediately after the assumeutxo snapshot is loaded there are two chainstates:\r\n\r\n- The original chainstate pointing at the most-work block which has been locally validated. (This block should normally be an ancestor of the snapshot block, but doesn't have to be.)\r\n\r\n- A new snapshot chainstate pointing at the snapshot block, which has been not been locally validated and probably not downloaded, but is assumed-valid.\r\n\r\nAfter this point, because of missing block and undo data before the snapshot, the snapshot chainstate is constrained to only sync to chains including the snapshot block. If headers for chains with more work not including the snapshot block are found, the snapshot chainstate needs to ignore them, because even if it downloaded blocks on those chains, it would lack the undo data needed to reorg and actually validate them.\r\n\r\nIt is less clear whether the original chainstate should also ignore chains not including the snapshot block.\r\n\r\n### Possible behavior: Original chainstate targets the most-work chain\r\n\r\nThis is not what currently happens, but simplest approach might be for the original chainstate to be unaffected by the snapshot chainstate, and to continue to download and attach the same blocks it otherwise would have if no snapshot were loaded. It would just do it more slowly due to a reduced cache size and lower priority for block requests compared to the snapshot chainstate.\r\n\r\n### Current behavior: Original chainstate targets the snapshot block\r\n\r\nCurrently, instead of the original chainstate being unaffected by the snapshot chainstate, it's constrained to only download and blocks that are ancestors of the snapshot block, and ignore other chains.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nPossible advantages of original chainstate targeting the most work chain:\r\n\r\n- Probably simpler implemenation. If original chainstate behaves the same way whether or not a snapshot is loaded, fewer special cases need to exist when a snapshot is loaded.\r\n- Would sync to most-work chain faster if most-work chain did not include the snapshot block and turned out to be valid (i.e. not a hard fork)\r\n- Maybe more philosophically neutral, because the node continues normal behavior of syncing to the most-work chain, instead of ignoring any chain not including the snapshot block.\r\n\r\nPossible advantages of original chainstate targeting the snapshot block:\r\n\r\n- This what code currently does so would not require further changes.\r\n- Maybe could provide resilience against hard forks that contain more work? If loading a snapshot makes a node temporarily ignore any chain not containing a snapshot block, maybe that is a useful feature if the chain with more work turns out to be invalid.\r\n- Could help in an eclipse attack? If headers or blocks after the snapshot block were withheld, this could temporarily stop the node from syncing to a undesirable fork excluding the snapshot block that seemed to have more work.\r\n- [Maybe other reasons? Personally I'm more inclined towards the first approach, and have a weak understanding of things like forks and eclipse attacks, so I'm struggling to think of advantages to this approach.]\r\n  \r\n### Questions\r\n\r\nAs long as the most-work header chain includes the snapshot block, there should be no real differences in behavior between the two approaches described above. But if the most-work header chain doesn't include the snapshot block, it raises questions about which approach might be preferable. It also raises questions about what other behaviors we should consider implementing if this state is detected, like warning the user, shutting down, changing sync behavior, maybe adjusting relative priorities of the two chainstates.

And if the peer's best block is more than `BLOCK_DOWNLOAD_WINDOW` blocks away from the current chain, the node will never be able to download enough blocks to reach it and validate it. This means if the snapshot is not on the best chain, the node may be unable to sync to a better chain.\r\n\r\nSuggestion to fix would be:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/src/net_processing.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/net_processing.cpp\r\n@@ -1487,12 +1487,14 @@ void PeerManagerImpl::FindNextBlocksToDownload(const Peer& peer, unsigned int co\r\n         return;\r\n     }\r\n \r\n-    std::optional<int> snapshot_height{m_chainman.GetSnapshotBaseHeight()};\r\n+    // If pindexLastCommonBlock has not been set yet, set it now.

I'd say that in this hypothetical situation, AssumeUtxo is not at the top of the list of our concerns - bitcoin would have far bigger problems.\r\n\r\nWithout a massive reorg, there is the alternative that the snapshot provided was bad somehow. But then (apart from the fact that it shouldn't have been hardcoded into chainparams), it also shouldn't have been loaded in the first place because its header should not have been accepted to our block index with our header DoS protections.\r\n\r\nSo all in all I think that once we've accepted a snapshot, we've made a commitment and have to treat it as part of the best chain, at least until background sync has finished.",

      "body": "re: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29519#discussion_r1635456871\r\n\r\nGood points. My suggested change was premised on the false assumption that the node would be able to seamlessly reorg to the most-work chain. But that's not true because of missing undo data.\r\n\r\nYour philosophical point is interesting. I believe that:\r\n\r\n- Loading snapshots should not affect how nodes come to consensus, it should only affect what order they download blocks, and help them compute the latest UTXO sets sooner.\r\n\r\nAnd you seem to be suggesting:\r\n\r\n- Loading a snapshot should force a node to only consider chains that include the snapshot block and ignore other chains, even if they have more work.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn this PR more specifically:\r\n\r\nWhen I made my suggested change, I was forgetting that we don't have any undo data for the snapshot block and blocks before it, so unfortunately it is not possible for a node to follow the most-work chain when a snapshot is loaded until all the preceding blocks are downloaded.\r\n\r\nGiven this fact, I think the best thing FindNextBlocksToDownload can do when an unvalidated snapshot is loaded is to ignore peers on other chains not containing the snapshot block, until it actually has the blocks and undo data that would be needed to validate other chains. I think the current PR is not exactly doing this though. It looks like it will still download up to BLOCK_DOWNLOAD_WINDOW useless blocks on the peer's chain, starting at the fork point between the two chains, which is not great. It will also _not_  download later blocks after snapshot is validated, when undo data needed to enable a re-org becomes available.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn the broader approach to downloading blocks when a snapshot is loaded:\r\n\r\nI'd agree now that the only sensible block downloading behavior for an unvalidated snapshot chainstate is to only download blocks after the snapshot (due to lack of undo data before then) and ignore any peers whose best blocks don't descend from the snapshot block.\r\n\r\nBut it is less clear which blocks should be downloaded and attached to the older chainstate, and whether it should target the most-work block or the snapshot block. Since d43a1f1a2fa35d377c7a9ad7ab92d1ae325bde3d from #27746 it targets the snapshot block, but was not doing that originally. Comparing the two alternatives:\r\n\r\n- Targeting the most-work block seems like a purer approach that would probably simplify the code and remove special cases, and would also have the benefit of the node syncing to the most-work chain faster, with less wasted work if it the chain turns out to be valid.\r\n  \r\n- Targeting the snapshot block is also very reasonable, and is what the code is doing currently, and guarantees the snapshot will be validated even if it is not used, and could be a practical defense against eclipse attacks, or fork chains that appear to have more work but turn out to be invalid.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn whether we should care about any of this:\r\n\r\nI don't think we need to care about these design choices too much, since everything above is referring to a case we don't expect to encounter, where there is a possibly-valid chain of blocks, not including the snapshot block, that has more work than any known chain including the snapshot block. The only time when we should see this is when there is a major fork with a lot of work behind it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think \"the premise that we could get into this situation should be rejected.\" That seems like it is going too far. We should put some thought into how code will behavior in presence for forks for practical reasons, and also to inform design of the code and to write it in a clean way that isn't full of assumptions and special cases.\r\n\r\nI do think, as long as we are hardcoding snapshot hashes in the source code, we can reject premise that snapshot chainstate turns out to be invalid, and just refuse to run in that case. But the case where the snapshot is valid, but the snapshot block is not on the most-work chain seems different and worth thinking about.",

Tighten the criteria for snapshot acceptance: We could reject loading the snapshot if the snapshot block is not a predecessor of `m_best_header`.

After a snapshot is accepted and we detect that the snapshot is no longer on the most-work chain we know of, we could abort syncing the snapshot, delete the chainstate and go back to normal sync mode.

Since I find the logic in `FindNextBlocksToDownload` / `TryDownloadingHistoricalBlocks` / `FindNextBlocks` rather hard to understand, I would like to reproduce the situation in a test (at least locally, sounds like timing issues could make this hard to include in a PR) to be more confident that this is really how it works, which could take a few days.",
