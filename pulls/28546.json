    "body": "Originally, this PR fixed a wallet migration bug that could cause the watchonly wallet created by legacy wallet migration to have incorrect transaction height values. A different fix for the bug was implemented in #28609, but that PR did not add any test coverage that would have caught the bug, and didn't include other changes from this PR intended to prevent problems from invalid transaction heights.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new asserts to catch invalid transaction heights, which would trigger test failures without bugfix in #28609. This PR also refactors code and adds comments to clarify assumptions and make it less likely a bug from invalid transaction height values would be introduced.",

This TXO set is iterated for balance checking and coin selection preparation, which can still be slow for wallets that have had a lot of activity. This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

As a result, this PR only changes how these transaction are dealt with in memory.\r\n\r\nIn memory `TxStateConflicted` (which only refers to block conflicts) and `TxStateMempoolConflicted` are treated the same, which results in `IsSpent` returning false for an output being spent by a mempool conflicted transaction where it previously returned true.\r\n\r\nA transaction is marked as `TxStateMempoolConflicted` during `transactionAddedToMempool` where any transactions that conflict with the one just added to the mempool are marked as mempool-conflicted if they are not already block conflicted.\r\n\r\nA transaction is unmarked `TxStateMempoolConflicted` when the conflicting transaction is removed from the mempool for any reason other than it being added to a block (because in this case it will later be marked as block-conflicted anyways).\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a `mempoolconflicts` field to the `gettransaction` wallet RPC result.\r\n\r\nBuilds on #27145\r\nSecond attempt at #18600",

That would also solve this problem.\r\n\r\nYes, that would be less fragile than the current approach. Also I'm not sure why the main wallet needs to be created with an empty context anyway. It seems like the best solution would just be to create all the wallets normally and not need to reload any of them.\r\n\r\nI do think the other changes in this PR make sense no matter how this issue is fixed, though.

We already do this for a wallet when it is migrated, but we do not for the new watchonly and solvables wallets that may be created. This PR introduces this behavior, in addition to creating those wallets initially without an attached chain.\r\n\r\nWhile implementing this, I noticed that not all `CWalletTx` metadata was being copied over to the watchonly wallet and so some data, such as time received, was being lost. This PR fixes this as a side effect of not having a chain attached to the watchonly wallet. A test has also been added.",

          "body": "Here is a proposed timeline for the move from legacy wallets to descriptor wallets, and at the same time, bdb to sqlite, culminating with the removal of both legacy wallets and bdb. Even though the wallet type and the wallet storage format are orthogonal to each other, as noted in #19077, I would like to tie them together for the sake of simplicity when it comes to how we make new wallets and the migration of one type to another.\r\n\r\nThe 4 combinations of type and format are: legacy-bdb, legacy-sqlite, descriptor-bdb, and descriptor-sqlite. While all 4 types will be supported, we will primarily deal with legacy-bdb and descriptor-sqlite. Setting `descriptors=True` in `createwallet` (or checking the Descriptors option in the GUI) will always make a descriptor-sqlite. Setting that to `False` will always make a legacy-bdb.\r\n\r\n- [x] 0.21 (late 2020)\r\n  - [x] Initial release of descriptor type and sqlite format. (#16528, #19077)\r\n  - [x] Descriptor type is experimental with a warning as such (#16528)\r\n  - [x] Only legacy-bdb and descriptor-sqlite will be created (#19077)\r\n- [x] 22.0 (mid 2021)\r\n  - [x] Implement descriptor exports (#20226)\r\n  - [x] Legacy type remains default (no pr needed)\r\n  - [x] Introduce `dump` and `createfromdump` wallet tool commands with an additional `-format` option to specify the wallet type (#19137)\r\n    * Users may use `dump` and then `createfromdump` in order to make legacy-sqlite from legacy-bdb\r\n    * Users may use `dump` and then `createfromdump` in order to make descriptor-bdb from descriptor-sqlite\r\n  - [x] If a wallet specified in conf or command line doesn't exist, don't make a wallet and instead warn (#15454)\r\n- [x] 23.0 (early 2022)\r\n  - [x] Change descriptor type to non-experimental (#23002)\r\n  - [x] Change `createwallet` `descriptors` default to `True` (#23002)\r\n  - [x] Change wallet tool `create` `-descriptors` default to `True` (#23002)\r\n- [x] 24.0 (late 2022)\r\n  - [x] Introduce `migratewallet` command to migrate a legacy-bdb to descriptor-sqlite (#19602)\r\n  - [x] For newly created legacy-bdb wallets, warn that they are deprecated and will soon be unsupported (#24505)\r\n- [ ] 26.0 (late 2023)\r\n  - [x] When loading legacy-bdb, descriptor-bdb, or legacy-sqlite wallets, warn that the legacy type and bdb format will soon be unsupported, as applicable. (#27869)\r\n  - [x] Deprecate creating new legacy-bdb wallets #28597 \r\n  - [ ] `migratewallet` bug fixes\r\n    - [x] #28609\r\n    - [ ] #28546\r\n- [ ] 27.0 (early 2024)\r\n  - [ ] Remove `migratewallet` experimental warning #28037 \r\n  - [ ] Reimplement legacy-bdb to descriptor-sqlite migration (maybe as a separate command or in the wallet tool) to be independent of `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` and BDB (#26596)\r\n  - [ ] For `dump`, implement an independent BDB file loader (this should probably be shared with the previous) (#26606)\r\n  - [ ] Stop creating new legacy-bdb wallets (not yet started)\r\n  - [ ] Batch DB Writes (@furszy) (#28574)\r\n  - [ ] GUI: Migrate wallets that are not loaded (not yet started)\r\n- [ ] 28.0 (late 2024)\r\n  - [ ] Stop loading legacy-bdb, descriptor-bdb, legacy-sqlite wallet entirely. Inform users how to migrate (not yet started)\r\n  - [ ] Remove `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` except for the independent migration stuff (not yet started)\r\n  - [ ] Remove BDB except for independent loading for migration stuff (not yet started)\r\n\r\nAdditional improvements that have no target deadline:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Run `--legacy-wallet` and `--descriptors` tests in a single invocation of a functional test case  #20892\r\n- [ ] Caching to improve performance of migrated non-HD descriptor wallets (also perf improvement in general) #26008\r\n- [ ] Backwards compatibility tests fixes for descriptor wallets #28027\r\n\r\nThe migration code will probably be around for a long time/forever.\r\n\r\nNote that we expect users who go through the effort to make a legacy-sqlite or descriptor-bdb wallet to suck it up and deal with the consequences of doing something that isn't really supported. Such users should be able to figure out for themselves how to migrate their wallets. (Maybe `migratewallet` can migrate legacy-sqlite to descriptor-sqlite. bdb to sqlite is way easier than legacy to descriptor).",

Also dropped commit cdd66441a0dddefe566da480a7015dbae299b4bb which is no longer neccessary after #28609.\r\n\r\nAlso updated title and PR description since the original bug was fixed #28609, and now this PR is just adding asserts and cleanup to prevent related bugs. Original description was:\r\n\r\n>**bugfix: watchonly wallets created after migration have incorrect height values**\r\n>\r\n>During migration, `CWalletTx` objects that no longer belong to the migrated wallet are moved to a watchonly wallet. But because the migrated wallet is offline (has null `m_chain`), the `confirmed_block_height` and `conflicting_block_height` values in these transactions are -1. These values need to be updated before they are moved to the watchonly wallet, because the watchonly wallet is online, and remains loaded after the migration is complete. Not updating these values could lead to the watchonly wallet returning incorrect information and potentially triggering assert failures.\r\n>\r\n>The problem is only temporary since the height values would be refreshed the next time the watchonly wallet is loaded, but it is worth fixing to avoid unpredictable behavior.\r\n>\r\n>Noticed while reviewing #28542, and looking for other cases where negative confirmed_block_height and conflicting_block_height values might be used.\r\n>\r\n>An easy way to test this bug is to revert the bugfix in the second commit. Then the assert added in the third commit will trigger a crash when `getwalletinfo` is called in [`wallet_migration.py`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c9f288244b8d183e09a917025922b99e3368ef78/test/functional/wallet_migration.py#L250)",

      "body": "> Do you think the first commit is still necessary? I'm not seeing a reason for doing it when no other piece of code will use it.\r\n\r\nI think the first commit is useful to make it clear that some of the CWalletTx fields aren't serialized in the wallet and need to be loaded separately from the blocks database, and to have one function responsible for loading them. Otherwise the fields are just set conditionally in LoadToWallet away from the rest of transaction state code. The new function could also be useful in the future if we want to add more fields to transaction objects to improve conflict tracking, or if we want to add features that avoid keeping all transactions in memory. It's also a move-only change that should be easy to review.",
