    "title": "Support for non-immediate periodic tasks with variable runtime",
    "body": "We currently have several threads in Bitcoin Core, and one of them is the scheduler.\r\nThis scheduler takes care of DumpAddresses, MaybeResendWalletTxs, MaybeCompactWalletDB, CheckForStaleTipAndEvictPeers and ValidationInterface.\r\nIt's good idea to have a scheduler because it allows to avoid the memory overhead caused by having a dedicated thread per task.\r\n\r\nIt is currently unclear what are the expectations of the tasks the scheduler takes care of.\r\nFor example, if there's a way to externally fill the queue for seconds, one could influence wallet rebroadcast timings and deanonymize those transactions.\r\n\r\nOne issue I personally faced is integrating [periodic DNS caches updates](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18421), a task which sometimes might take more than a minute, and there seem to be no trivial way to bound the runtime.\r\n\r\nOne way to make it work, and to make the time bound expectations more explicit:\r\nadd a separate scheduler to take care of all non-immediate tasks, which may take longer than 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nBesides DNS cache updates, this may be relevant to other features in the future, or allow making the existent features heavier. We can also move DumpAddresses there: it can't be time-analyzed, but can possibly take long (if I/O is slow and a lot of entries), and is fine with waiting an extra minute. I believe it can also be relevant for the utxo snapshot creation from [assumeutxo](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606) project?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we expand the existing single scheduler with a functionality which allows to set an upper bound on the runtime of tasks it executes, and/or switch between tasks (I don't know how yet, but that should be doable).\r\n\r\nI'm interested in your opinions!",

This PR increases `ConnectBlock` speed by retrieving coins from disk on a separate thread before `ConnectBlock` is reached. When a block is passed into `ProcessNewBlock` it is immediately warmed before prevalidation checks are begun.\r\n\r\nBenchmarking IBD with `-prune=10000` and default `-dbcache` from blocks `600000-633000` gives a 7.1% increase in speed. Since this is only really useful when blocks take a long time to prevalidate, benchmarks from genesis only give a 2.3% increase. However, this should keep increasing as more large blocks get mined, so it will be even more useful in the future. Of course this will be less useful with high `-dbcache` values.",

          "title": "Periodically update DNS caches for better privacy of non-reachable nodes",
          "body": "Every time a fresh Bitcoin Core node starts, it makes a DNS query to learn about nodes in the network. This process leaks the privacy of those new nodes: every required DNS server and the corresponding infrastructure would be aware that a new node was spinned up in a particular internet segment.\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to reduce the number of those actors learning about a new node.\r\nThe way to achieve it is to keep DNS server caches updated, so that new nodes rarely hit anything past the early servers.\r\n\r\nTo keep them updated, every reachable node would periodically make all widely used DNS queries, thus, triggering DNS cache updates on the resolvers appearing on their path to the end DNS servers.\r\nThis, obviously, would leak more information about the existence of these reachable nodes. We think this is no big deal, because those nodes are already easy to find, since they are reachable.\r\n\r\nNote that this helps only to those private nodes, which share a subnet with some reachable node running this code.\r\n\r\nIn future, it would be great to analyze the results of those queries against a local AddrMan to check for anomalies.\r\n\r\nThe idea was originally proposed by Greg Maxwell.",
