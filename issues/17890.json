(Note: #17887 is not a fix for this issue. #17887 makes the impact much smaller by fixing a separate blow-up bug, but it does not address re-flushing re-opened rev files.)\r\n",

          "body": "The blk files have blocks written to them as they come in. Each blk file and rev file reference the same blocks, but the order in which block data is written into the rev (undo) files is in order of activation, i.e. in block height order.\r\n\r\nThus, when the code decides to stop writing into blk000X.dat, it will flush this and rev000X.dat, and then move to X+1. The problem is that since blocks are activated later than they are stored in the block file, we will still be writing to rev X for awhile after this.\r\n\r\nThis code fixes this by simply finalizing the *previous* undo file each time we finish up a block file. This pretty much guarantees that we will never pre-allocate space and never flush for an undo file (which is happening right now).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for anyone with affected machines, there will be wasted drive space for each rev file if they did IBD before this fix. Probably affects all architectures.\r\n\r\nEdit: note that this PR initially added a new critical section for undo pos and some other stuff, but I scratched that for this simpler solution, hence practicalswift's comment below.\r\n\r\nFixes #17890.",

          "body": "Fixes #17890. Replaces #17892.\r\n\r\nData files (`{blk|rev}<number>.dat`) pre-allocate space as they are written, and then trims down to the final size once they move on to the next sequence (\"finalized flush\"). The code currently assumes (incorrectly) that blk and rev files finish at the same time, but because blk files are written as blocks come in, and rev files are written in block height order, rev files end up being written to for awhile after moving on to the next block file, resulting in pre-allocation and waste of up to 1 MB of space per rev file.\r\n\r\nThe exact point at which rev file writing finishes is the highest height block found inside the corresponding block file, which is already available in the CBlockFileInfo vector. This PR moves finalized flushing of undo files to to directly after the undo data for the previous block file has been written.\r\n\r\nThere is a branch with annotation that demonstrates how this is handling flushing here: https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/tree/200124-rev-files-annotated",
