    "title": "contrib: Automation for Bitcoin Full Node Deployment",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\r\n\r\nI followed the [Bitcoin Full Node installation guide](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node). While the guide is thorough, it lacks automation, which can lead to human errors and platform compatibility issues during manual deployment.\r\n\r\nI propose adding an automation contrib for seamless deployment and maintenance of a Bitcoin full node. This will help eliminate manual errors, improve consistency across environments, simplify the overall process, and reduce the time and effort required for setup and maintenance.\r\n\r\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\r\n\r\nYes, this issue is related to the problem of manual setups and their failure risks.\r\nManual setup is useful to understand the step-by-step setup process, but it is no longer reliable in production environments.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n1.  **Docker**: Docker image for Bitcoin Core binaries. I started [here](https://github.com/0xawaz/bitcoin/tree/0xawaz_docker/contrib/docker). I would love feedback before converting it to a PR.\r\n3.  **Ansible Playbooks**: Ansible playbooks to setup instance, install dependencies, build docker image and run bitcoin core container. We want to support bare metal and cloud instances.\r\n4.  **Monitoring System**: Prometheus/Grafana monitoring system to monitor Bitcoin Node metrics and health.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI automated the setup for myself, as the manual setup wasn't convenient. I want to share it with the bitcoin community.\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\nI read [contribution policy](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b21ba081be89a6716cce91d8a01b8c0abe9c77a3/CONTRIBUTING.md). I am not sure if this is the right repo for this contribution, if so, I am happy to start creating related PRs, if not, please direct me where I can share it with bitcoin community :)",

      "body": "Thanks @maflcko for pointing out docker discussions I missed. I took some time to walk through all the discussions. It just got me more confused. I am genuinely curious to understand what's happening. So I am asking few questions:\r\n\r\n- **Docker**\r\n  - Since we all agree that we need an official docker image for Bitcoin Core, what all PR attempts fail to consider?\r\n  - My understanding is Dockerfile maintenance is one of the main concerns, could you elaborate more? Do you need more hands in the team or do you need us to adapt to the Bitcoin Core build environment and CI/CD process?\r\n  - To be able to succeed where previous attempts failed, I will need to dig more in the code, CI/CD workflows, and tricky blind spots I need to consider ... Will you be willing to provide me with more information about your concerns and experience with Dockerfile attempts integrations? (I would suggest a more elaborate and patient conversation, to be able to cover all that we need, let's avoid prematurely aborting this conversation, communication can be tricky for some of us :D )\r\n\r\n- **Ansible/Monitoring:** I agree, tooling preferences/ideologies are a thing now, I am agnostic, I adapt, my questions:\r\n  - What tooling do you, Bitcoin core devs, and community support for system provisioning?\r\n  - What tooling for monitoring?\r\n  \r\n",

      "body": "> Regarding Dockerfile, I believe it can be considered part of Bitcoin Core Software, as a Bitcoin Core user I need it and I can see through the discussions that many need it, could someone enlighten me of what is needed to start accepting Dockerfile as part of Bitcoin Core Software? What are your requirements?\r\n\r\nNo one is holding anyone back from opening a pull request to add a container engine imagefile. Not sure how much actual interest is there, given that no one has done so far, or the previous attempts were seemingly abandoned?\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think everything has been said in all previous discussions of this topic over the past decade, so I don't think it makes sense to re-hash everything every two years. I'd doubt that there are any points that have not been previously discussed, but if there are, feel free to ask.",
