    "body": "So far, discouragement of peers triggers when their misbehavior score exceeds 100 points. Most types of misbehavior increment the score by 100, triggering immediate discouragement, but some types do not. This PR makes all increments equal to 100 (meaning any misbehavior will immediately cause disconnection and discouragement), and then removes the logic to track the score entirely.\r\n\r\nThis simplifies the code a bit, but also makes protocol expectations clearer: if a peer misbehaves, they get disconnected. There is no good reason why certain types of protocol violations should be permitted 4 times (howmuch=20) or 9 times (howmuch=10), while many others are never allowed. Furthermore, the distinction between these looks arbitrary.\r\n\r\nTo assess whether this does not unduly affect existing other software on the network, I've been running this with an additional patch (see https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commits/202403_nomisbehave_log) that adds logging whenever behavior is detected whose misbehavior increment is changed by this PR. Over the past day I have not seen any instances on my well-connected node (~150 incoming connections), but will continue to monitor.\r\n\r\nThe specific types of misbehavior that are changed are:\r\n* Sending us a `block` which does not connect to our header tree (which necessarily must have been unsollicited). [used to be score 10]\r\n* Sending us a `headers` with a non-continuous headers sequence. [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us 10 (*) separate BIP130 headers announcements that do not connect to our block tree [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 8 headers in a single `headers` message (which thus does not get treated as a BIP130 announcement) that does not connect to our block tree. [used to be score 10]\r\n* Sending us more than 1000 addresses in a single `addr` or `addrv2` message [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 50000 invs in a single `inv` message [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 2000 headers in a single `headers` message [used to be score 20]\r\n\r\nI believe that none of these behaviors are unavoidable, except for the one marked (*) which can in theory happen still due to interaction between BIP130 and variations in system clocks (the max 2 hour in the future rule). That only still only triggers after 10 violations, but we could consider increasing that number, or not treating it as misbehavior entirely.",

Being able to check that the `misbehavior_score` of a peer has increased as expected seems a better approach.\r\n\r\nFrom an end-user perspective, being able to check whether a peer has been misbehaving also seems useful.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

          "title": "Broadcast own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections",
          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* Independent improvement (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29419):\r\n  * `log: deduplicate category names and improve logging.cpp`\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",
