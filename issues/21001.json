    "body": "When running the fuzz tests under `-fsanitize=integer` I stumbled upon this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncoins.cpp:114:22: runtime error: unsigned integer overflow: 0 - 96 cannot be represented in type 'unsigned long'\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e31af1065e8a4a9dbb294e980047a135d4233962/src/coins.cpp#L111-L114\r\n\r\nNote that `cachedCoinsUsage` is decreased despite being zero which causes it to wrap around. This in turn makes `CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage` start returning bogus values.\r\n\r\nNothing high priority of course, but perhaps worth fixing? :)",
