Leaving only the background sync thread creation there and nothing else.\r\n\r\nHaving that solved, and regarding the topic of matching production thread structure:\r\nI don't see why unit tests in general should replicate the complete production behavior or precisely match the thread model used in production. Furthermore, none of these tests really concern themselves with concurrency; they simply start the index sync thread and wait for it to finish before proceeding, effectively running the task synchronously.\r\n\r\nI mean, I'm also ok if we simply rise the timeout but, at the same time, I don't think that the background threads creation adds any meaningful test coverage here.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nOn a slightly unrelated note and going a bit further over the topic, I think that the app's threading decisions should not be part of the index class. In other words, threads should not be owned and managed by each index object. It is not a responsibility that indexes should have. Instead, indexes should sync purely based on external events.\r\n\r\nAnd actually, by separating the threading concerns from the index class, we can optimize a high amount of redundant work currently performed by indexes. For instance, there is no need to traverse the entire chain and read every single block from disk in each of the index threads. We could have just one thread dedicated to reading blocks from disk, while an event dispatcher class notifies all existing indexes. Or.. even better, there could be multiple threads, reading different ranges of blocks at the same time, and dispatching events asynchronously to the indexes (this idea is related to #26966, and it's something I intend to pursue after #24230).",
