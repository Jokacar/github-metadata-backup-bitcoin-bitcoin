          "body": "This change drops `shutdown.h` and `shutdown.cpp` files, replacing them with a `NodeContext::shutdown` member which is used to trigger shutdowns directly. This gets rid of an unnecessary layer of indirection, and allows getting rid of the `kernel::g_context` global.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR tries to improve error handling of `SignalInterrupt` code by marking relevant methods `[[nodiscard]]` to avoid the possibility of uncaught exceptions mentioned https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27861#discussion_r1255496707.\r\n\r\nBehavior is changing In a few cases which are noted in individual commit messages. Particularly: GUI code more consistently interrupts RPCs when it is shutting down, shutdown state no longer persists between unit tests, the stop RPC now returns an RPC error if requesting shutdown fails instead of aborting, and other failed shutdown calls now log errors instead of aborting.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a net reduction in lines of code, but in some cases the explicit error handling and lack of global shutdown functions do make it more verbose. The verbosity can be seen as good thing if it discourages more code from directly triggering shutdowns, and instead encourages code to return errors or send notifications that could be translated into shutdowns. Probably a number of existing shutdown calls could just be replaced by better error handling.",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [x] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick). [DONE, see [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/research-into-the-effects-of-a-cluster-size-limited-mempool-in-2023/794/1)]\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add duplicate transactions to the mempool (#29990).\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts. Is this a problem?",

          "title": "kernel: Handle fatal errors through return values",
          "body": "Based on #25665.\r\n\r\nCurrently functions issuing fatal errors call the `fatalError` notification method to issue a shutdown procedure. This makes it hard for higher level functions to figure out if an error deeper in the call stack occurred. For users of the kernel it might also be difficult to assert which function call issued a fatal error if they are being run concurrently. If the kernel would eventually be used by external users, getting fatal error information through a callback instead of function return values would also be cumbersome and limiting. Unit, bench, and fuzz tests currently don't have a way to effectively test against fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThis patch set is an attempt to make fatal error handling in the kernel code more transparent. Fatal errors are now passed up the call stack through `util::Result<T, FatalError>` failure values. A previous attempt at this by theuni always immediately returned failure values if a function call returned a failure. However, this is not always desirable (see discussion [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27866#discussion_r1256378064)). Sometimes, further operations can still be completed even if a fatal error was issued. The solution to this is that these \"ignored\" errors are still moved through `util::Result`'s error string values with its `.MoveMessages` method, even while a failure value in the result is not present.\r\n\r\nNext to some smaller behavior changes, the most significant change is that the issuing of a shutdown procedure is delayed until a potential fatal error is handled as opposed to immediately when it is first encountered. Another effect is that potential fatal errors are now asserted in the bench, fuzz and unit tests. Some of the currently not immediately returned fatal errors need some further scrutiny. These are marked with a `TODO (fatal error)` comment and could be tackled in a later PR.\r\n\r\nTo validate this approach a new clang-tidy check is introduced. It implements the following checks:\r\n\r\n1. If a function calls another function with a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` return type, its return type has to be `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` too, or it has to handle the value returned by the function with one of `CheckFatal`, `HandleFatalError`,\r\n`UnwrapFatalError`, or `CheckFatalFailure`.\r\n2. In functions returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` a call to a function returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` needs to propagate the value by either:\r\n   - Returning it immediately\r\n   - Assigning it immediately to an existing result with `.MoveMessages()` or `.Set()`\r\n   - Eventually passing it as an argument to a `.MoveMessages()`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587) and is a step towards stage 2, creating a more refined kernel API.",

          "title": "Fee Estimation via Fee rate Forecasters",
          "body": "### This PR aims at improving Bitcoin Core fee estimation\r\n\r\n\r\n### The objectives of this improvement are to:\r\n\r\n- Reduce overestimation done by the current `CBlockPolicyEstimator`\r\n- Make the fee estimator aware of the state of the mempool, allowing it to respond to changing conditions immediately.\r\n- Empower node users to be self-sovereign and use their node's estimates, as is now, the majority rely on third parties for fee estimation.\r\n- Simplify the process of adding new fee estimation strategies in the future.\r\n\r\nThe PR creates a new `FeeEstimator` class which is responsible for getting estimates from one or more subscribed `Forcaster`'s.\r\n\r\nA `Forcaster` will register with the `FeeEstimator` as being able to provide estimates, and when an estimate is requested, should return two fee rate estimates (high and low) and a confidence level.\r\n\r\nThe estimator will then take (currently undecided):\r\n1. the lowest estimated rate, or\r\n1. the weighted average of all the estimated rates\r\n\r\n...and return the two 'high' and 'low' estimations to the user.\r\n\r\nThe `FeeEstimator` also owns access to the legacy estimator, accessible via a pointer.\r\n\r\nThis PR deliberately does **not** try to modify existing fee estimation code, but instead uses new modules with cleaner seperation. This will make new code and interfaces much easier to introduce, and also make it easier to, if desired in the future, drop legacy estimation code.\r\n\r\n### Currently, this PR implements two forecasters:\r\n\r\n1. Mempool-based forecaster (`MemPoolForecaster`): It estimates fees simply by generating a block template from the node's mempool and returns the 25th and 50th percentile mining scores as low-priority and high-priority fee estimates, respectively.\r\n1. Last 6 Blocks forecaster (`BlockForecaster`): Uses the transactions from the previous six blocks _which were also seen in the node's mempool_, to make an estimate.\r\n\r\n    It listens to the validation interface notifications for removed mempool transactions, linearizes the transactions using a mini miner, and saves the 25th and 50th percentile mining scores. When estimating fees, it averages the mining scores of the percentiles from the last six mined blocks.\r\n    \r\n    NB. As this **excludes** transactions that never entered the node's mempool, it's likely to undershoot slightly\r\n\r\nThese two forecasters both estimate fees for (1, 2) block confirmation targets, referred to as \"as soon as possible (ASAP)\" fee rate estimates.\r\n\r\nFor both forcasters use of RBF is strongly recommended in order that transactions can be fee-bumped if desired.\r\n\r\n### Next steps:\r\n\r\n- Give some statistics of estimates \"missing the block\" (~percentage of estimates below the 5th percentile mining score of the confirmed block) and \"over paying\" (~percentage of estimates above the 25th 50th and 75th percentiles mining score) \r\n\r\n- Extend the feature to the wallet; currently it's only exposed in an RPC `estimatefee`.\r\n- Update forecasters to return confidence levels in their estimates.\r\n\r\n### Confidence levels\r\n\r\nConfidence levels are determined by heuristics.\r\n\r\nFor the mempool-based forecaster:\r\n\r\n- Suspected high mining score transactions should be confirmed but aren't.\r\n- Most transactions in previously mined blocks were in our node's mempool.\r\n- High mining score mempool transactions are confirmed.\r\n\r\nFor the last 6 blocks forecaster:\r\n\r\n- Presence of empty blocks in the last 6 blocks.\r\n- Most of the last 6 blocks' transactions were seen in the node's mempool or not.\r\n\r\nThe fee estimator  will select the fee rate from the forecasters based on confidence level instead of just taking the lowest fee rate estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How does this fit in with `CBlockPolicyEstimator`?\r\n\r\nThis fee estimator owns the legacy `CBlockPolicyEstimator` and does not change any of its interfaces. The wallet still uses `estimatesmartfee`, and RPCs also access it through the Fee Estimator.\r\nHowever, this will change when we switch to using estimates from `GetFeeEstimateFromForecasters`, which works much better than the `estimatesmartfee` in (1, 2) confirmation target scenarios.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when we have another forecaster that supports confirmation targets beyond (1, 2) and works better than `estimatesmartfee`, we will eventually phase out `CBlockPolicyEstimator` as the new Fee Estimator module makes it easy to do so.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses two open issues and has been requested by users in the past.\r\n\r\n#27995\r\n#30009\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n1. **Will miners broadcast high fee rate transactions, and then evict them with a conflicting transaction in the next block, trick users of this fee estimator into making transactions with high fees?**\r\n   https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/6?u=ismaelsadeeq\r\n\r\n   This PR addresses this concern by ensuring that the fee estimate does not surge immediately whenever this happens the mempool based forecaster estimate will be higher than last 6 block forecaster estimate. As such the last six blocks forecaster estimate will be returned, preventing users to be victims of this attack.\r\n\r\n2. **In times of high confirmation times or high block space demand, fee estimates tend to rise. If the mempool-based forecaster estimate rises, the fee estimator will fall back to the last six blocks fee estimate, if it's low, will that make transactions constructed with the estimate get stuck in the mempool?**\r\nThe ASAP fee estimate provides an estimate for transactions to confirm in the next one or two blocks. During periods of high confirmation times, fee rates rise due to congestion. Once a block is mined, the mempool clears high mining score transactions, making room for lower fee rate transactions. If congestion recurs and the transaction is time-sensitive, users can safely fee bump assuming it's an RBF-enabled transaction.\r\nIn times of immediate high block demand, if the mempool-based fee estimate surges while the last six blocks fee estimate is low, users can fee bump their transactions if they take longer to confirm. As more blocks are mined, the last six blocks forecaster will adjust and reflect the higher fee rates. When demand decreases, the mempool forecaster will immediately respond to the new conditions by providing a lower fee estimate and the fee estimator will return it instead.\r\n\r\n3. **Currently, getting a block template is expensive. How do you tackle that in the mempool-based forecaster?**\r\nThe forecaster cache the recently generated fee rate estimates and only generate a new block template when the time delta between the recent estimate and the current time exceeds 30 seconds.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is a collaborative work with @willcl-ark and a result of collecting insight from other contributors.\r\n",

I used that opportunity to change the branch name, which makes testing against [SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) slightly easier. There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #30200\r\n- [ ] #29295\r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #30205\r\n\r\n### Related useful issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] #30209\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",
