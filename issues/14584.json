    "title": "Return \"all\" from scantxoutset",
    "body": "`scantxoutset` allows to retrieve UTXOs matching certain criteria, based on a whitelist of desired \"addresses\" (in a wider sense).  However, as far as I see there is no way to use this command to retrieve the full UTXO set via the JSON-RPC interface.\r\n\r\nI think that such a functionality would be useful for certain (non-mainstream) applications.  For instance, block explorers, building rich lists and processing coin snapshots.  I've seen multiple situations (and also done it myself) where applications like that either had to hack Bitcoin Core itself to add a custom-made RPC method for their task or read the full blockchain (rather than just the UTXO set) via RPC calls.  Having the ability to process the full UTXO set by external tools hooking onto the RPC interface would be useful to have.\r\n\r\nOne big caveat with this is, of course, that the full UTXO set is very large and returning it from a single RPC call is probably not a good idea (if it is even possible).  Thus we would need to make `scantxoutset` \"step-able\".  For instance, a new optional argument could specify how many results the caller wants to get at most.  Then the RPC would return those and remain with the operation in a \"paused\" state.  Follow-up RPC calls would be needed to either \"abort\" or \"continue\" the paused scan.   (With \"continue\" returning the next batch of results until the scan is done.)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about such an extension, would that be useful and fit into the general goal for `scantxoutset` (which seems to be wallet support at the moment)?  Is this already possible and I simply missed how to do it?",

(The data itself would be different, but not the general architecture.)\r\n\r\n@laanwj:  Indeed, REST looks like a good interface for that - thanks for the pointer to your PR.  This is not high priority for me (I mainly wanted to check this as a general idea with the community), but I may pick up your PR at some point in the future if I find time for it.\r\n\r\nHowever, by the same argument (\"REST is a stateless request-only interface\"), all of `scantxoutset` and many other RPC calls should be done through REST as well.  RPC and REST are just two complementary interfaces that can both be convenient.  (But I do agree that streaming the entire result through HTTP, if it can be made to work, is an elegant solution that avoids explicit chunking.)",

          "title": "rest: Further API and code cleanup with query parameters",
          "body": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nIn RESTful APIs, path parameters (e.g. `/some/unique/resource/`) are [typically](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/parameters/query/) used to represent resources, and query parameters (e.g. `?sort=asc`) are used to control how these resources are being loaded through e.g. sorting, pagination, filtering, ...\r\n\r\nThe design of the [current REST API endpoints](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md) is quite non-standard in a few ways, I've listed some examples below under \"Undesirable behaviour examples\". Generally, it relies on a number of path (or path-like) parameters that really should be query parameters. Besides being unintuitive for users, I also found the code can be much cleaner when using a generalized interface for query and path parameters. The first work towards this was already done in #24098, but there are still a number of issues outstanding, as e.g. discussed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24098#discussion_r790336549) and [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24098#pullrequestreview-863331148).\r\n\r\n## Suggested changes\r\n\r\nI suggest (and have already prepared the code) to clean up the interface and the code. Besides perhaps the `-deprecatedrest` startup flag, no new user-facing functionality is introduced. Specifically, the relevant proposed changes are:\r\n- introduce a `-deprecatedrest` startup option to allow users to preserve REST endpoint functionality while they upgrade their dependencies, similar to `-deprecatedrpc`\r\n- expand the `HTTPRequest` interface to include easy-to-read functions to access path parameters, like #24098 introduced for query parameters: `HTTPRequest::GetPath()` and `HTTPRequest::GetPathParameter()`. This allows cleaning up the interface quite a bit, including removing the duplicated `strURIpart` that was passed as a third argument to each endpoint (but this is unintuitive and duplicated: the path data is already in the HTTPRequest object).\r\n- further streamline the endpoint URIs:\r\n  - in all endpoints: remove the path-like dot-separated format strings (e.g. `.json`) in favour of a query parameter (`?format=json`), which can default to `json` (especially useful in endpoints that only accept json)\r\n  - use `?from_blockhash=<blockhash>` query parameter instead of a path parameter in `/rest/headers` and `/rest/blockfilterheaders/`, since it is a collection endpoint (multiple resources are returned)\r\n  - deprecate `/rest/block/notxdetails` in favour of a `?txdetails=<true|false>` parameter in `/rest/block`\r\n\r\nThe suggested implementation keeps everything backwards compatible (with the `-deprecatedrest` functions enabled). Even though it means there is a bit more review overhead, I think the tradeoff is acceptable - I did my best to minimize code complexity due to this compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\nThe suggested changes can largely be separated into 4 small-ish PRs (there are some dependencies, so they build sequentially - but shouldn't be too hard to rebase/reorder/leave things out). I have released the PRs as draft already, just to make it easier to look at the proposed changes.\r\n\r\n1. #25753\r\n1. #25754\r\n1. #25755\r\n1. #25756\r\n\r\n## Discussion questions/notes\r\n\r\nI've already written most of the code, but before fleshing out the PRs I'm first looking to get some feedback on the general concept and approach.\r\n\r\nA couple of notes/things to discuss:\r\n- the LoC change is quite significant, is this a wortwhile upgrade?\r\n- should we maintain backwards compatibility with `-deprecatedrest`, not have backwards compatibility at all, or hide the backwards compatibility from the user?\r\n- `-deprecatedrest` is documented to, like the RPC, operate on a per-endpoint basis. However, since the first PR (format string) affects all endpoints, I thought that would not be user-friendly and instead opted to group them by functional change. Going forward, since we now have a rather extensible interface with the query parameters, I expect we'll use `-deprecatedrest` on a per-endpoint basis indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Undesirable behaviour examples\r\n\r\n- Require the user to explicitly define parameters where only 1 value is allowed anyway. For example, `rest/chaininfo/` only accepts `json` as a format but throws if we do not explicitly define `json` to be the format\r\n- [duplicate `deploymentinto` endpoints required](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25412#discussion_r927815259)\r\n- Unnecessary code coupling in [`ParseDataFormat()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c991132b0437b737502ae1f18480e00f84430b72/src/rest.cpp#L134-L157) where we need one function to get the entire query path and then magically remove the format string (e.g. `.json`) from it and return it separately.\r\n- Two different endpoints to support the [`notxdetails`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rest.cpp#L944-L945) option in `/rest/block`, this could just be one endpoint with an optional default query parameter\r\n- APIs can now be upgraded in a backwards-compatible way more easily, since query parameters are named and thus do not rely on position and can be optional\r\n\r\n",
