    "title": "RPC: `getblockstats` might not return the *effective* percentile fee rate",
    "body": "\r\n\r\nOne of the responses from the `getblockstats` RPC is `feerate_percentiles`, which returns the following:\r\n```zsh\r\n\"feerate_percentiles\": [    (json array, optional) Feerates at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile weight unit (in satoshis per virtual byte)\r\n  n,                         (numeric) The 10th percentile feerate\r\n  n,                         (numeric) The 25th percentile feerate\r\n  n,                         (numeric) The 50th percentile feerate\r\n  n,                         (numeric) The 75th percentile feerate\r\n  n                          (numeric) The 90th percentile feerate\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, the implementation simply appends the fee rates of all transactions in a block along with their corresponding weights to a vector, and then returns the percentile fee rates.\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ffe4261cb0669b1e1a926638e0498ae5b63f3599/src/rpc/blockchain.cpp#L2027-L2030\r\n\r\nHowever, the fee rate of a transaction at a given percentile may not reflect its *effective* fee rate, as it could be fee-bumped by some descendant transactions.\r\n\r\nTo address this, transactions within a block that are not independent should first be linearized using an ancestor-based linearization algorithm, for example using `MiniMiner`. This approach would be similar to what's done in #30079.\r\n\r\nNote: MiniMiner will change alot due to #30289, which introduces a new form of linearization. While I assume linearization will still be supported in `MiniMiner` for mempool transactions, I'm unsure about support for linearizing non-mempool transactions.\r\n\r\nA more efficient approach would be to persist previous block package data. With this approach, I don't see any reason to support linearizing non-mempool transactions in `MiniMiner` for now. While this would increase resource usage, I believe the trade-off is justified when compared to the complexity of linearizing clusters on the fly.\r\n\r\nHaving this package data available from disk would be very helpful for both this issue and #30079.",
