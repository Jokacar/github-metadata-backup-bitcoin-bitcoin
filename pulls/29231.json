This PR skips flushing to disk those blocks that already have a known position in the datastore. Skipping this means that users can write-protect the `blk` files on disk which may be useful for security or even safely sharing that data between multiple bitcoind instances.\r\n\r\n`FindBlockPos()` may also flush the undo data file, but again this is skipped if the corresponding block position is known, like during the initial stage of a reindex when block data is being indexed. Once the block index is complete the validation mechanism will call `ConnectBlock()` which will save undo data at that time.\r\n\r\nThe call stack looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninit()\r\nThreadImport() <-- process fReindex flag\r\nLoadExternalBlockFile()\r\nAcceptBlock()\r\nSaveBlockToDisk()\r\nFindBlockPos()\r\nFlushBlockFile() <-- unnecessary if block is already on disk\r\n```\r\n\r\nA larger refactor of this part of the code was started by mzumsande here:  https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/tree/202207_refactor_findblockpos including this fix, reviewers can let me know if the changes should be combined.\r\n",

          "title": "Improve new LogDebug/Trace/Info/Warning/Error Macros",
          "body": "Improve new LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(),  LogWarning(), LogError() macros introduced in #28318:\r\n\r\n- Make them consistent, now all accepting the same parameters.\r\n- Make them all accept log categories, to make it possible to filter or highlight log messages from a particular component.\r\n- Make them compatible with wallet logging, which includes the wallet name in log messages.\r\n- Make them not rely on a global LogInstance, to provide better control of logging in controlled environments, such as unit tests that want to selectively capture log output, or libbitcoinkernel applications that want to have multiple instances of validation objects without mixing their log output.\r\n- Make them less verbose by not requiring category constants to be specified in individual log prints.\r\n\r\nAn [overview](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0cd1616d47e61e125eb3e573573c0c56fba6b775/src/logging.h#L293-L332) of the macros can be found in the logging header.\r\n\r\n### Problems this PR attempts to solve\r\n\r\nThe new log macros in introduced #28318 are generally great. They allow writing code that is succinct and clear, and make it a lot easier to figure out what log levels are being used. Unfortunately, the new macros are slightly less general than than needed to be used throughout the codebase. Particularly:\r\n\r\n1. The new macros cannot be used conveniently in wallet code because wallet log prints are supposed to automatically attach wallet names to log messages.\r\n2. The new macros cannot be used in libbitcoinkernel code because they do not allow specifying a logger instance.\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, the only alternative approach to solving these problems would be to reimplement these macros outside the logging framework so they could be used by wallet and validation code. This PR just takes the approach of slightly generalizing these macros so they work everywhere.\r\n\r\n### Note to reviewers\r\n\r\nI'd encourage looking at the description and code changes in this PR to evaluate it and try to come an independent judgement before looking at the discussion history. Unfortunately and regrettably, I made some dismissive comments on the previous PR, so the discussion here starts out immediately heated.\r\n\r\nA summary of the disagreement is that ajtowns believes allowing log syntax `LogDebug(m_log, \"debug message\\n\")` is [harmful](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29256#issuecomment-2085586513) if log category is part of the `m_log` argument instead of being an explicit category constant. I think omitting the explicit category constant is not a big deal, cuts down on verbosity and repetition, and allows important features like logging to different instances, and automatically adding other metadata (like wallet filenames) to log messages. Other parts of the discussion refer to earlier versions of the PR, go down various tangents, and make the argument that this PR is unnecessary, not that it is harmful.",

          "body": "Fixes #27744\r\n\r\nSince #27278 we log received headers. For compact blocks we also log which peer sent it (e5ce8576349d404c466b2f4cab1ca7bf920904b2), but not for regular headers. That required an additional refactor, which this PR provides.\r\n\r\nMove the logging from validation to net_processing.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces the number of log entries (under default configuration) per compact block header from 3 to 2: one for the header and one for the connected tip.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces a new helper method `LogBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a _compact block_ we call `LogBlockHeader` from the exact same place as where we previously logged. So that log message doesn't change. What does change is that we no longer _also_ log from `AcceptBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a regular header(s) message, _we only log the last one_. This is a change in behaviour because it was simpler to implement, but it's probably better anyway. It does mean that if a peer sends of a bunch of headers of which _any_ is invalid, we won't log it (here).\r\n\r\nLastly I expanded the code comment explaining why we log this. It initially only covered selfish mining, but we also care about peers sending us headers but not following up (see e.g. #27626).\r\n\r\nExample log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:21Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:23Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223098 tx=848176824 date='2023-06-05T13:11:49Z' progress=1.000000 cache=6.4MiB(54615txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z Saw new cmpctblock header hash=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223112 tx=848179461 date='2023-06-05T13:13:58Z' progress=1.000000 cache=7.2MiB(61275txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:41Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 peer=8\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:42Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 version=0x2db3c000 log2_work=94.223126 tx=848182944 date='2023-06-05T13:14:35Z' progress=1.000000 cache=8.0MiB(69837txo)\r\n```",

          "body": "Add `util::Result` support for returning more error information and make use of it in [LoadChainstate method](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665/commits/93af79a1aae9ad483e8ee38ad63f0256464e7153) as an initial application. Followup PR [#25722](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25722) uses it more broadly to return errors and warnings from wallet loading functions as well.\r\n\r\nThis change adds two major features to the result class:\r\n\r\n- For better error handling, adds the ability to return a value on failure, not just a value on success. This is a key missing feature that makes the result class not useful for functions like `LoadChainstate()` which produce different errors that need to be handled differently [^1].\r\n\r\n[^1]: Ability to return error values was actually present in the original implementation of [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218), but unfortunately removed in later iterations.\r\n\r\n- For better error reporting, adds the ability to return warning messages and multiple errors, not just a single error string. This provides a way for functions to report errors and warnings in a standard way, and simplifies interfaces:\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -virtual std::unique_ptr<Wallet> loadWallet(const std::string& name, bilingual_str& error, std::vector<bilingual_str>& warnings) = 0;\r\n    +virtual util::Result<std::unique_ptr<Wallet>> loadWallet(const std::string& name) = 0;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options, DatabaseStatus& status, bilingual_str& error);\r\n    +util::Result<std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase>, DatabaseError> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options);\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThis change also makes some more minor improvements:\r\n\r\n- Smaller type size. `util::Result<int>` is 16 bytes, and `util::Result<void>` is 8 bytes. Previously both were 72 bytes.\r\n\r\n- Broader type compatibility. Supports noncopyable and nonmovable success and error types.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives & design notes\r\n\r\nThe main goal for the `util::Result` class is to provide a standard way for functions to report error and warnings strings. The interface tries to make it easy to provide detailed error feedback to end users, without cluttering code or making it harder to return other result information. There have been multiple iterations of the design using different internal representations and providing different capabilities:\r\n\r\n|   | Representation (approximate)                   | Notes |\r\n|---|------------------------------------------------|-------|\r\n| _1_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Original #25218 implementation in da98fd2efc1a6b9c6e876cf3e227a8c2e9a10827. Good capabilities, but larger type size. Supports error standardized error reporting and customized error handling with failure values. |\r\n| _2_ | `variant<T,bilingual_str>`                | Final #25218 implementation in 7a45c33d1f8a758850cf8e7bd6ad508939ba5c0d. No support for returning failure values so not useful in many cases.\r\n| _3_ | `variant<monostate,T,F>`                 | Pending #25601 implementation that allows choosing whether to use standardized error reporting or return custom failure values, but doesn't support having both at the same time, like approaches _(1)_, _(4)_, _(5)_, _(6)_ do. |\r\n | _4_ | `tuple<variant<T,F>,bilingual_str>`      | Original #25608 implementation in c29d3008de9314dd463ed08e8bff39fe55324498. Basically the same as _(1)_ except it uses separate success and failure types instead of the same type. Using separate success and failure types makes the result class a little less flexible but can help avoid some ambiguity and inconsistent result states. |\r\n| _5_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Final #25608 implementation in dd91f294206ac87b213d23bb76656a0a5f0f4781. Essentially the same as original implementation _(1)_ except has some usability improvements. |\r\n| _6_ | `tuple<T,unique_ptr<tuple<F,bilingual_str>>` | Pending #25665 implementation (this PR). Supports returning failure values, uses separate success and failure types to avoid ambiguity, uses `unique_ptr` to reduce result type size, and avoids heap allocation in the happy path. |\r\n\r\n### Prior discussions & history\r\n\r\n- _furszy_ introduced a `BResult` class providing a standard error reporting mechanism in [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218). It was renamed to `util::Result` in [#25721](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25721) but kept the same representation and capabilities.\r\n\r\n- _MarcoFalke_ suggested using `BResult` for the `LoadChainstate` function in [#25308 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25308#issuecomment-1181674645). Inability to use `BResult` there due to lack of support for failure values led to initial work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _w0xlt_ wrote a `StructuredResult` class in [#25308](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25601) adding the ability to return failure values but sacrificing standard error reporting, which led to more work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _martinus_ suggested a space optimization in [#25608 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608#discussion_r921049409) that also made it easier to support distinct failure & success types, leading to [#25665](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665) as a replacement for [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).",

Instead of needing to be deferenced twice with `**result` or `(*result)->member`, it only needs to be dereferenced once with `*result` or `result->member`. Also when it is used in a boolean context, instead of evaluating to true when there is no error and the pointer is null, it evaluates to false so it is straightforward to determine whether the result points to something.\r\n\r\nThis PR is only partial a solution to #26004 because while it makes it easier to check for null pointer values, it does not make it impossible to return a null pointer value inside a successful result. It would be possible to enforce that successful results always contain non-null pointers by using a `not_null` type (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24423) in combination with `ResultPtr`, though.\r\n",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [x] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick). [DONE, see [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/research-into-the-effects-of-a-cluster-size-limited-mempool-in-2023/794/1)]\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add duplicate transactions to the mempool (#29990).\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts.

          "title": "kernel: Handle fatal errors through return values",
          "body": "Based on #25665.\r\n\r\nCurrently functions issuing fatal errors call the `fatalError` notification method to issue a shutdown procedure. This makes it hard for higher level functions to figure out if an error deeper in the call stack occurred. For users of the kernel it might also be difficult to assert which function call issued a fatal error if they are being run concurrently. If the kernel would eventually be used by external users, getting fatal error information through a callback instead of function return values would also be cumbersome and limiting. Unit, bench, and fuzz tests currently don't have a way to effectively test against fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThis patch set is an attempt to make fatal error handling in the kernel code more transparent. Fatal errors are now passed up the call stack through `util::Result<T, FatalError>` failure values. A previous attempt at this by theuni always immediately returned failure values if a function call returned a failure. However, this is not always desirable (see discussion [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27866#discussion_r1256378064)). Sometimes, further operations can still be completed even if a fatal error was issued. The solution to this is that these \"ignored\" errors are still moved through `util::Result`'s error string values with its `.MoveMessages` method, even while a failure value in the result is not present.\r\n\r\nNext to some smaller behavior changes, the most significant change is that the issuing of a shutdown procedure is delayed until a potential fatal error is handled as opposed to immediately when it is first encountered. Another effect is that potential fatal errors are now asserted in the bench, fuzz and unit tests. Some of the currently not immediately returned fatal errors need some further scrutiny. These are marked with a `TODO (fatal error)` comment and could be tackled in a later PR.\r\n\r\nTo validate this approach a new clang-tidy check is introduced. It implements the following checks:\r\n\r\n1. If a function calls another function with a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` return type, its return type has to be `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` too, or it has to handle the value returned by the function with one of `CheckFatal`, `HandleFatalError`,\r\n`UnwrapFatalError`, or `CheckFatalFailure`.\r\n2. In functions returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` a call to a function returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` needs to propagate the value by either:\r\n   - Returning it immediately\r\n   - Assigning it immediately to an existing result with `.MoveMessages()` or `.Set()`\r\n   - Eventually passing it as an argument to a `.MoveMessages()`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587) and is a step towards stage 2, creating a more refined kernel API.",

However, this would lead to the behavior of `ConnectNode` being unpredictable when the address was resolved to various ips (e.g. the address resolving to IPv4 and IPv6, but we only support one of them).\r\n\r\nThis patches the aforementioned behavior by going over all resolved IPs until a valid one is found or until we\r\nexhaust them.",

          "body": "Return util::Result objects from all functions that can trigger fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThere are many validation functions that handle failures by calling `AbortNode` and triggering shutdowns, without returning error information to their callers. This makes error handling in libbitcoinkernel application code difficult, because the only way to handle these errors is to register for [notification callbacks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/kernel/notifications_interface.h). Improve this by making all functions that trigger fatal errors return util::Result objects with the error information.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a pure refactoring that returns extra result information from functions without changing their behavior. It's a possible alternative to and subset of #29642, which adds similar return information but also makes behavior changes and exposes a FatalError type.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #25665.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`3ce52fc00a0d` refactor, kernel: Add FlushStatus / FlushResult types](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/3ce52fc00a0d405f006f2e300298ac5e8691546a)\r\n- [`c6bdac1320a2` refactor: Add InfoType field to util::Result](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/c6bdac1320a2de9cd6b4caaa12e5c08e7e7d6723)\r\n- [`e56a36cc7587` refactor, blockstorage: Return FlushResult from flush methods](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/e56a36cc7587610e5dc4cd2a75951b8505c978be)\r\n- [`abd7d3622abc` refactor, blockstorage: Return fatal errors from block writes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/abd7d3622abc3471892549d44432b1a04f10653e)\r\n- [`2c2134443ccf` refactor, blockstorage: Return fatal error from LoadBlockIndex](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/2c2134443ccf2d0b131ce93358c1cfc974f0bbd2)\r\n- [`dceb837707b1` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from FlushStateToDisk](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/dceb837707b1e3b5d6a1a9e8b03a6330b07a79df)\r\n- [`1acf496ebf82` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from mempool accept functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/1acf496ebf821b75d22e1e2de8dd1e254902f8d1)\r\n- [`a39b2cdf4a80` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from assumeutxo snapshot functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/a39b2cdf4a808672b5233f960e881479a0bfad65)\r\n- [`809970373cf5` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from block connect functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/809970373cf53023e79607a9ce8154ce3ac8f330)\r\n- [`901ccdc42910` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from activate best chain functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/901ccdc429105925ed861ab01524c15dce3a6d86)\r\n- [`bbb8fec91d37` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from new block functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/bbb8fec91d37e74bd875ac6c8399cb9c2bee2ea7)\r\n- [`1e29b2eaaff4` refactor, blockstorage: Return fatal error from ImportBlocks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/1e29b2eaaff4b09c0e7db2d5f6d1c4c2147440b6)\r\n- [`f65fa8c91130` refactor, validation: Return more errors from VerifyDB](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/f65fa8c91130931713848a97606d5add0fc9b8c5)",

          "body": "`SaveBlockToDisk` / `FindBlockPos` are used for two purposes, depending on whether they are called during reindexing (`dbp` set,  `fKnown = true`) or in the \"normal\" case when adding new blocks (`dbp == nullptr`,  `fKnown = false`).\r\nThe actual tasks are quite different\r\n- In normal mode, preparations for saving a new block are made, which is then saved: find the correct position on disk (maybe skipping to a new blk file), check for available disk space, update the blockfile info db, save the block.\r\n- during reindex, most of this is not necessary (the block is already on disk after all), only the blockfile info needs to rebuilt because reindex wiped the leveldb it's saved in.\r\n\r\nUsing one function with many conditional statements for this leads to code that is hard to read / understand and bug-prone:\r\n- many code paths in `FindBlockPos` are conditional on `fKnown` or `!fKnown`\r\n- It's not really clear what actually needs to be done during reindex (we don't need to \"save a block to disk\" or \"find a block pos\" as the function names suggest)\r\n- logic that should be applied to only one of the two modes is sometimes applied to both (see first commit, or #27039)\r\n\r\n#24858 and #27039 were recent bugs directly related to the differences between reindexing and normal mode, and in both cases the simple fix took a long time to be reviewed and merged.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to clean this code up by splitting out the reindex logic into a separate function (`AddToBlockFileInfo`) which will be called directly from validation. As a result, `SaveBlockToDisk` and `FindBlockPos` only need to cover the non-reindex logic. ",
