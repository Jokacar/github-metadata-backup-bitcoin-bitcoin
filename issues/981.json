    "title": "general Bitcoin URL handling on Windows",
    "body": "In Windows, the default behavior is that certain protocolls (i.e. mailto) are linked to a certain executable. I setup the bitcoin protocol and linked that to the current 0.6 RC4 Bitcoin-Qt.exe via a Registry file:\n\n---\n\nREGEDIT4\n\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\bitcoin]\n@=\"URL:bitcoin Protocol\"\n\"URL Protocol\"=\"\"\n\"FriendlyTypeName\"=\"Bitcoin URL\"\n\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\bitcoin\\shell]\n\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\bitcoin\\shell\\open]\n\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\bitcoin\\shell\\open\\command]\n@=\"\\\"E:\\Bitcoin\\Client\\bitcoin-qt.exe\\\" \\\"%1\\\"\"\n\n---\n\nAfterwards I used Firefox to browse to: http://blockchain.info/uri \nNow if I click the upper link I'm asked to confirm opening of the Bitcoin-Qt.exe, which starts and offers to add an address + label to my addressbook. So far so good, but another click on that link does NOT use the same running instance, it tries to start a new one, which will fail (same data-dir and same port).\n\nDoes the Win-Installer register a protocol handler?\n\nI'm not sure if that's a bug in the client itself, but at least it would be interesting to know if someone has some thoughts on this.\n\nDia\n",

Only one application can be registered and is listed in the registry, now lets say 2 clients are running with different datadir and port. You click on a bitcoin: Link, what should happen? Which client is the receiver of the URL?\n\nI would say I have one running instance, click a link and the client comes out of the tray or taskbar and shows me the corresponding dialogs.\n",

          "body": "Okay, so my former assumption boost 1.47 would fix #956 was wrong and boost 1.49 did not fix it either. It turns out, that I could recreate the error condition by running Bitcoin-Qt and simply switch of my PC. So there were the 2 orphan files from boost interprocess that cause the problem.\n\nI found out, that no interprocess_exception was thrown, not in qtipcserver.cpp and not in bitcoin.cpp. Next step was to look through the code and the \"create_or_open\" option in the message_queue constructor got my attention. I changed this to create_only and voila there was an exception I could work with. It sais \"file already exists\", which makes sens as there are those orphan files left.\n\nIn the end I introduced a new ipcRecover() function, which is called after catching interprocess::already_exists_error. This function works with the path were the stale message queue file \"BitcoinURL\" resides and checks if the file is there and tries to remove it. If that succeeds the function returns true and ipcInit() is called again. If this fails an error is written to the debug.log.\n\nTest case with 1.47 boost libs:\n- kill running Bitcoin-Qt instance by switching PC of\n- check for stale files, which are there\n- starting the client again with the fix disabled in the code\n- no exception, no log entries and a frozen GUI\n- starting the client again with fix enabled results in a not frozen GUI and normal client operation\n\nLog:\nipcInit - boost interprocess exception #9: File exists.\nipcRecover - old message queue found, trying to remove C:\\ProgramData\\boost_interprocess\\BitcoinURL ...success\n\nI know there are many commits in here, so I would suggest to first only look at the diff and if you are interested in the history of the fix take a look at the commits itself.\n\nAs I only run Windows the Linux / Mac devs should test this code, during our discussion.\n",
