    "title": "Make Transport independent of CNetMessage and CSerializedNetMsg",
    "body": "Currently `class Transport` uses `CNetMessage` in one place:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/62f7f59ff495fbcbfc10c25e97bb0dc032647abf/src/net.h#L278-L285\r\n\r\nAnd `CSerializedNetMsg` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/62f7f59ff495fbcbfc10c25e97bb0dc032647abf/src/net.h#L287-L295\r\n\r\nThis creates a problem in my Stratum v2 Template Provider implementation in #29432 which introduces `class Sv2Transport : Transport`. Because the sv2 noise protocol (#29346) is very similar to BIP324 I simply copied `V2Transport` and modified the state machine a little bit. The test and fuzz code was also very reusable.\r\n\r\nBut the above two methods don't fit because of their use of `CNetMessage` and `CSerializedNetMsg`. Stratum v2 messages (`Sv2NetMsg` in #29432) don't inherit from `CNetMessage` and I don't think they should.\r\n\r\nSo I'd like to refactor `Transport` to just return (decrypted) bytes and have the caller interpret them (as `CNetMessage` or `Sv2NetMsg`).\r\n\r\nAdditionally I'm not sure what to do with the `std::chrono::microseconds time, bool& reject_message` arguments. So far I don't use them in `Sv2Transport`.\r\n\r\n* `reject_message`: in v1 the transport sets this if the checksum fails. In v2 it's used for the v1 fallback, but also for unrecognized msg types. This can be done by the caller after my proposed refactor, so the argument can go away.\r\n* `time`: this is passed into `GetReceivedMessage` by the caller and used to set `msg.m_time = time;`, so can also go away.\r\n\r\nFrom IRC I understand @sipa had some ideas on how to tackle this. I can take a stab at it myself, but if someone else does it I'm happy to review.",

          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. Compared to #28983 it introduces EllSwift in the handshake and fixes various bugs. I used that opportunity to change the branch name, which makes testing against [SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) slightly easier. There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #30205\r\n\r\n### Related useful issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] #30209\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",
