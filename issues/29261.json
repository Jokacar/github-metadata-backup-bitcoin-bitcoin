This way, it's excluded from the production build.\n\n3. **Separate Test Code:**\n   - Consider moving the test-only code to a separate file or section within the codebase. This helps in maintaining a clear separation between production and testing logic.\n\n4. **Dependency Injection:**\n   - If the test-only code is interacting with external dependencies, use dependency injection or mocks during testing to isolate the behavior without affecting production.\n\n5. **Unit Testing:**\n   - Ensure comprehensive unit tests for the production code, including the areas covered by the test-only assumptions. This helps catch issues early and ensures that changes to test-only code don't impact production.\n\n6. **Documentation:**\n   - Clearly document the purpose and scope of test-only code to inform developers about its intended use and limitations.\n\n7. **Code Review:**\n   - When making changes related to test-only code, conduct thorough code reviews to catch any potential issues and ensure adherence to coding standards.",
