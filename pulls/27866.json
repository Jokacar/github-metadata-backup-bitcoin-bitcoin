    "body": "The goal of this PR is to establish that fatal blockstorage flush errors should be treated as errors at their call site.\r\n\r\nPrior to this patch `FlushBlockFile` may have failed without returning in `Chainstate::FlushStateToDisk`, leading to a potential write from `WriteBlockIndexDB` that may refer to a block that is not fully flushed to disk yet. By returning if either `FlushUndoFile` or `FlushBlockFile` fail, we ensure that no further write operations take place that may lead to an inconsistent database when crashing. Add `[[nodiscard]]` annotations to them such that they are not ignored in future.\r\n\r\nFunctions that call either `FlushUndoFile` or `FlushBlockFile`, need to handle these extra abort cases properly. Since `Chainstate::FlushStateToDisk` already produces an abort error in case of `WriteBlockIndexDB` failing, no extra logic for functions calling `Chainstate::FlushStateToDisk` is required.\r\n\r\nBesides `Chainstate::FlushStateToDisk`, `FlushBlockFile` is also called by `FindBlockPos`, while `FlushUndoFile` is only called by `FlushBlockFile` and `WriteUndoDataForBlock`. For both these cases, the flush error is not further bubbled up. Instead, the error is logged and a comment is provided why bubbling up an error would be less desirable in these cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis pull request is part of a larger effort towards improving the shutdown / abort / fatal error handling in validation code. It is a first step towards implementing proper fatal error return type enforcement similar as proposed by theuni in this pull request [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27711#issuecomment-1563561502). For ease of review of these critical changes, a first step would be checking that `AbortNode` leads to early and error-conveying returns at its call site. Further work for enforcing returns when `AbortNode` is called is done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27862.",

As a standalone library the libbitcoinkernel should not have to rely on code that accesses shutdown state through a global. Instead, replace it with an interrupt class that is owned by the kernel context. Additionally this moves the remaining usages of the `uiInterface` out of the kernel code. The process of moving the `uiInterface` out of the kernel was started in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken here uses the notification interface to externalize the existing shutdown code from the kernel library. The `SignalInterrupt` kernel context member is passed by reference to the `ChainstateManager` to allow for the termination of long-running kernel functions and sending interrupt signals.\r\n",

      "body": "Re https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27866#pullrequestreview-1475602374\r\n\r\n> It also seems reasonable that some failed flushes like periodic flushes might not need to be fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThis is a good point, and I did not think of this before. A flush may fail once due to some sporadic error, but may succeed again at a later point in time. I'm still not sure though if it is really correct to ignore the flush error. If we fail to flush, but succeed in writing the block index, and then crash, we might have indexed a block, that has not been synced to disk. It also feels weird that we are currently okay with the block files failing to flush, while the call to `CoinsTip().Flush()` returns early on failure. Can you comment on this rationale?",

          "body": "This PR proposes a clean up of the relationship between block storage and the chainstate objects, by moving the decision of whether to store a block on disk to something that is not chainstate-specific.  Philosophically, the decision of whether to store a block on disk is related to validation rules that do not require any UTXO state; for anti-DoS reasons we were using some chainstate-specific heuristics, and those have been reworked here to achieve the proposed separation.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a bug in how a chainstate's `setBlockIndexCandidates` was being initialized; it should always have all the HAVE_DATA block index entries that have more work than the chain tip.  During startup, we were not fully populating `setBlockIndexCandidates` in some scenarios involving multiple chainstates.\r\n\r\nFurther, this PR establishes a concept that whenever we have 2 chainstates, that we always know the snapshotted chain's base block and the base block's hash must be an element of our block index. Given that, we can establish a new invariant that the background validation chainstate only needs to consider blocks leading to that snapshotted block entry as potential candidates for its tip. As a followup I would imagine that when writing net_processing logic to download blocks for the background chainstate, that we would use this concept to only download blocks towards the snapshotted entry as well.",

In particular, that bitcoind will crash on startup if a reindex is requested but the `blk` files are read-only. Eventually this behavior can be updated with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27039. This PR just commits the test coverage from #27039 as suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27039#issuecomment-1584915782\r\n\r\nBecause root users on some platforms can write to read-only files, the test will expect a different outcome if run as root. To enable this, the test framework was expanded with `is_unix_root()` and the CI script modified to create a non-root user and run the functional tests as that user.",

This PR also drops the last reference to the `uiInterface` global in kernel code. The process of moving the `uiInterface` out of the kernel was started in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636.\r\n\r\nThis pull request contains a subset of patches originally proposed in #27711. It will be part of a series of changes required to make handling of interrupts (or in other words the current shutdown procedure) in the kernel library more transparent and less reliable on global mutable state. The set of patches contained here was originally proposed by @ryanofsky [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27711#issuecomment-1580779869). ",

It could have a great rationale or just be weird like it appears to be.\r\n\r\nI'm less concerned about this PR than I am about #27861, which is treating flush errors as fatal errors when they are not inherently fatal. If code writing to disk fails it could either mean (1) state on disk is corrupt or invalid and can't be recovered from or (2) state on disk is valid but out of date and requires more work to catch up. These cases are inherently different and I think kernel API would benefit off having separate \"flush error\" and \"fatal error\" notifications to distinguish them, regardless of implementation details of current code.",

Maybe your goal is to enhance libbitcoinkernel applications ability to handle and report errors, and my goal is to improve clarify of validation code and find to potential bugs in it. From my perspective, just adding `[[nodiscard]]` to function declarations and `(void)` to call sites along with \"// This error is intentionally ignored because ...\" and \"// This error is currently ignored but might be better to handle by ...\" comments would already be improvements. Maybe that doesn't go far enough though, or is more tangential to what this PR is trying to do.",

This seems to be safe because this `FindBlockPos` function only has one caller, `SaveBlockToDisk`, which only has two callers, `Chainstate::AcceptBlock` and `Chainstate::LoadGenesisBlock` which both seem to handle this error by stopping what they are doing and writing \"Failed to find position to write new block\" log messages. I did not look up `AcceptBlock` and `LoadGenesisBlock` callers but assume they are handling this case reasonably.\r\n\r\nI think existing log messages are vague / misleading, so would suggest adding a new log message here like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nLogPrintf(\"Failed to flush previous block file %05i (finalize=%i, finalize_undo=%i) before opening new block file %05i\", m_last_blockfile, !fKnown, finalize_undo, nFile)`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the benefits are of returning false here. I think unlike the other changes in this commit, this change doesn't help avoid any \"potential write from WriteBlockIndexDB that may refer to a block that is not fully flushed to disk yet\", because this flush call is happening after previous block data has already been successfully written and the database has already been updated.\r\n\r\nI think the clearest and most conservative thing to do would be to drop \"return false\" line in this commit, and only log an error message here. If you think returning false is a good idea, just do it in a followup commit decoupled from the other changes here with a commit message that explains why that is safe / desirable.",

I think it would be great to add a log print here, but if this this code is going to be changed to return false, I think that should happen in a separate followup commit, not combined with other changes here, and have a clear explanation and justification.\r\n\r\nIIUC, this change introduces an inconsistency. For all block data, and for vast majority of undo data, the data is considered to be successfully written if the write call succeeeds regardless of whether syncing and trimming succeeds later. But now with this change, for some small fraction of undo block data, the data will be considered not written if the syncing or trimming fails. And the fraction of blocks this will be true for will be essentially random due to the undo flush heuristic (described in a new [comment](https://github.com/sdaftuar/bitcoin/blob/03dfe04075668aa3b99a5d6d68adfcecffca0593/src/node/blockstorage.h#L129-L139) from #27746)\r\n\r\nI understand that your [goal](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27866#discussion_r1254840912) here is to have libbitcoinkernel functions return more complete error information. I understand that goal is easier to achieve by changing behavior of validation and block storage code and returning early in certain cases. But fundamentally it is not necessary to change behavior of any existing code to have it return more error information. Without returning early, you can always accumulate errors and just return the error code at the end.\r\n\r\nIf returning early makes sense, I think it should be justified in its own terms and done carefully in smaller commits.",

Could we write a test for it? I think it would at least make sense to have a log print that explains the problem that's happening.\r\n\r\nThere are also a *lot* of callers to `FlushStateToDisk` and I haven't looked at all of them to determine if they are handling this correctly. Can you describe what they should be doing, and do you know if they actually are doing it? The commit message says \"no extra logic for functions calling `Chainstate::FlushStateToDisk` is required\" mentioning an \"abort error\", but there is no abort error here, only a \"return false\" so I'm not sure how this is supposed to work.\r\n",
