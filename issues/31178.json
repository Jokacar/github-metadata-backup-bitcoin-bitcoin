      "body": "@ryanofsky Yeah, the context here is exactly `Assume()` calls where the conditions is easily shown to be side-effect free by the compiler. I have been using those fairly liberally (inside production code), because it means free extra checks in fuzzing tests that have no runtime cost, but are simultaneously definitely not going to result in different behavior between fuzz tests and production code (because it's the compiler deciding the condition is side-effect free).\r\n\r\nI think these are very useful to have, but it inherently requires a separate compilation for fuzz tests (or any other testing environment where we'd want them enabled). I see that such a separate compilation has downsides too, but the alternative I think does mean just getting rid of some of the most tight-loop Assumes. I don't think it's practical to prevent those from running by putting a conditional higher up the stack (at least not without introducing a much more significant risk of distinct behavior between production and testing).",

      "body": "After testing this, it does seem like, in practice, the slowdown comes from checking the `g_fuzzing` variable, not from evaluating the assume condition. I don't agree with (or don't understand) Marco's logic that this was neccesarily the case, since before #31093 if the compiler knew evaluating the assume condition didn't have side effects and that result of the assume condition was not used, it would have no reason to evaluate it before #31093, but would need to evaluate it after #31093, so an optimization that would skip evaluating the assume condition when `g_fuzzing` is false could result in a speedup.\r\n\r\nBut in practice, the speedup that comes from doing this is relatively minor. When I run the LinearizeOptimallyExample11 benchmark on master, I get around 1.4 operations per second. With a change to skip evaluating the assume condition when `g_fuzzing` is false, this increases to 1.5 operations per second. But if I revert #31093, it increases to 1.8 operation to second.\r\n\r\nChange I was tested with was:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>diff</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/src/util/check.h\r\n+++ b/src/util/check.h\r\n@@ -41,21 +41,24 @@ T&& inline_check_non_fatal(LIFETIMEBOUND T&& val, const char* file, int line, co\r\n void assertion_fail(std::string_view file, int line, std::string_view func, std::string_view assertion);\r\n \r\n /** Helper for Assert()/Assume() */\r\n-template <bool IS_ASSERT, typename T>\r\n+template <typename T>\r\n constexpr T&& inline_assertion_check(LIFETIMEBOUND T&& val, [[maybe_unused]] const char* file, [[maybe_unused]] int line, [[maybe_unused]] const char* func, [[maybe_unused]] const char* assertion)\r\n {\r\n-    if (IS_ASSERT || std::is_constant_evaluated() || g_fuzzing\r\n-#ifdef ABORT_ON_FAILED_ASSUME\r\n-        || true\r\n-#endif\r\n-    ) {\r\n         if (!val) {\r\n             assertion_fail(file, line, func, assertion);\r\n         }\r\n-    }\r\n     return std::forward<T>(val);\r\n }\r\n \r\n+constexpr bool AbortOnFailedAssume() {\r\n+#ifdef ABORT_ON_FAILED_ASSUME\r\n+   return true;\r\n+#endif\r\n+   if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) return true;\r\n+   if (g_fuzzing) [[unlikely]] return true;\r\n+   return false;\r\n+}\r\n+\r\n // All macros may use __func__ inside a lambda, so put them under nolint.\r\n // NOLINTBEGIN(bugprone-lambda-function-name)\r\n \r\n@@ -76,7 +79,7 @@ constexpr T&& inline_assertion_check(LIFETIMEBOUND T&& val, [[maybe_unused]] con\r\n     inline_check_non_fatal(condition, __FILE__, __LINE__, __func__, #condition)\r\n \r\n /** Identity function.
