When would full-rbf be \"by default\"?\r\n\r\nThis pull-req has nothing to do with Initial Block Download (IBD).\r\n\r\nIt simply changes the default for the `-mempoolfullrbf` option to true/enabled. Previously the default was false/disabled. Users who update Bitcoin Core to a version containing this change would by default propagate and mine full-rbf replacements unless they had chosen to disable full-rbf.\r\n\r\nA significant fraction of the P2P network has already chosen to enable full-rbf, so full-rbf replacements propagate reasonably well. Almost half of pools by hash power has enabled full-rbf, so full-rbf replacements that reach those miners are readily mined, as seen on https://mempool.space/rbf#fullrbf and https://fullrbf.mempool.observer/",

      "body": "On the first line of arguments, I think zero-conf business acceptance have the option to deploy additional full-nodes with good transaction-relay peering to obtain a reasonable view of network mempools, and therefore increase their odds of seeing a double-spend of a confirmation of interest. In practice, zero-conf applications have risk threshold, once those thresholds are reached they will deactivate zero-conf acceptance.\r\n\r\nOn the second line or arguments, mempool consistency with miners is becoming a practical concern in my opinion with the appereance of so-called “transaction accelerators”, as now LSPs can use those out-of-band transaction-relay service to fee-bump their stuck multi-party transactions, and therefore provoke a divergence with the rest of the network. I raised this risk of [“mining income asymmetries due to unequal access in to transaction flows bypassing policies”](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26438#issuecomment-1299522242) in Suhas proposal to remove the mempoolfullrbf option months ago.\r\n\r\nOn the third line of arguments about the enhancement of multi-party funded transactions flows, the original motivation is explained in this [post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-May/003033.html) on the lightning dev mailing list. RBF opt-out allows a counterparty contributing an input to block the confirmation of a multi-party transaction at minimal cost, therefore enabling a liquidity griefing at low-cost (size of the pinning tx * mempool min fee).\r\n\r\nSince then, early Lightning Service Providers deploying dual-funding have raised again the [concern](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-May/003920.html) on the mailing list during May of this year, and how sustained RBF signaling flag opt-out can be an annoying vector of pinning attack. While from my understanding the issue might be solved on the Lightning-side by upcoming deployment of nversion=3 (where full-rbf is implied by the policy regime), this won’t solve the pinning issue for coinjoin multi-party transactions which are concerned too (and this is not sure that we’re deploying nversion=3 for the dual-funding/splicing flows due to package limits size). With that context in mind, full-rbf by default is a welcome deployment for second-layers and multi-party applications.\r\n\r\nOn the deployment schedule, we’re still mid-26.0 schedule, so I think it’s reasonable to land it now (feature freeze scheduled for 2023-10-01 as of today July 24th). This still gives a period of roughly 5 months to zero-conf business and other software that would need to tweak their software.\r\n\r\n37% of the hash power sounds a reasonable demonstration of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem selecting the transaction-relay policy favoring maximization of their mining income strategy.\r\n\r\nSo I’m Concept ACK on this change, I still think this change deserves announcement on the mailing list and usual technical communication channels to warn ecosystem stakeholders impacted by the proposed change.",

The arguments for this include miner incentive compatibility, maximization of fees per block through next-block priority-competition, utility for merchants and consumers, intelligent double-spend risk mitigation, protection of the user space, and optimization of Bitcoin adoption, utility, and activity.\r\n\r\nI apologize for not yet having a reference link with full details of all of my arguments, but I am happy to interact with commenters on any arguments for a full RBF agenda here. I can also alleviate any concerns with current zero-conf acceptance risk mitigation.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate being heard, and having a fair chance to be reviewed and considered.\r\n\r\nI also need time for consideration because I am assisting some merchants and users with understanding how to interface with Bitcoin Core and what is happening, so they can express their support for this PR, and their value of zero-conf being useful as a service. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I am advocating for the Bitcoin network state that has thrived for its entire history so far, and asking that Bitcoin Core avoid steering policy.",

All those transactions were created by my OpenTimestamps calendars, and I can assure you they are full-rbf replacements.\n\nLots more too: https://alice.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/ https://bob.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/\n",

My OTS calendars bump fees repeatedly, increasing the feerate by 1sat/vb with each replacement, starting at approximately the minimum relay fee. Every single one of those replacements is actually a long string of multiple replacements. mempool.space does not maintain replacement data beyond 24 hours or so; if you want to see live replacement data you can do to https://alice.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/ or https://bob.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/ and just click on any of the recently mined transactions to see mempool.space's replacement history data on them. You can also see full-rbf replacements at https://mempool.space/rbf#fullrbf, which I linked above as well.\r\n\r\nPlease delete your comment as it is factually incorrect and misleading. Frankly I'm surprised that you are so unaware of current mempool policies in use by miners that you were unaware of the fact that full-rbf has been widely adopted.",

I don't think that's just a fad at this point. However I'm inclined to wait a little bit longer, e.g. after the v26 release, to see if your observations are maintained and reproduced outside of OTS. The new mempool.space tracking is helpful here.\r\n\r\nIn the release notes we should remind wallet users to not (yet) stop using the RBF flag, because their peers may not reliably relay it.\r\n\r\n[0] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-July/021823.html",

This negative impact could be avoided by simply adding first seen safe rule - ie a trx can be replaced but needs to include the original outputs.\r\n\r\nAt GAP600 we continue to see strong use of our service for BTC we have seen circa 350k unique trx hash per month (over the last 3 months) requested to our platform. Our clients include - Coinpayments, Coinspaid and Changelly. Given the period of Mempool being full we have seen an increase a fee required in order to be approved by our platform for trx. This is not an insignificant use case and one which can be easily maintained as is.\r\n\r\nWe have provided further statistics in the past and direct feedback from Coinspaid CEO with in the mailing list see here - https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-December/021240.html\r\n\r\nWe have not seen any impact of full RBF on double spend rates for our trxs which seems to put in large question the stated figure of 40% adoption by miners at such a rate of adoption we would expect to see a large increase in double spends. We expect once this setting become default this will greatly change the adoption of this service.\r\n\r\nGAP600 model targets not to get it wrong and as such  we are very sensitive to any double spend which we get wrong in predicting as we reimburse our clients. GAP600 is not a payment processor rather services payment processors, merchants and non custodial liquidity providers which service non-custodial wallets. ",

Max also at the time was open to do a call, I can check again now and see if this is still the case and connect you.\r\nThat on its own is enough of a sample to validate our statistics.\r\nI have also spoken to Changelly earlier today and they offered to email pro @ changelly.com and they will be able to confirm GAP600 as a service provider. Also please send me the 1 trx hash you tested and I can see if it was queried to our system and if so offer some info as to why it wasnt approved. Also if you can elaborate how you integrated with Changelly - I can check with them if that area is not integrated with GAP600. \r\nAs the architect of such a major change to the status of 0-conf transactions I would think you would welcome the opportunity to speak to business and users who actual activities will be impacted by full RBF becoming dominant.\r\nAre you able to provide the same i.e emails and contacts of people at the mining pools who can confirm they have adopted FULL RBF ?\r\n\r\n\r\n> Reposting my reply to this identical message on the mailing list:\r\n> On Mon, Jul 31, 2023 at 03:13:19AM -0700, Daniel Lipshitz wrote: This would unnecessarily and extremely negatively impact merchants and users who choose to accept 0-conf while using mitigation tools like GAP600. This negative impact could be avoided by simply adding first seen safe rule - ie a trx can be replaced but needs to include the original outputs. At GAP600 we continue to see strong use of our service for BTC we have seen circa 350k unique trx hash per month (over the last 3 months) requested to our platform. Our clients include - Coinpayments, Coinspaid and Changelly.\r\n> I checked, and Coinpayments and Coinspaid are both merchant processors. I could not find any example of actual merchants using their platform accepting unconfirmed payments. I also could not find any documentation on their websites indicating unconfirmed transaction acceptance. As for Changelly, their website says right on the front that \"With an average transaction speed of 5–40 minutes, we ensure you can swiftly take advantage of market opportunities.\" Obivously, 5 minutes is not an unconfirmed payment. Additionally, I verified myself by doing test transactions with BIP125 disabled and an adequate fee: unconfirmed payments are not accepted by Changelly. As their exchange flow clearly says \"Once BTC is confirmed in the blockchain, we’ll start exchanging it to <coin>.\" You need to provide an genuine example of an actual merchant who accepts unconfirmed transactions as payment, and actually relies on first-seen behavior.\r\n> We have not seen any impact of full RBF on double spend rates for our trxs\r\n> Based on the above findings, this appears to be because you don't actually have any clients who rely on unconfirmed payments.\r\n\r\n",

Also please send me the 1 trx hash you tested and I can see if it was queried to our system and if so offer some info as to why it wasnt approved. Also if you can elaborate how you integrated with Changelly - I can check with them if that area is not integrated with GAP600. \n> As the architect of such a major change to the status of 0-conf transactions I would think you would welcome the opportunity to speak to business and users who actual activities will be impacted by full RBF becoming dominant.\n> Are you able to provide the same i.e emails and contacts of people at the mining pools who can confirm they have adopted FULL RBF ?\n\nFYI I replied to this on the mailing list. It's rather silly to duplicate this\nentire conversation both here and the bitcoin-dev mailing list.\n",

For example, an anti-virus program or other program may scan the file and move it into quarantine, or delete it, or corrupt it.\r\n\r\nWhile the local wallet is expected to re-submit any pending transactions, unrelated transactions may be missing from the mempool after a restart. This may cause fee estimates to be off, or may cause block relay to be slower.\r\n\r\nFix this, similar to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6650, by rolling a random XOR pattern over the dat file when writing or reading it.\r\n\r\nObviously this can only protect against programs that accidentally and unintentionally are trying to mess with the dat file. Any program that intentionally wants to mess with the dat file can still trivially do so.",

The BIP125 flag is a way to distinguish transactions from different wallets, and Chainanalysis certainly makes use of this. Deployment of Full-RBF would eliminate the need for any wallet to set BIP125 flags, allowing all wallets to eventually transition to having identical characteristics.\r\n\r\n> Anyone claiming they are accepting 0-conf bitcoin transaction over internet is spreading FUD and that having full-rbf by default does anything bad to their non-existent payment system.\r\n\r\nFYI I still have not been able to find a single example of an online service that actually accepts unconfirmed transactions in exchange for something of value, relying on first-seen behavior.\r\n\r\nIf someone knows of such a service, they should reply in this thread with the URL.",

When this happens, why wouldn't nodes then reject that second transaction with spent inputs instead of letting it sit in the mempool? Or if nodes can do this, remove the spent input and associated output from the transaction so the rest of the unspent inputs go through as fast as the CoinJoin multiparty Tx fee lets them. Has there ever been discussion of using cryptographic proofs of transactions sent between nodes/wallets to determine if a coin input has already been submitted to the blockchain and using that to reject \"double-spends\" of that coin(unless the transactions are marked for with ability to be replaced)? I'd think that would stop the issue of double spent coins in CoinJoins/multiparty transactions causing it to be stuck in the mempool for a long time",

Version of transaction, which address type are you using, your average(usual) fee and in this case LockTime. \r\n\r\nHaving so many address type is obvious bummer for privacy, which we can't affect that but obviously locktime is something we can do about. \r\n\r\n(not considering pool thing as I don't deeply )\r\n\r\n\r\n#3 Users can't make decision on their own, when they don't understand technology and blockchain, if they understood what are we discussing here they would definitely want rbf by default.\r\n\r\nIt's more comfortable for them, so they can later increase fee, specially when bitcoin congestion happens every few days.\r\n\r\nLike it happened today, better bitcoin-core picking of estimate fee to follow and services should update to automatically update to higher fee in case end-user is waiting more then hour. \r\n\r\nBitcoin is coin that's widely and this is improvement not a feature.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> All of those transactions are taken from my OpenTimestamps calendars. My OTS calendars bump fees repeatedly, increasing the feerate by 1sat/vb with each replacement, starting at approximately the minimum relay fee.\r\n\r\nYes, that is a pretty perfect mechanism if you want to create a false positive for \"full rbf\" when all you're actually triggering is eviction from the mempool due to a change in minfee. For nodes that don't run \"full rbf\", they'll see one of the early transactions, add it to the mempool, then ignore any replacements for a while, until their local minfee drops below the original transaction, at which point they'll accept the first replacement they see. Presuming that takes a while, that replacement will then have a high fee, and be included in their templates. That matches all the examples you gave.\r\n\r\nIt does not match some recent txs mined by antpool, though: eg [b4a8d9...](https://mempool.space/tx/b4a8d9d32c43706ab9ec80955e91cf44fef8f4b557781818486ebb7b8b1238c2) at 17.1sat/vb seems to have been mined in the first block that any of its alternatives paid sufficiently for, and there doesn't seem to be any indication that the minfee should have risen above even the fee of the initial alternative (a6f344845e58d6ef288870b37674942d0505d9ee64f0d289164c3f401be8c086) at 5.98sat/vb (statoshi's graphs indicate a max minfee around that time of 5.6sat/vb).\r\n\r\nAll of the data being linked here (the OTS webpages, fullrbf.mempool.observer and mempool.space) remove that data after at most a couple of weeks which makes it pretty difficult to review. I've made some custom patches to bitcoind to make it easier for me to double check your claims, but that's not convenient or easily reproducible by others either.\r\n\r\n> Please delete your comment as it is factually incorrect and misleading. Frankly I'm surprised that you are so unaware of current mempool policies in use by miners that you were unaware of the fact that full-rbf has been widely adopted.\r\n\r\nInsults and \"delete your comment\" don't make for either scientific or constructive discussion.",

      "body": "> > All of those transactions are taken from my OpenTimestamps calendars. My OTS calendars bump fees repeatedly, increasing the feerate by 1sat/vb with each replacement, starting at approximately the minimum relay fee.\r\n> \r\n> Yes, that is a pretty perfect mechanism if you want to create a false positive for \"full rbf\" when all you're actually triggering is eviction from the mempool due to a change in minfee. For nodes that don't run \"full rbf\", they'll see one of the early transactions, add it to the mempool, then ignore any replacements for a while, until their local minfee drops below the original transaction, at which point they'll accept the first replacement they see. Presuming that takes a while, that replacement will then have a high fee, and be included in their templates. That matches all the examples you gave.\r\n\r\nThose example are just examples: my belief is based on far larger numbers of transactions getting mined by those pools. Notably, OTS sets nLockTime freshly on each transaction, and the nLockTime's of the observed, mined, transactions are all up to date. For example, here's a recent OTS tx mined by Foundry USA, showing that they are *not* mining full-rbf as the transaction mined was broadcast multiple blocks prior: https://mempool.space/tx/585810a208f2141a730f7589ce8484d8bd11a3c3607c471fecf3354d30e6c2cf\r\n\r\nAnyway, for even better examples, on Aug 2nd I updated both calendars to send their initial transactions at significantly above minfee.\r\n\r\n> It does not match some recent txs mined by antpool, though: eg [b4a8d9...](https://mempool.space/tx/b4a8d9d32c43706ab9ec80955e91cf44fef8f4b557781818486ebb7b8b1238c2) at 17.1sat/vb seems to have been mined in the first block that any of its alternatives paid sufficiently for, and there doesn't seem to be any indication that the minfee should have risen above even the fee of the initial alternative (a6f344845e58d6ef288870b37674942d0505d9ee64f0d289164c3f401be8c086) at 5.98sat/vb (statoshi's graphs indicate a max minfee around that time of 5.6sat/vb).\r\n\r\nYes, AntPool has *very* clearly been mining full-rbf for some time now. The supermajority of OTS full-rbf txs are mined by them, which is what you'd expect given their 20% hash power. I haven't tried to measure what % of their hash power has full-rbf turned on. But it's likely high or even 100% as mempool.space shows reasonably close to optimal fees for most txs that do get mined.\r\n\r\nBinance Pool is also clearly mining full-rbf. Examples: https://mempool.space/tx/79e111b3250f1afbf7f9a5ea0fcef32b07131e2f7d46842f0d191b5f73fa755c, https://mempool.space/tx/bd7991006ed12e6139cdad1112130731a0ad37e2766d5e3b71608522455143fc, https://mempool.space/tx/1c880f5c2310e9e043f11cd50b2986982c5afdb138e95f59892fc1eda8d27893\r\n\r\nKuCoinPool: https://mempool.space/tx/0eb8e67ddcda86ee0d7bd24be5e695d07d539c68974168fe82dd7b87471d494f, https://mempool.space/tx/52506bbcb0b7af3beeca68294cf39cf411d16ead225c3369953eb57fe6290915\r\n\r\nPoolin: https://mempool.space/tx/25148aa341911ee12ad25d44f1321ab30ebeb40c0cf04653dce1a19f12b4d914 \r\nEMCDPool: https://mempool.space/tx/dd583a3f1142447e13ffac31c10fc2322c99c1d52a1096546869ee709e70a3fd\r\n\r\nAntPool + Binance Pool already represents 33% of hash power.\r\n\r\n> All of the data being linked here (the OTS webpages, fullrbf.mempool.observer and mempool.space) remove that data after at most a couple of weeks which makes it pretty difficult to review. I've made some custom patches to bitcoind to make it easier for me to double check your claims, but that's not convenient or easily reproducible by others either.\r\n\r\nAll you have to do to double check these claims is to run a well-connected Bitcoin node with full-rbf enabled, and `debug=mempool` set. You can easily see what transactions have been accepted and when via this method by simply grepping your `debug.log` file. To be sure you're seeing all full-rbf replacements, you can use my full-rbf peering fork: https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/tree/full-rbf-v25.0\r\n\r\n> > Please delete your comment as it is factually incorrect and misleading. Frankly I'm surprised that you are so unaware of current mempool policies in use by miners that you were unaware of the fact that full-rbf has been widely adopted.\r\n> \r\n> Insults and \"delete your comment\" don't make for either scientific or constructive discussion.\r\n\r\nIt is productive to delete incorrect and misleading comments once notified, especially in the case where the misinformation is encouraging people to use Bitcoin in a dangerous and insecure way. Your comment was clearly incorrect, and not in a subtle way, and showed a lack of investigation. And as you can easily see in the above discussion, we have a company - GAP600 - denying the reality that a large % of hash power mines full-rbf, while trying to sell a clearly broken service.",

      "body": "More than 2 years ago, the liquidity griefing provoked by RBF opt-out of a counterparty contributing to a multi-party transaction (splicing / dual-funding) was brought on the mailing list in a post intitled [“On Mempool Funny Games against Multi-Party Funded Transactions” ](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-May/003033.html) and it was the main motivation behind the introduction of `mempoolfullrbf` with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25353.\r\n\r\nSince then the liquidity griefing concern in the context of multi-party transaction has been brought by another Lightning developer in the mailing list post [“Liquidity griefing for 0-conf dual-funded txs”](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-May/003920.html) and such use-case patterns is in early deployment phase, and start to have more and more economic volume, it turns out it’s a good tool to address the liquidity management issues Lightning is so often blamed with.\r\n\r\nSince then, and during all the last year conversation about `mempoolfullrbf`, if it should be turned by default, activated at some block-height-encoded flag or remove as an option, to the best of my knowledge no counter-reply has been technically argued on this liquidity griefing concern. That said, if doubts persist, I’m very open to do a real-world exploitation if someone takes the burden of setting a “blue” Lightning infrastructure and communicate back the learnings to the community.\r\n\r\nAccording to this [public data-collection dashboard](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/), the Lightning Network is a network of 4,713 BTC, 16,313 self-announcing nodes and 68,739 publics channels. Quantitative results than anyone running a Lightning node is able to independently verify thanks to the gossip network.\r\n\r\nWith a goal to conciliate multiple use-cases, a technical philosophy has been sketched out “to each use-case its set of policy rules” (iiuc) in a reply to the mailing list post entitled [“On mempool policy consistency”](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021116.html) by a Bitcoin Core developer. I don’t think this philosophy is practical as this is not solving the liquidity griefing issue, even with proposed [nversion=3 changes codes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038/files#diff-97c3a52bc5fad452d82670a7fd291800bae20c7bc35bb82686c2c0a4ea7b5b98R785) as non-rbf signaling nversion=2 are not made replaceable by nversion=3 transactions.\r\n\r\nThere is definitely an ongoing effort to make the mempool policy rules more modular (see #25584) and documented (see #22806) though they have been started years ago, and the main bottleneck is code and review by skilled hands and eyes. I think most of the GH comments from the 28 participants so far (and the 55 ones in #26438 and the 66 ones in #26525) have been “cheap talks”. I don’t think comments like [“I feel the mempool policy rules should be X\"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26525#issuecomment-1320241214) have convincing weight in the technical discussion of a +500$ B decentralized network.\r\n\r\nFrom my viewpoint and communication channels, there is no really steering (in the IETF sense) of mempool policy rules by the Bitcoin Core community, rather dealing with legacy technical debt. `mempoolfullrbf` was not even a subject at the last CoreDev meeting if my memory works well, which is the most “closed-yet-invitation-based-on-technical-proof-of-work” communication channel we have in the Bitcoin development community.\r\n\r\nAiming to roll the ball forward I do have few technical questions for the users running zero-conf in an economic fashion:\r\n- do you have already deployed “fire cut” thresholds if more than X of your incoming on-chain transaction traffic is double-spend ?\r\n- would you consider batch CPFP of incoming zero-conf transaction as enabled by package-relay to deter double-spend ?\r\n- have you privacy-preserving cryptographic proofs (see the [`taproot-ringsig`](https://github.com/jonasnick/taproot-ringsig) proof-of-concept) of the business statements you’re claiming for the past periods ?\r\n- would you consider monitoring miners mempools for double-spend of a given UTXO, think “reverse transaction-accelerator” ?\r\n\r\nThe measurement method of the PR author to justify the change have been called out as “dubious” in the latest [Bitcoin Optech newsletter](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2023/08/09/). In fact I think in a decentralized community where the decision-making process has to be decentralized and auditable, it’s a good methodological advance to see a PR author coming with real-world numbers, even if the methodology is imperfect. I would rather invite the Bitcoin Optech newsletter to inform how someone could re-do the claimed measurement “at home”.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I think the conversation is still a lack of consensus on the mempool policy rules design philosophy in a growing ecosystem of use-cases underpinned by a matrix of incentives and host of different performances. On this very issue, I’m to blame as I’ve never replied to the author of the mailing list thread “On mempool policy consistency” [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021132.html).\r\n\r\nI think the PR can be put as a draft for now by the maintainers as there is no technical consensus on enabling full-rbf by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Let's get this merged and this silly debate over with. Miners and node operators who choose to disable full-rbf still can with a simple configuration change.\n\nA change to a default does not meaningfully simplify mempool policy, which is arbitrary and controlled by individual nodes and as such cannot be meaningfully simplified.\n\nThe arguments for and against throughout this PR still seem to be about full RBF as a concept. Full RBF as a concept is out of the bag and usable. So:\n\nWhat is the benefit (or drawback) to changing the default policy for users' own mempool for them?\n\nThat's all this PR does.\n\nAs far as I can tell its currently a tradeoff between fee efficiency and priority; if I have full RBF enabled, I see higher bids which 37% of hashrate might mine. Bidding against full RBF transactions is less fee efficient, but increases the odds of my being included in the next block. I might lean slightly toward full RBF true because I see a _more_ complete picture of awaiting transactions (if my mempool isn't full and evicting, in which case which txs I'd rather have in my mempool is entirely based on what I'm using my mempool for), but that's not a great argument for making that decision for others.",

Think about this in terms of information: the purpose of a Bitcoin node is to widely distribute information in the form of transactions and blocks.\r\n\r\nFull-RBF miners want to learn about full-RBF replacements. Non-full-RBF miners don't care about full-RBF replacements. But it does them no harm to receive that information: they just ignore it.\r\n\r\nFull-RBF nodes distribute the same information as non-full-RBF nodes: transactions and blocks. But in addition, they also distribute information about full-RBF replacements. So a full-RBF node is compatible with both full-RBF and non-full-RBF miners. While a non-full-RBF node is only compatible with non-full-RBF miners.\r\n\r\nIf 0% hashing power was mining full-RBF you could argue that the full-RBF replacement information was irrelevant. But the fact is, a significant % of hashing power *is* mining full-RBF, so it makes sense to adopt the mempool policy of maximum compatibility: Full-RBF.\r\n\r\n> > This simplification of mempool policy is well overdue. Let's get this merged and this silly debate over with. Miners and node operators who choose to disable full-rbf still can with a simple configuration change.\r\n> \r\n> A change to a default does not meaningfully simplify mempool policy, which is arbitrary and controlled by individual nodes and as such cannot be meaningfully simplified.\r\n\r\nIn the future it will. As I mentioned above, wallets have been moving to taking away the ability to set or unset BIP125, simplifying the user experience. As more miners mine full-RBF, the need for that code diminishes, eventually allowing us to remove it entirely from both nodes and wallets.\r\n\r\nWe do not need to support irrelevant options that no-one actually uses. The fact is, no-one in this thread has been able to come up with a real-world example of a business that actually depends on unconfirmed transactions. The distinction between replaceable and \"non-replaceable\" transactions that BIP125 introduced is thus irrelevant, and we can phase it out.",

You might as well argue that the vast majority of people don't even run nodes, so there's no reason for any node to distribute any transactions or blocks at all.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, nodes that choose to propagate transactions are spreading information around. Spreading the maximal amount of useful information - all replacements, full-rbf or not - is maximally compatible with both full-rbf and non-full-rbf miners.\r\n \r\n> Full RBF is relevant to anybody who has a mempool whose state they care about or rely on, and anyone who has any opinion or need beyond 'maximum' when it comes to relay.\r\n> \r\n> For those, for example, using their mempool to decide transaction fees, there is a difference they may or may not be aware of while full RBF transactions are _mined_ by a (large) minority of hashrate.\r\n\r\nAgain, for the purpose of transaction fees since miners are mining full-rbf, knowing about full-rbf replacements (and thus their contribution to fees) gives you the maximum information.\r\n\r\nOf course, in practice replacements are only a small % of overall fees, so the difference is small.

Sorry, I'm not a big blocker. Were the topic of blocksize to become relevant again, I'd be arguing to _shrink_ it short of something big changing. While we're at it, I agree zero conf is a terrible idea.\r\n\r\nYes, it is a terrible idea. BIP125 bends over backwards to support essentially non-existent \"zero conf\" usecases. Getting rid of BIP125 - adopting full-rbf - fixes that mistake. The only reason why you'd want the BIP125 flag is for the sake of zero-conf. There's no other reason to have a distinction between replaceable and \"non-replaceable\" transactions.\r\n \r\n> > This happens to be a tradeoff between an essentially non-existent class of users, and a much larger group of actual, real world, users who benefit from full-RBF: https://petertodd.org/2023/why-you-should-run-mempoolfullrbf#the-controversy\r\n> \r\n> Users can _already_ benefit from full RBF.\r\n\r\nYes.

The fact is in this entire thread no-one has been able to provide clear, convincing, evidence that this is true. We have a lot of claims. But claims are not evidence of use. If anything, the claims so far are suggestive of fraud. For example it's plausible that the lack of usage of GAP600 is because they offer a service that doesn't actually work, so businesses use them briefly - paying them money - and then quit. GAP600 has even said that they don't even test their own service with real double-spends. Notably, in the example of Changelly given above, they did respond to be and confirmed that they do NOT use GAP600's service for any real customer-to-business use-case. Changelly also confirmed to me that they have never even tested it with a real double spend.\r\n> The measurement method of the PR author to justify the change have been called out as “dubious” in the latest [Bitcoin Optech newsletter](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2023/08/09/).\r\n> First of all, the word \"dubious\" doesn't even appear in the Bitcoin Optech newsletter. Quoting it in such a way is not accurate. Second, all Bitocin Optech actually did was link Andrew Chow's initial comment, which even he admitted was clearly not correct with respect to Antpool.\r\n\r\nShould anyone here (except the author) wish to have a test account of GAP600 please reach out via our site, would be happy to provide. I am also open to have a public call to show and discuss our offering and possibly show live transactions being scored and queried.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the authors commentary this PR is not about full RBF it is about stopping 0-conf.\r\n\r\nThe onerous is not on 0-conf or first seen rule proponents to justify their use cases. The onerous is on the author to show and justify that this PR is so important and value adding that it should be adopted  despite 0-conf use cases and adoption. This has not been remotely shown. \r\n\r\nThe methodology of 37% assessment above is not thorough - a simple test of representative trx count with a time gap followed by a replace trxs would give an initial assessment.  A feature which has 37% natural adoption with in less than a year indicates viral adoption and wouldn't require any lobbying, or default setting to become dominant with in a very short time.\r\n\r\nThe author continues to repeat baseless accusations - these have been responded to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28132#issuecomment-1669514712 \r\n\r\nGAP600 is active business with ongoing clients who value their privacy just like the miners the author quotes above - July 2023 GAP600 serviced  circa 350k unique transaction hashes. I will check directly with Changelly on their feedback, as well as look to asses further information which can be shared publicly. The author does not and can not know all use cases of Bitcoin. \r\n",

      "body": " > You're arguing a logical fallacy here. You might as well argue that the vast majority of people don't even run nodes, so there's no reason for any node to distribute any transactions or blocks at all.\n\nNot at all. I'm arguing that\n\n> the purpose of a Bitcoin node is to widely distribute transactions and blocks\n\nIs false. It's one purpose of some nodes (that they mostly do by default doesn't mean that's a major goal of the people running them), but it's optional, and which transactions get relayed is dependent on all kinds of things, including whether your mempool is currently full. I could shrink my mempool to the minimum size to have a reasonable fee estimate, and stop relaying transactions which are below its floor, but which are absolutely relevant to the rest of the network, for example.\n\n'Maximum relay' doesn't seem to matter anywhere else.\n\nThere are a cohort of Bitcoiners who actively don't want to maximally relay for different reasons. Some are the zeroconf people. Some are people who don't want to relay ordinals. Whether or not you agree with them, it's not the place of core to dictate what their node relays.\n\n> The fact is, nodes that choose to propagate transactions are spreading information around. Spreading the maximal amount of useful information - all replacements, full-rbf or not - is maximally compatible with both full-rbf and non-full-rbf miners.\n\nNo. Nodes relay transactions by default. That is not a choice, and relaying transactions is tightly coupled with having a mempool. Afaict, which transactions get relayed is almost _entirely_ the same decision as which transactions get added to my mempool in core.\n\nGiven my node is _my node_ first, regardless of whether it reduces some ideal (the ideal you are arguing is 'maximum relay'), _my node_ will be configured for _my purposes_, and mempool configuration, again, is a part of that. \n\n> Again, for the purpose of transaction fees since miners are mining full-rbf, knowing about full-rbf replacements (and thus their contribution to fees) gives you the maximum information.\n\nNo, replacements drop the replaced tx out of the mempool. It gives you different information. In the case of full RBF, it presents a transaction which 37% of hash rate might mine _in lieu of_ a transaction which the other 63% might mine. \n\n> Of course, in practice replacements are only a small % of overall fees, so the difference is small. But that difference is in favor of defaulting to full-rbf.\n\nI agree the difference is currently small, but its 'being in favour of default full RBF' is entirely arbitrary. You don't know which is preferable for users, yet you want to change default policy and pick _your_ preferred option.\n\n> The logic that a small minority simply wanting a broken feature to exist forever is reason to keep it.\n\nThis is a massive stretch. Big blockers wanted to increase block size, a consensus change, to not have to think about actual scaling solutions. They wanted to push the cost of 'scaling' onto node runners. \n\nFirst seen is not broken. Of the two available options, it is the one which currently better reflects majority hashrate policy. It can coexist with full RBF indefinitely, and sure, if full RBF sees large scale adoption, first at mining, and then by node runners, a default change might make sense. We aren't there yet. I actually expected us to get there a lot faster; my concern when the flag was merged was that we'd see very quick, very broad miner adoption (given leaving money on the table otherwise), but little user awareness/adoption at which point there's an exploitable information asymmetry in publishing a low fee non-RBF-flagging transaction, waiting a little for propagation, then publishing a competitive fee full RBF replacement to invisibly (to those with no full RBF) outbid others in the fee market. Maybe that's still a valid concern, but given it doesn't seem to have materialised, maybe I'm missing something.\n\n> Yes, it is a terrible idea. BIP125 bends over backwards to support essentially non-existent \"zero conf\" usecases. Getting rid of BIP125 - adopting full-rbf - fixes that mistake. The only reason why you'd want the BIP125 flag is for the sake of zero-conf. There's no other reason to have a distinction between replaceable and \"non-replaceable\" transactions.\n\nThe issue is we have that flag, we have untold numbers of nodes running unknown local policy for unknown reasons. This PR makes a decision for them. I don't think such decisions should be taken lightly, and I simply don't see much _real_ utility in this change.\n\nFull RBF works. It's already accessible. The only potential benefits of this change, as far as I can tell, are:\n- Maybe in the future being able to remove an option node runners currently have without too much fuss. \n- People who want full RBF not needing to configure it.\n\nThe first is a nice-if-it-happens, but actively seeking to reduce options, even options you don't agree with, which have no actual impact on others, doesn't sit right with me.\n\nThe second is honestly a loss, to me. I want people to configure their nodes. I want them to make those decisions themselves. Admittedly that's not a great argument either, but I don't think that minor convenience is any more a compelling reason to change a default, and it's the one being used to justify a change from the status quo without any real evidence for or against that being what users at large actually want. \n\n> Yes. And adopting it by default makes it easier for all users to benefit from it. The fact that a limited version of a good thing exists is not grounds to stop all improvement.\n\nI don't agree it makes things much easier, besides by pretending there are absolutely no trade offs and just making the decision about those trade offs for the user. Which, with the current state of the network, is false.\n\nIf it was just relay, I would probably have already acked. But it _does_ impact your local view of the mempool, and some decisions you might make based on it, in non-obvious ways and I don't like that decision being made for users without good (in my view) justification.\n\nAnyone who _really wants_ full RBF will have enabled it already. This PR gets basically (I suppose it's possible someone could have manually set false in their config) everyone else, whether that's the local policy they would want, if informed and made to pick, or not.",

      "body": "@iBeizsley @Daniel600 I think it's worth noting that what's being argued here is **NOT** any less of a choice for users than disabling full-rbf by default. The decision is made for the user no matter what the default is. Inaction does not equate to not making a decision. It is not possible for a setting to be \"unset\" by default, it must either be off or on.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core's policy has been against transaction censorship; there is a reason why tools like ordisrespector will not and should not make it into the base bitcoin client, no matter how much I or any other bitcoiner supports them. From this perspective, consistent policy that reduces capacity for censorship is the norm, and thus this change which relaxes mempool policy allowing more transactions through should be supported by Core.\r\n\r\nThe ignoring of non-rbf-flagging replacements has never been economically aligned for miners. At any point in time, a sufficiently expensive transaction can and will be mined by miners. This is evident in the presence of numerous \"transaction accelerators\" (direct inputs to their mempools) provided by miners.\r\n\r\nYou are indirectly advocating for a form of transaction censorship, which I personally see as extremely dangerous behaviour.\r\n\r\n@YellowRoseCx \r\n\r\n> Satoshi Nakamoto said having all users of a network run their own node doesn't scale and is similar to every Usenet user running their own NNTP server.\r\n>\r\n> And he recommended \"users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.\"\r\n\r\nIf Satoshi Nakamoto says something and you fall into that appeal to authority, what is to stop you from following any grifter or authoritarian ruler? Bitcoin does not operate based on what someone or someone else says, this assumption is silly. Regardless, most opinions of Satoshi are wildly outdated and frankly come from a place of unfamiliarity with bitcoin. Just because they created it doesn't mean it wasn't still an extremely new technology.\r\n\r\n> Non-mining nodes have no network power unless you're accepting payments through that node, otherwise they can only watch the rules, not enforce them. Miners in consensus create the rules and enforce them. The power comes from voting ability from hashrate.\r\n> \r\n> \"A fully validating node running on a RaspPi does nothing to enforce consensus because miners don't care if you follow their chain or not.\r\n\r\nSure, miners don't care if you follow their chain. In addition, nodes don't care if miners don't follow their rules. There is absolutely no behavior within bitcoin that is going to cause anyone to follow a miner that invents new consensus rules. Believe it or not, when a miner does that, we call these 'shitcoins'.\r\n\r\n> The economic nodes that matter are exchanges, vendors, etc. because their choices dictate default consumer behavior, which overall has a far greater impact on the consensus ecosystem than a non-mining user node.\r\n> \r\n> Fully validating nodes that process no transactions/have no economic activity have no input on the consensus of Bitcoin.\"\r\n\r\nThis is untrue. One's status as a business is entirely irrelevant if they begin running on a fork that is incompatible with bitcoin. How is any of this relevant to this discussion?",

A feature which has 37% natural adoption with in less than a year indicates viral adoption and wouldn't require any lobbying, or default setting to become dominant with in a very short time.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I've reconfirmed my OTS findings with test transactions, showing many examples of 4 different pools mining full-RBF. Re: \"wouldn't require any lobbying\", this pull-req isn't about lobbying. It's acknowledging the fact that miners have adopted full-RBF in significant numbers, and since they have, there is every reason to take advantage of that capability by setting an appropriate default for transaction relaying nodes. Miners who want to continue *not* mining full-RBF replacements are of course able to do so, and it's quite possible that some will, at least initially. Full-RBF relaying nodes are of course compatible with non-full-RBF miners.",

I think it could be interesting to re-do a coordinated full-RBF tests with full-nodes run by a set of independents participants, with debug=mempool enabled to corroborate the observations.

What you said was \"I do have few technical questions for **the users** running zero-conf in an economic fashion\". (emphasis mine) That statement gives the clear impression that you think those users actually exist in non-trivial numbers. Since no-one has provided any hard evidence they do, that's misleading.\r\n\r\nAs for 0-conf channels, none of the actual deployed ones (eg Phoenix) rely on first-seen. Phoenix even sets the BIP125 flag on their LN-related on-chain transactions, and they do _not_ accept on-chain payments without confirmation. If you are aware of another *deployed in production* LN implementation that does, I'd like to know, because that's clearly dangerous and they should stop.\r\n\r\n> > First of all, the word \"dubious\" doesn't even appear in the Bitcoin Optech\r\n> > newsletter.\r\n> \r\n> \"Peter Todd argues that the change is warranted because (according to his measurements, which have been [called into doubt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28132#issuecomment-1657669845)),”. (newsletter #263) and “dubious” definition, see wiktionary entry: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dubious So I think my statement on your statement as represented by Optech was correct.\r\n\r\nMaybe you're missing this because of english not being a first language, but the word \"dubious\" in this context has significantly different connotations, particularly as you were implying that Bitcoin Optech *themselves* had characterized my research as such.\r\n\r\n> > See [[bitcoin-dev] Full-RBF testing: at least 31% of hash power, over at least 4 pools, is mining full-RBF right now](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-August/021890.html) for a re-confirmation of my OTS calendar > findings, including a tool that anyone can easily use to also test full-RBF adoption for themselves.\r\n> \r\n> Seen the post. I think it could be interesting to re-do a coordinated full-RBF tests with full-nodes run by a set of independents participants, with debug=mempool enabled to corroborate the observations. Akin to astronomical observatories to watch volcanology or meteorology phenoma. Maybe with a longer delay than 30 seconds between replacements.\r\n\r\nMy OTS research was done with transactions that were usually much more than 30 seconds between replacements. That research has already been done and clearly shows full-RBF mining. After all, in addition to my transactons, there's plenty of other sources of full-RBF replacements, and plenty of services such as https://mempool.space/rbf and https://fullrbf.mempool.observer/ observing those replacements happening. This isn't an occasional propagation glitch. At this point I believe denying the obvious is harmful, as it misleads people about the risks of unconfirmed transactions.\r\n\r\n> Personally I don’t have time to participate in such observation during the coming weeks, though if there is a mailing list announcement ahead, I’ll do my best to have a well-connected full-node running with debug=mempool to participate in such coordinated and distributed observations of full-rbf double-spends.\r\n\r\nI'll ask you a simple question: do you think *any* miners are mining full-RBF at the moment?",

Not necessarily, but if an \"evil mempool\" concerns you, it certainly applies to full rbf. Every \"stuck\" transaction in the mempool that wasn't marked with RBF has to go to a \"transaction accelerator\" which is certainly an evil mempool if there ever was one. Lets allow all miners the incentives of higher paying transactions and not just the ones that are part of pools that have transaction acceleration services.",

You made the PR, seeking to change a long-standing default value. The onus in on **you** to show us that your PR will not break existing use cases. Forcefully demanding users and supporters of 0-conf/FSS policies to show their data is fallacious shifting of burden of proof. If you don't think these use cases exist, go ahead and prove it.\r\n\r\nProving it is is exactly what I am doing, in multiple ways. For example:\r\n\r\n1. Challenging people to demonstrate actual production use-cases that rely on first-seen mempool policy. People have failed to do that, even companies claiming to offer such services.\r\n2. Proving that [over 31% of hash power is mining full-rbf](https://petertodd.org/2023/fullrbf-testing). Relying on first-seen is obviously nuts when so many miners ignore it. So it's no wonder that people continually fail to provide examples of such use-cases: those use-cases are broken and people have stopped doing that.\r\n3. Demonstrating that services that previously relied on first-seen have stopped doing so.\r\n\r\nIt used to be the case that lots of BTC<->altcoin exchange services would accept Bitcoin with zero confirmations and no KYC. Those services have all stopped doing that because doing so gets you exploited, over and over again. People have lost literally hundreds of thousands of dollars unsuccessfully trying to accept unconfirmed transactions.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Bitrefill used to accept unconfirmed transactions. They've stopped doing that. No doubt because it's just too easy to exploit.\r\n \r\n> Your own views on mempool policies are not infallible. Users of 0-conf/FSS have their own reasons and that itself should be respected. Being dismissive and browbeating others into submission does nothing to support your cause.\r\n\r\nWe are quite willing to discuss mempool policies that attempt to prevent *actual* use of Bitcoin: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28217 (note ACKS by active Core devs) and we have merged similar policies in the past (eg the dust rule).\r\n\r\nEliminating a broken policy that people don't actually use, in exchange for [many other benefits](https://petertodd.org/2023/fullrbf-multiparty-protocols), makes a lot of sense.",

      "body": "> It's pretty simple. What you said was \"I do have few technical questions for the users running zero-conf in an economic\r\n>fashion\". (emphasis mine) That statement gives the clear impression that you think those users actually exist in non-trivial > numbers. Since no-one has provided any hard evidence they do, that's misleading.\r\n\r\nMy statement was only an invitation to those users, if their actually exist in non-trivial numbers, to give provide relevant technical and economic information to the present discussion. From my experience of last year initial `mempoolfullrbf` deployment and some users showing up to defend the status quo (cf. Muun’s [mail](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/020980.html)) more than I expected I think the good communication practice is to give the opportunity and relative time for such potential users to give their say. In matters of Bitcoin protocol upgrades, you never know if the lack of opposition is the lack of opposing users, or the lack of awareness of such existing opposing users.\r\n\r\n> As for 0-conf channels, none of the actual deployed ones (eg Phoenix) rely on first-seen. Phoenix even sets the BIP125\r\n> flag on their LN-related on-chain transactions, and they do not accept on-chain payments without confirmation. If you are > aware of another deployed in production LN implementation that does, I'd like to know, because that's clearly dangerous\r\n> and they should stop.\r\n\r\nI’m not ware of another deployed in production LN implementation / services that does 0-conf channels, though for your awareness zero-conf dual-funding / splicing can be expected to become a real-world usage (cf. Phoenix dev [mail](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-May/003920.html)), where mempool pinning becomes a liquidity griefing. Even if this real-world usage brings risks, I think it’s a reasonable trade-off on the liquidity management dimension.\r\n\r\n> Maybe you're missing this because of english not being a first language, but the word \"dubious\" in this context has\r\n> significantly different connotations, particularly as you were implying that Bitcoin Optech themselves had characterized\r\n> my research as such.\r\n\r\nFor sure it was unclear to me if in this context what was called dubious by Optech, either the measurement methodology, or the outcome of the measurement themselves. I think debating a measurement methodology is always a good conversation to have, history of science is sparked with epistemology controversies.\r\n\r\n> My OTS research was done with transactions that were usually much more than 30 seconds between replacements. That > research has already been done and clearly shows full-RBF mining. After all, in addition to my transactons, there's plenty\r\n> of other sources of full-RBF replacements, and plenty of services such as https://mempool.space/rbf and\r\n> https://fullrbf.mempool.observer/ observing those replacements happening. This isn't an occasional propagation glitch. At > this point I believe denying the obvious is harmful, as it misleads people about the risks of unconfirmed transactions.\r\n\r\nTo be fair I’ve looked on myself on few of those observation devices showing some hints of full-RBF mining after last year initial mempoolfullrbf deployment. I don’t think at that stage it’s an occasional propagation glitch, though to clarify my intent I think it’s valuable to spend time discussing what we think is a proven method to demonstrate phenomena on the transaction-relay network. I don’t think it will be the last time we’ll have as an ecosystem a controversy on policy rules deployment. While I agree on misleaded people not understanding the risks of unconfirmed transactions there will always a trade-off to appreciate between moving forward with a protocol upgrade deployment lacking enough consensus and as such raising more discussion and taking time to build more technical ground and understanding of said protocol upgrade.\r\n\r\n> I'll ask you a simple question: do you think any miners are mining full-RBF at the moment?\r\n\r\nYes and I think from my memory of last year full-rbf transactions propagations simulations, if 10% of the transaction-relay nodes (not mining nodes) are running the flags with true, in practice it might be logically equivalent to the majority of nodes running full-rbf.",

If a service accepts 0-conf, they're never realistically guaranteed to get the coins confirmed even if the double spend protections are put in place. The reason why 0-conf transactions with double spend protections are acceptable on \"contentious forks\" is because they're guaranteed to always be included in the next block and don't have an easy way to double spend the coin like RBF allows\n\nThe problem that RBF is trying to solve could simply be solved by increasing the acceptable  blockweight. This is especially significant with another halvening to occur soon. It would lower the transaction fees, guarantee next-block-confirmation, and allow a scalable income to miners by allowing more transactions and usage rather instead of continuously rising transaction fees that in turn, prevent normal people from using Bitcoin and turning Bitcoin into something only companies and wealthy individuals can afford to use. \nEven if Core's plan is to funnel users away from Bitcoin's network to the Lightning Network, the LN whitepaper states for the BTC network to accommodate the 2016 world population with only 2 transactions per year(opening LN channel and closing LN channel), it would need the equivalent of a 133mb block size. That's not even considering that there will always be individuals or companies who want to make more than 2 transactions per year and are able to pay a higher fee than everyone else, which in turn would cause some people to never have their LN channels open or close, pushing them towards centralized services. Even if we look at 1% of the population making 20 transactions per year, that would need at least the equivalent of a 13mb blocksize per year (not considering those who would pay more to bump some of the people's transactions down)\n          \nReplace by fee is simply a bandaid on a much bigger issue and causes Bitcoin to stray further away from a simple to use, cheap to transact, decentralized electronic cash it was created to be. \n\n<div style=\"width:100%\">\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/80486540/252e0f33-548d-409b-9eed-308bafcc17a0\" width=\"43%\" height=\"auto\"/>\n</div>\n",

(i.e When should we expect 27.0 or 28.0 to released?)\r\n\r\nFor your clarity and wider transparency, to the best of my understanding, we don't have a decision process among the community about mempool policy changes affecting Bitcoin applications in a wide scale fashion, as `mempoolfullrbf` is I believe one of them. I think the best process we might have when such changes are proposed is to dicuss them on the mailing list and other bitcoin public development forum. By experience, it's always a matter of trade-offs.\r\n\r\nPersonally, my position is still the same since 2021, I'm still advocating to turn on RBF by default to simplify multi-party transaction flows as I explained [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-May/003033.html) on the mailing list or it is explained on the PR author blog's [here](https://petertodd.org/2023/fullrbf-multiparty-protocols).\r\n\r\nI thkn we're still stuck on building technical consensus among the community on a transaction-relay policy design philosophy, something I'm still a bit to blame for as I never answered AJ mail of 2022 [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021132.html) on this very subject. I think the same conceptual divergences as showed up again with #28220.\r\n\r\nI'll do my best to draft an in-depth answer to AJ, notably to integrate some recent discovery in matters of policy design trade-offs (cf. [“The Pinning & Replacement Problem Set”](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-November/022111.html) discussion on the mailing list) during the coming years, though if someone else wanna carry on the technical design philosophy discussion to move forward faster, please feel free to do so.\r\n\r\nedited: to add missing hyperlink to AJ post “On mempool policy consistency\"",

(May be viewed as type of censuring)\r\n\r\nThere is a limited bandwidth to relay blocks between nodes you can't scale on blocksize alone and that's why thus far the consensus on how to scale Bitcoin has been through layer 2 solutions. So this entire block is out of touch with the current design philosophy which is to accept payments on second layers and use the first layer to manage and resolve disputes within that second layer.",

      "body": "@Daniel600 \r\n\r\n> At GAP600 to date we have not seen any significant impact of FULLRBF on our service - we have seen circa 2 trxs which affected us, keep in mind we processed Circa 180k unique trx hash in Sept of 2023.\r\n\r\nHave you actually tested full-RBF double spends against your service? Because at the moment, about 40% of hash power is mining with full-RBF enabled. So the chance of a full-RBF double-spend succeeding is approximately 40%.\r\n\r\nAs an example, here in El Salvador the Chivo ATMs accept transactions with BIP125 RBF **enabled** about half the time in my testing, immediately giving cash USD in exchange for a transaction that can be trivially replaced by 100% of miners. Since Chivo ATMs have AML/KYC by virtue of the fact that they require a phone number, which in turn requires AML/KYC to obtain in El Salvador, they are in fact relying on AML/KYC for double spend protection rather than mempool policies.\r\n\r\nIt would not be surprising if you're claimed low rate of double-spends is purely because the services involved are not vulnerable. As I mentioned before, in my discussions with (IIRC) Changelly, they confirmed that they **do not** use GAP600 to secure transactions coming from untrusted sources.",

Because at the moment, about 40% of hash power is mining with full-RBF enabled. So the chance of a full-RBF double-spend succeeding is approximately 40%.\r\n> \r\n> As an example, here in El Salvador the Chivo ATMs accept transactions with BIP125 RBF **enabled** about half the time in my testing, immediately giving cash USD in exchange for a transaction that can be trivially replaced by 100% of miners. Since Chivo ATMs have AML/KYC by virtue of the fact that they require a phone number, which in turn requires AML/KYC to obtain in El Salvador, they are in fact relying on AML/KYC for double spend protection rather than mempool policies.\r\n> \r\n> It would not be surprising if you're claimed low rate of double-spends is purely because the services involved are not vulnerable. As I mentioned before, in my discussions with (IIRC) Changelly, they confirmed that they **do not** use GAP600 to secure transactions coming from untrusted sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nIts not a requirement that our clients perform KYC and in general we dont inquire about it. GAP600 services customers who in most cases do not perform KYC for the trxs they are sending us - these include direct merchants, payment processors and non-custodial liquidity providers. \r\n\r\nIn general non custodial liquidity providers only perform KYC on high risk or on trx above a certain threshold. This is based on recent discussions I have had with some of them. Non custodial liquidity providers partner with non custodial wallets providers and have commercial relationships with them. So I would think that is the above feedback from Changelly is referencing.\r\n\r\nWe have seen double spends on our platform which have been caused by FullRBF and our system has obviously not been able to detect them beforehand - not a significant amount but we have seen them.\r\n\r\nOur service rests on the first seen rule. Based on our experience a trx with confirmed inputs, reasonable fee, not seen conflicting trx for  5-7 seconds - is reliable. Also the trxs do not happen in a vacuum but rather in commercial exchanges with expected characteristics.\r\n\r\nWhy would first seen safe FullRBF i.e requiring at least same outputs as replaced transactions - not be able to achieve the goals of this PR? ",

And you can not set wallet fee rate with `settxfee` RPC above `maxfeerate` value.\r\n\r\n- This PR adds a functional test that ensure the behavior is enforced.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] I have searched for existing issues that already suggest this feature.\n\n### Describe the Feature Request\n\nSince about [90%+ of hashpower](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28132) is mining full-rbf, it makes sense to accept and relay those replacements.\n\n### Describe the Use Case\n\nFailing to accept and relay full-RBF replacements when almost all hash power accepts them decreases the accuracy of mempool fee estimation, and prevents users from learning about relevant transactions that are likely to get mined. This is particularly notable for users who are running block explorers on their Start 9 devices; why block explorer sites like https://mempool.space and https://blockstream.info have supported full-RBF for quite some time now.\n\n### Describe Preferred Solution\n\nJust set `mempoolfullrbf=1` by default; the configuration tool can continue to allow it to be disabled if desired. Bitcoin Core doesn't seem interested in doing this by default — likely politics around how controversial it has been. But there's no reason why we should not do the right thing for users.\n\n### Describe Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

Some of the reasons why users run nodes include self-soverign fee estimation and block explorers: both those use-cases are improved by accepting and relaying common fee-paying transactions that miners do in fact mine, as you have a better understanding of what fees are being paid, and of course, block explorers running on Umbrel devices can show those transactions. Notably, both https://mempool.space and https://blockstream.info switched to running full-RBF quite some time ago to be able to display those transactions.\r\n\r\nUsers of course can continue to turn it off if desired. But on balance I believe the default should be on for typical Umbrel use-cases.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core doesn't seem to be interested in changing the defaults, nor do Bitcoin Core members seem to be interested in explaining why. They already made two releases recently without changing the default, even though a supermajority of hash power have adopted full-RBF. But that shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing for Umbrel users.",

While they aren't of significant hash power, they do in fact do full-rbf for some of their hash power as they give miners an option of picking Knots (full-rbf) or Core (defaults) templates.\n\nAlso, Wasabi is now relying on full-rbf in production: https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/pull/12677\n\ntl;dr: their coordinator assumes that if a double spend is detected of lower fee-rate, the coinjoin will most likely win anyway regardless of BIP-125, so the round should be continued. This improves their resistance against the DoS attack of double spending your output to get a coinjoin round cancelled. They're also running their nodes with full-rbf enabled. Of course, this would all work more reliably if full-rbf was enabled by default.\n\nOn April 16, 2024 9:40:01 AM EDT, orangesurf ***@***.***> wrote:\n>An update to @petertodd's stats from July, at least 97.7 % of hashrate (monthly average) is now running FullRBF based on FullRBF'd transactions from within the past 24 hours. \n>\n>|Miner|Miner Hash (%)|\n>|-----|--------------|\n>|[AntPool](http://mempool.space/tx/c004c39d2d83884397e1ed35ef40a79338adcd32dd68eb23e184d6e14bcf1849)|22.7|\n>|[BTC.com](http://mempool.space/tx/080e59af2e6ad8066bb7bf5ee5ba41675415f4ef906cb99951c6539f26454d4b)|1.7|\n>|[Binance Pool](http://mempool.space/tx/9696ee89cd20b6281d524f1fbd5290b8095e835bb8f55f495f3419750800e7c5)|4.5|\n>|[Braiins Pool](http://mempool.space/tx/a3c98993544f1d389792b10ba564695d1c632f6c9059d2d18878c7dd88c87ad1)|2.2|\n>|[F2Pool](http://mempool.space/tx/493b580376b988dc505b7009128d150123b15a90b6f7901bac080582cd878d47)|13.0|\n>|[Foundry USA](http://mempool.space/tx/3a6535533d6a6cae465492ac0ad64028c3689b81914721e01561d5a1908b8c8d)|28.3|\n>|[Luxor](http://mempool.space/tx/3a12718b2b02a32c309519874fd814405deed1eabc26f80e35bb4a88993ca978)|2.8|\n>|[MARA Pool](http://mempool.space/tx/07190da353b35d6048e9e7006be957f256c73128fe01ee0553b2944459440e50)|2.5|\n>|[Poolin](http://mempool.space/tx/cfa0ccfd08dceab92744d3b6d1627d97419b403686307f5aff61917b433ff4a7)|1.2|\n>|[SBI Crypto](http://mempool.space/tx/badfea6939f4573ab96f85c816d14671a0b7f289d0a121f8138f0931219ce4b0)|2.6|\n>|[SECPOOL](http://mempool.space/tx/45b9592683f91765969c2d4910a3d34447034bc98721de2ef3f3b84b533be01d)|1.4|\n>|[SpiderPool](http://mempool.space/tx/f216f8fe6c9be182277ea24e65a300ca39655726bf9ca383ab055f8311238e15)|1.8|\n>|[ULTIMUSPOOL](http://mempool.space/tx/c4849373a7bb7e5c8d54740aa4b6763fd3331dbc900dc56b783aab200e881ed3)|0.4|\n>|[ViaBTC](http://mempool.space/tx/acb4418e36939958939b6f729b8a73d6aa00c91310fbca46b3b51d2bcb691354)|12.3|\n>\n>\n",
