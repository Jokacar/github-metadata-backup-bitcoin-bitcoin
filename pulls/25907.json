    "body": "It is useful to have a RPC that can create and add the automatically generated descriptors (that are normally made during creation) to a wallet. This is especially useful when a new default descriptor has been implemented as it allows wallets created before that time to quickly and easily add that type of descriptor.\r\n\r\nIn particular, descriptor wallets created before Taproot was implemented can use the new `createwalletdescriptor` RPC in order to get a Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to keep the newly generated descriptor in line with the existing descriptors, this PR uses #26728 as it exposes a \"wallet extended key\" for us (in addition to upgrading wallets implemented prior to have a wallet xpub). The newly generated descriptors will use the \"wallet extended key\" stored in `CWallet` that PR adds.\r\n\r\n`createwalletdescriptor` is generic and so it can also be used with the other address types. Of course, it given the same wallet extended key, address type, and internal-ness, it will create the same descriptor. So some refactoring has been done in order to detect that the same descriptor is about to be created, and to avoid overwriting any existing descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo be able to use `createwalletdescriptor` with the other address types, we need a way to change the wallet extended key, and so `sethdseed` has been updated and enabled for descriptor wallets. As with legacy wallets, when called without parameters, it will generate a new random master key for the wallet. It can also take a xprv and set that as the master key. It still takes a BIP 32 seed as WIF or as hex as we do for legacy wallets. The seed will be transformed into and stored as a BIP 32 extended key. The latter is to give us greater compatibility with other wallets which often produce non-WIF HD seeds.",

          "body": "This PR adds a signature to the encrypted key records (`ckey` and `walletdescriptorckey`) which acts as an additional checksum. The signature is produced by the private key, and signs the encrypted private key data. It is a schnorr signature. The signature is verified when the encrypted key record is loaded, and if it fails to verify then the loading fails with a wallet corrupted error.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of doing this is to mitigate a common scam where users are given/sold a wallet file that contains \"encrypted\" private keys that correspond to several high valued UTXOs. However the \"encrypted\" keys are not actually encrypted, they are just garbage data. The signature allows the wallet to ensure that the private keys for the stated pubkeys was known at the time of encryption, so it should help mitigate this scam by making it harder for scammers to make high value UTXOs appear to be IsMine.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a downgrade attack where the scammer can continue to do this with a wallet that does not have signatures over the encrypted keys. To mitigate this, the user will get a warning when they open a wallet that has encrypted keys without signatures. When the wallet is next unlocked, the signatures will be generated and written to the wallet file.",

Dumping all the information to disk at once atomically at the end of the process.\r\n\r\nThen, for BDB, fixed places where we are flushing to db directly on individual writes. e.g we do it in the in the chain sync/scan process, when an output that belongs to the wallet is found if the address is not inside the address book. \r\n\r\nPlus, in several places across the wallet flows, we create new `WalletBatch` objects.

          "body": "Currently when we load a wallet, we just iterate through all of the records in the database and add them completely statelessly. However we have some records which do rely on other records being loaded before they are. To deal with this, we use `CWalletScanState` to hold things temporarily until all of the records have been read and then we load the stateful things.\r\n\r\nHowever this can be slow, and with some future improvements, can cause some pretty drastic slowdowns to retain this pattern. So this PR changes the way we load records by choosing to load the records in a particular order. This lets us do things such as loading a descriptor record, then finding and loading that descriptor's cache and key records. In the future, this will also let us use `IsMine` when loading transactions as then `IsMine` will actually be working as we now always load keys and descriptors before transactions.\r\n\r\nIn order to get records of a specific type, this PR includes some refactors to how we do database cursors. Functionality is also added to retrieve a cursor that will give us records beginning with a specified prefix.\r\n\r\nLastly, one thing that iterating the entire database let us do was to find unknown records. However even if unknown records were found, we would not do anything with this information except output a number in a log line. With this PR, we would no longer be aware of any unknown records. This does not change functionality as we don't do anything with unknown records, and having unknown records is not an error. Now we would just not be aware that unknown records even exist.",

          "title": "[Draft / POC] Silent Payments",
          "body": "This PR proposes an early version of [Silent Payment](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8) (author:@RubenSomsen).\r\nIn this scheme, the recipient generates a public address, but the sender tweaks the address and the recipient detects the payment by verifying all transactions on the blockchain. An example use case would be private donations.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is not a final version, but to start the discussion and get benchmarks based on a real implementation.\r\n\r\nThis version is built on top of [#994](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/994) (bitcoin-core/secp256k1) for x-only ECDH support and #23480 (bitcoin/bitcoin) for `rawtr()`. Each new silent transaction detected is stored in wallet as a `rawtr()` descriptor. \r\n\r\nIn this implementation, the sender can tweak the recipient address by passing the `silent_payment` option to send RPC. The transaction output will be different from the address entered.\r\n\r\nFor example `./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named send outputs=\"[{\\\"bcrt1pwlh5xuyrpgfunwyww8cfu78yfs2yqyevl7yturavahh5kgxwdd2q5hzgfu\\\": 1.1}]\" fee_rate=1 options=\"{ \\\"silent_payment\\\": true}\"`.\r\n\r\nwill generate `vout` with completely unrelated outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"vout\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 1.10000000,\r\n      \"n\": 0,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(65b19890c5ca40edb816d26f5f48cd9f3ed51121613b1c2405adc1a6dbbc824a)#8myx9tcu\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pvkce3yx9efqwmwqk6fh47jxdnuld2yfpvya3cfq94hq6dkausf9qrfjkgz\",\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 2.02499835,\r\n      \"n\": 1,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(c45cb3d500bbf8f0c8841e8e011b008781d826c16ee348edb822c0f97419bc4d)#26hcce63\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pc3wt84gqh0u0pjyyr68qzxcqs7qasfkpdm353mdcytq0jaqeh3xsuvlykg\",\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny wallet, as long as it has access to private keys, can send silent payments. Thus, this excludes watch-only wallets or wallets with external signers .\r\n\r\nBut the recipient's wallet needs a new flag called `SILENT_PAYMENT`. This flag allows an additional scan that verifies that the wallet keys match the silent payment scheme. When it detects a silent payment that belongs to the wallet, it is stored in a `rawtr()` descriptor.\r\n\r\n`./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named createwallet wallet_name=\"recipient\" silent_payment=true`\r\n\r\nTherefore, scanning each address for each transaction is potentially prohibitive overhead, so the node can be initialized with `keypool=1` or a descriptor with range [0,1] can be imported into a blank wallet. Until there is more benchmark data, it is the safest option. The proposal recommends one static address.\r\n\r\nI've been running some silent payments on signet using wallets with default keypool and default range, I haven't noticed any relevant performance drops on the signet node.\r\nApparently this implementation is working as expected but I can't guarantee that the scheme is implemented correctly or safely, so I'm opening this PR for reviews, modifications and improvements.\r\n\r\nThere is a new functional test (`test/functional/wallet_silentpayment.py`) that can help to better understand the implementation.",

          "title": "wallet, spkm: Move key management from DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan to wallet level KeyManager",
          "body": "This PR changes DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan to no longer handle relevant keys directly. Instead all keys for all DescriptorSPKMs will be handled by a new `KeyManager` class which exists within `CWallet` (a reference to it is passed to each DescriptorSPKM). This allows us to have a concept of a wallet HD key for descriptor wallets. This makes it easier to add new single key descriptors that use the same HD master key as the rest of the autogenerated descriptors (e.g. for taproot). Multisigs will also be easier as an xpub belonging to the wallet can be exported without needing to do weird things like descriptor introspection and guessing about which descriptor's key to use.\r\n\r\n`KeyManager` is a class which handles all of the keys for DescriptorSPKMs. It contains the maps that hold the keys, deals with writing those keys to disk, and handles their encryption. Encryption keys are still managed by `CWallet` but provided to `KeyManager` through the `WalletStorage` interface. Signing is still done through `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan::SignTransaction` however this will fetch the keys from `KeyManager` rather than storing keys in the DescriptorSPKM to be used.\r\n\r\nThis change is backwards compatible. Although `KeyManager` writes and uses keys in new `keyman_key` and `keyman_ckey` records, it will still write keys for each descriptor in `walletdescriptorkey` and `walletdescriptorckey` records. This allows a descriptor wallet created using this change to be opened by 22.0 and 0.21. Additionally, wallets created with older software will automatically be upgraded to using the `KeyManager` at first loading. This is done in the background and does not require any user interaction (i.e. no passphrase required).",

          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",

          "body": "Depends on #26728.\r\n\r\nThis PR expands the wallet RPC `gethdkey` introduced in #26728. It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",

If a wallet has watchonly stuff in it, a new watchonly descriptor wallet will be created containing those watchonly things. The related transactions, labels, and descriptors for those watchonly things will be removed from the original wallet. Migrated wallets will not have any of the legacy things be available for fetching from `getnewaddress` or `getrawchangeaddress`. Wallets that have private keys enabled will have newly generated descriptors. Wallets with private keys disabled will not have any active `ScriptPubKeyMan`s.\r\n\r\nFor the basic HD wallet case of just generated keys, in addition to the standard descriptor wallet descriptors using the master key derived from the pre-existing hd seed, the migration will also create 3 descriptors for each HD chain in: a ranged combo external, a ranged combo internal, and a single key combo for the seed (the seed is a valid key that we can receive coins at!). The migrated wallet will then have newly generated descriptors as the active `ScriptPubKeyMan`s. This is equivalent to creating a new descriptor wallet and importing the 3 descriptors for each HD chain. For wallets containing non-HD keys, each key will have its own combo descriptor.\r\n\r\nThere are also tests.",

This is done in various places, such as `IsMine`, and helper functions for fetching a `ScriptPubKeyMan` and a `SolvingProvider`. This also has a bit of a performance impact on standard descriptor wallets, although less noticeable due to the small number of SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAs these functions are based on doing `IsMine` for each `ScriptPubKeyMan`, we can improve this performance by caching `IsMine` scriptPubKeys for all descriptors and use that to determine which `ScriptPubKeyMan` to actually use for those things. This cache is used exclusively and we no longer iterate the SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAlso added a benchmark for `IsMine`.",

It looks like there's a lot of commits, but **only the last 12 commits belong in this PR**. The rest will be merged with upstream PRs.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).\r\n\r\nBIP324 is [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki).\r\n\r\n### Running a v2 node\r\n#### Get the code\r\n```\r\ngit remote add bip324 git@github.com:dhruv/bitcoin.git\r\ngit fetch bip324\r\ngit checkout bip324/bip324-enable\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Build for your OS\r\n\r\nFollow the appropriate instructions [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md)\r\n\r\n#### Run the node\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoind -conf=CONFIG_FILE -v2transport=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Connect with a friend's v2 node\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -conf=CONFIG_FILE addnode \"FRIEND_IP:FRIEND_PORT\" \"add\" true\r\n```\r\nThe last parameter(`p2p_v2:true`) signals to your node that the peer is running a v2 supportive client and we should attempt to make an encrypted P2P connection (you're simulating the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag advertisement manually). Should that fail however (say because the peer told you mistakenly, lied, etc.), this code will downgrade the connection to unencrypted v1 transport.\r\n\r\n### Things you are helpful to test\r\n\r\n* If your friend's node is a v2 node, you can see with wireshark that the bytes are pseudorandom (the easiest way to confirm this is that with a v1 connection, wireshark will tell you it has detected a Bitcoin connection and it'll even parse out the metadata like message type, etc; with v2, wireshark has no idea -- of course that _could_ be because wireshark does simply not know v2, but it is because the bytestream is pseudorandom)\r\n* Compare the v2 encrypted session id exposed via `getpeerinfo` as `v2_session_id` with your friend.\r\n* Add another peer that is actually v1, but try `addnode` still indicating v2 support. You should see with wireshark that after a failed attempt at a v2 handshake, the connection is downgraded to unencrypted v1 and wireshark can parse it.\r\n\r\nI've been told there are v2 nodes running at (happy to update the list as more people run persistent v2 nodes; message me and I'll add it here):\r\n```\r\nbe.anyone.eu.org\r\nrp7k2go3s5lyj3fnj6zn62ktarlrsft2ohlsxkyd7v3e3idqyptvread.onion:8333\r\njdcoysubtxazi7dketpyb5rnjorvxad4onftveohash2pdwkgw4bvnqd.onion:8333\r\nxci6cphki2pdb5qe7axzrcxcxabkbm24z4zlv2hn4ziy6grquqco2kyd.onion:8333\r\nslvtesfgg3mkksqqzh67al4sq6dx3rhlzqepa4ny7jonzuckg6msf3id.onion:8333\r\ngifm4fnj3vua664xhgeanx5fnpco3txkqy4amr4txbfsciiyrkxpf2qd.onion:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::3:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::a6d6:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1a:365::2:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1b:365:aa20:66ff:fe3f:1909:8333\r\n184.74.240.157:8533\r\n95.179.145.232:8333\r\n```",

          "body": "As we see segwit and taproot usage grow, it seems reasonable to stop making wallets that are able to generate legacy and p2sh-segwit addresses. We have already made it difficult to make legacy addresses through the GUI (starting with `-addresstype=legacy` is the only way). The default address type is bech32. So it seems that we should consider stop automatically generating legacy, and probably p2sh-segwit, descriptors.\r\n\r\nThis would simply be removing the automatic creation of descriptors for the `LEGACY` and `P2SH_SEGWIT` output types for new wallets. We would still retain the ability to spend those outputs, parse those descriptors, and make those types of addresses if the user's wallet has descriptors for these output types. Additionally, if a user wanted to add such a descriptor to their wallet, they could via `importdescriptors`. There can also be some RPC which can add an automatically generated single key descriptor of whatever type that could legacy and p2sh-segwit descriptors to the wallet. Such an RPC would be the generic version of the one that will add `tr` descriptors (or perhaps the same RPC).",

          "body": "@ryanofsky recently suggested that I should write an overview of how the various pull requests spread over different repositories relate to some bigger picture view.\r\n\r\nSee the [multisig tutorial](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multisig-tutorial.md) for how things currently work.\r\n\r\nI typically have the following future multisig wallet in mind to guide my thinking:\r\n1. a computer running Bitcoin Core holding one master key (key 1)\r\n2. one or more hardware wallets with additional keys, via HWI (keys 2 ... n)\r\n3. taproot keypath using n-of-n MuSig2\r\n4. a fallback with fewer keys after some time elapsed\r\n5. a GUI wizard to set this up (simple Python command line tool until then)\r\n\r\nThe descriptors for this could be hand crafted, but it would be nice to have:\r\n6. Miniscript compiler that can generate this\r\n\r\n**What's Missing?**\r\n\r\n- Taproot support for external signers:\r\n  - [x] #22558 (PSBT fields)\r\n  - [x] #23578 (External signer support)\r\n- [x] Timelock support for descriptors: this will be added along with full [MiniScript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) support in #24148 & #24149 (@darosior).\r\n- [ ] Ability to handle descriptors for which we have 1-of-N keys. Descriptor wallets currently expect the wallet to be either watch-only and have no keys, or to have all the keys.\r\n  - [ ] #25907 makes it possible to create a wallet _with_ a seed, but without any descriptors.\r\n  - [ ] The user would grab an xpub from it (#22341 ) to construct a multisig descriptor and then import that.\r\n  - [ ] PR's to move in the right direction: #26728 and #23544 (up for grabs) \r\n- [ ] MuSig2 setup and signing support, which requires:\r\n  - [ ] a BIP to specify new PSBT fields (tracked in #23326)\r\n  - [ ] Bitcoin Core changes; no PR yet afaik, (tracked in #23326)\r\n  - [ ] At least one other (hardware) wallet to support it\r\n      * I'm not aware of any hardware wallet working on this yet\r\n      * testing with two Bitcoin Core nodes is good start\r\n  - [ ] HWI changes: additional commands for:\r\n     - [ ] initial setup\r\n     - [ ] signing (although perhaps calling `signtx` multiple times with the right PSBT will \"just work\")\r\n     * doesn't have to be HWI of course, we would just add support new commands in the [external signer command interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/external-signer.md) \r\n- [ ] a simple Python setup wizard\r\n   * right now [Specter Desktop](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop) is by far the easiest way to setup a multisig wallet. But it's a huge dependency (including a bunch of NPM packages for their web interface). A simple Python script in contrib/ could call HWI to get a list of signers, ask what threshold to use, call `createwallet` to generate a blank wallet, fetch an xpub from it, and then call `importdescriptors`.\r\n   * the script could use [BIP 129 / BSMS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki) (perhaps initially without encryption)\r\n   * Specter doesn't set the external_signer wallet flag, so I have a trivial PR to do that manually: #21928 \r\n- [ ] a GUI setup wizard: once we have an established work flow, we would implement that in the GUI\r\n\r\n**Misc**\r\n\r\nI have a PR that improves address display handling on the device:\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24313\r\n\r\nEven better would be if we had a feature to ask the wallet for a signature to prove it has the private key (without passing that information to the outside world of course, see #24186). This requires BIP-322 support on our end (#24058), at least one hardware wallet to support it, and a new HWI `signmessage` command. Perhaps this can later be expanded to allow your device to prove that it (still) has the keys it needs as a co-signer.\r\n\r\nMiniscript compilers currently doesn't support Taproot (e.g. to find the optimal tree structure), but I'm assuming you can still hand craft a leaf containing MiniScript.

          "body": "Builds on top of #25907 and one commit from #22341.\r\n\r\nFirst this PR introduces a descriptor wallet RPC `addhdseed`. Similar to its legacy wallet counterpart `sethdseed` it either generates a fresh random seed, for use on a blank wallet, or the user can provide a WIF. Unlike `sethdseed` this RPC call does not add keys / fill the keypool.\r\n\r\nThis allows a user to create a blank wallet (`createwallet`), provide it with a seed (`addhdseed`) and then craft custom descriptors. (An alternative approach would to add a `nodescriptors` argument to `createwallet`, but this RPC seems useful anyway)\r\n\r\nAn example use case of this is setting up a multisig between Core and a hardware wallet. After adding the seed to an otherwise empty wallet, the user would call `getxpub m/87'/0'/0'`. They would then combine this `xpub` and origin info with the one from their hardware wallet (e.g. using `hwi --fingerprint .... getxpub m/87'/0'/0'`  and craft a descriptor like `wsh(sorted_multi(2, [...../87'/0'/0']our_xpub, [..../87'/0'/0']their_xpub))`, and import that. The resulting wallet will be able to sign its part of the transaction.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this PR enables to ability descriptors, such as in the multisig example above, in such a way that any `fingerprint` + `xpub` that is covered by our hd seed(s) can be signed for.",

By unifying it with `ReacceptWalletTransactions()` into `ResubmitWalletTransactions()`, the number of callsites that would reset the `m_next_resend` timer increased\r\n  - since `m_next_resend` is only used in case of `relay=true` (formerly `ResendWalletTransactions()`), this is unintuitive\r\n  - it leads to [unexpected behaviour](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25768#issuecomment-1252619427) such as transactions potentially never being rebroadcasted.\r\n  - it makes the ResubmitWalletTransactions()` logic [more complicated than strictly necessary](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25768#discussion_r962828563)\r\n  - since #25768, we relied on an earlier call of `ResubmitWalletTransactions(relay=false, force=true)` to initialize `m_next_resend()`, I think we can more elegantly do that by just providing `m_next_resend` with a default value\r\n  - just to highlight: this commit introduces behaviour change\r\n\r\nNote: the `if (!fBroadcastTransactions)` in `CWallet:ShouldResend()` is duplicated on purpose, since it potentially avoids the slightly more expensive `if (!chain().isReadyToBroadcast())` check afterwards. I don't have a strong view on it, so happy to remove that additional check to reduce the diff, too.",

          "body": "Depends on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27601, please go there first.\r\n\r\nThis work aims to define, and implement a base standard mechanism to\r\ndetect individual change outputs.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nCurrently, the wallet detects whether an output is change or not based\r\non data stored in the address book.\r\n\r\nThere is no notion of “change outputs”, the wallet detects change scripts.\r\n\r\nConnoting that any address book record modification has implications\r\non all the historical outputs related to that particular destination. Meaning\r\nthat all those outputs can either be change or not. There is no middle-ground\r\ngranular distinction.\r\n\r\n#### How Change Detection Currently Works?\r\n\r\nThe wallet walks-through the transaction outputs, extracts the script\r\ndestination and verify the following two points:\r\n\r\n1) If the destination doesn't exist in the address book, then the script\r\n    is a \"change address\".\r\n   \r\n2) If the destination exists in the address book, but it doesn't have a\r\n     label, then the script is a \"change address\".\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are a good number of problems in the current approach:\r\n\r\n- We make the wallet dependent on an external structure, with separate storage.\r\n   Which has to be updated and maintained along with the wallet state.\r\n\r\n- It cannot be maintained nor recovered across different wallet instances.\r\n   Cannot re-create the, possibly custom, address book data only by importing\r\n   the wallet descriptor string.\r\n\r\n- As the address book is an structure that the user can freely modify, the change\r\n   detection process might differ through different wallets.\r\n \r\n- The current rudimentary assumptions of \"no address book entry\" or \"no label set for the address book entry\"\r\n  to denote that certain script destination is change or not can easily be broken:\r\n  E.g. derive an address from one of the wallet’s external paths manually. Then send coins to it.\r\n  As the receive destination wasn't created inside the wallet, the wallet has no associated address book entry.\r\n  So, the reception is invalidly detected as change (added a test case for it).\r\n\r\n- The wallet can't detect change outputs on more complex scripts such as multi-sig change outputs.\r\n\r\n- The wallet is not able to detect change outputs going to an internal address if the internal address has a label.\r\n  (E.g. the user can manually set a label for the internal address and, doing that, make that all the change\r\n  outputs, in the wallet history, that were sent to the destination are no longer detected as change).\r\n\r\n- There isn’t a way to distinguish the external reception of coins into an internal address. Coins reception on any\r\n   internal address are always detected as change.\r\n\r\n### New Change Detection Mechanism Goals\r\n\r\nAiming to:\r\n\r\n* Define a base mechanism to align different wallet implementations. Preventing each piece of software\r\n  from diverging on the basic change outputs distinction.\r\n\r\n* Detect change outputs on-demand without requiring to maintain an external data structure synced with the\r\n   latest wallet state.\r\n\r\n* Independently, and accurately, detect change outputs regardless data stored in structures that the user\r\n   can freely modify.\r\n\r\n* Granular distinction between change vs non-change outputs that were sent to the same internal address.\r\n  E.g. the reception of coins, from an external source, on internal addresses will not longer be detected\r\n  as change anymore.\r\n\r\n* Expand the change detection to more complex scripts such as a multi-sig protected addresses. (While they\r\n  are added into the wallet on an internal spkm)\r\n\r\n#### Change Output Detection Rules\r\n\r\nA transaction output is change if it fulfills the following points:\r\n\r\n1) At least one of the parent transaction inputs is from the wallet. (If none of them are, then the wallet is receiving coins\r\n    on an internal address).\r\n\r\n2) The script extracted destination is from the wallet and is located in one of the internal script pub key manager.\r\n    (e.g. derived from an internal derivation path)\r\n\r\n#### What about legacy wallets?\r\n\r\nIf the legacy wallet is HD post-split, we have an internal derivation path, so we can follow the same process as\r\ndescriptors wallet. Unless the destination is on the pre-split key pool, in which case, we fallback to the follow-up\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nIf the legacy wallet is pre-split, we continue using the address book as we either have an HD wallet with keys\r\nderived only on the external path, or we are using raw keypool.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————\r\n\r\n#### Extra Note\r\nThis PR, in about 85% at least, is about expanding the current test coverage for the change output detection area.\r\n\r\n#### TO DO (still WIP):\r\n\r\n* [x] Save “internal” flag on non-active descriptors so the wallet can use them on the change detection process.\r\n   (which will fix the currently failing test cases).\r\n* [ ] Re-organize commits so tests always pass.\r\n* [ ] Verify backwards compatibility.",

          "title": "wallet: fix crash on loading descriptor wallet containing legacy key type entries",
          "body": "Loading a descriptor wallet currently leads to a segfault if a legacy key type entry is present that can be deserialized successfully and needs SPKman-interaction. To reproduce with a \"cscript\" entry (see second commit for details):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli createwallet crashme\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli unloadwallet crashme\r\n$ sqlite3 ~/.bitcoin/wallets/crashme/wallet.dat\r\nSQLite version 3.38.2 2022-03-26 13:51:10\r\nEnter \".help\" for usage hints.\r\nsqlite> INSERT INTO main VALUES(x'07637363726970740000000000000000000000000000000000000000', x'00');\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli loadwallet crashme\r\n\r\n--- bitcoind output: ---\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z Using SQLite Version 3.38.2\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z Using wallet /home/honey/.bitcoin/wallets/crashme\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z init message: Loading wallet…\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z [crashme] Wallet file version = 10500, last client version = 249900\r\n\r\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBackground: In the wallet key-value-loading routine, most legacy type entries require a `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` instance after successful deserialization. On a descriptor wallet, creating that (via method `GetOrCreateLegacyScriptPubKeyMan`) fails and then leads to a null-pointer dereference crash. E.g. for CSCRIPT: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/50422b770a40f5fa964201d1e99fd6b5dc1653ca/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L589-L594\r\n\r\n\r\n~~This PR fixes this by simply ignoring legacy entries if the wallet flags indicate that we have a descriptor wallet. The second commits adds a regression test to the descriptor wallet's functional test (fortunately Python includes sqlite3 support in the standard library).~~\r\n\r\n~~Probably it would be even better to throw a warning to the user if unexpected legacy entries are found in descriptor wallets, but I think as a first mitigation everything is obvisouly better than crashing. As far as I'm aware, descriptor wallets created/migrated by Bitcoin Core should never end up in a state containing legacy type entries though.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by throwing an error if legacy entries are found in descriptor wallets on loading.",

This is used for both the wallettool's `dump` command, and `migratewallet`.\r\n\r\nBased on #26606 ",

          "body": "This PR introduces support for v2 P2P encryption(BIP 324) in the existing functional test framework and adds functional tests for the same.\r\n\r\n### commits overview\r\n1. introduces a new class `EncryptedP2PState` to store the keys, functions for performing the initial v2 handshake and encryption/decryption.\r\n3. this class is used by `P2PConnection` in inbound/outbound connections to perform the initial v2 handshake before the v1 version handshake. Only after the initial v2 handshake is performed do application layer P2P messages(version, verack etc..) get exchanged. (in a v2 connection)\r\n    - `v2_state` is the object of class `EncryptedP2PState` in `P2PConnection` used to store its keys, session-id etc.\r\n    - a node [advertising](https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md#advertising-to-support-v2-p2p) support for  v2 P2P is different from a node actually [supporting v2 P2P](https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md#supporting-v2-p2p) (differ when false advertisement of services occur)\r\n        - introduce a boolean variable `supports_v2_p2p` in `P2PConnection` to denote if it supports v2 P2P.\r\n        - introduce a boolean variable `advertises_v2_p2p` to denote whether `P2PConnection` which mimics peer behaviour advertises V2 P2P support. Default option is `False`.\r\n    - In the test framework, you can create Inbound and Outbound connections to `TestNode`\r\n        1. During **Inbound Connections**, `P2PConnection` is the initiator [`TestNode` <--------- `P2PConnection`]\r\n            - Case 1:\r\n                - if the `TestNode` advertises/signals v2 P2P support (means `self.nodes[i]` set up with `\"-v2transport=1\"`), different behaviour will be exhibited based on whether:\r\n                    1. `P2PConnection` supports v2 P2P\r\n                    2. `P2PConnection` does not support v2 P2P\r\n               - In a real world scenario, the initiator node would intrinsically know if they support v2 P2P based on whatever code they choose to run. However, in the test scenario where we mimic peer behaviour, we have no way of knowing if `P2PConnection` should support v2 P2P or not. So `supports_v2_p2p` boolean variable is used as an option to enable support for v2 P2P in `P2PConnection`.\r\n              - Since the `TestNode` advertises v2 P2P support (using \"-v2transport=1\"), our initiator `P2PConnection` would send:\r\n                1. (if the `P2PConnection` supports v2 P2P) ellswift + garbage bytes to initiate the connection\r\n                2. (if the `P2PConnection` does not support v2 P2P) version message to initiate the connection\r\n           - Case 2:\r\n                - if the `TestNode` doesn't signal v2 P2P support; `P2PConnection` being the initiator would send version message to initiate a connection.\r\n       2. During **Outbound Connections** [TestNode --------> P2PConnection]\r\n           - initiator `TestNode` would send:\r\n                - (if the `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P) ellswift + garbage bytes to initiate the connection\r\n                - (if the `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P) version message to initiate the connection\r\n          - Suppose `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P support when it actually doesn't support v2 P2P (false advertisement scenario)\r\n               - `TestNode` sends ellswift + garbage bytes\r\n               - `P2PConnection` receives but can't process it and disconnects.\r\n               - `TestNode` then tries using v1 P2P and sends version message\r\n               - `P2PConnection` receives/processes this successfully and they communicate on v1 P2P\r\n\r\n4. the encrypted P2P messages follow a different format - 3 byte length + 1-13 byte message_type + payload + 16 byte MAC\r\n5. includes support for testing decoy messages and v2 connection downgrade(using false advertisement - when a v2 node makes an outbound connection to a node which doesn't support v2 but is advertised as v2 by some malicious\r\nintermediary)\r\n\r\n### run the tests\r\n* functional test - `test/functional/p2p_v2_encrypted.py` `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py`\r\n\r\nI'm also super grateful to @ dhruv for his really valuable feedback on this branch.\r\nAlso written a more elaborate explanation here - https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md",

      "body": "I have a question related to `sethdseed`. I can see why we would want to be able to _set_ a seed for an empty wallet, this is use case is clear to me. However I don't fully understand yet the use case for being able to _change_ the seed for existing wallet. Is this intended? If yes, can we better describe the use case for this?\r\n\r\nMy best guess is that changing seed is needed for key rotation, but I think creating new wallet might actually be a better way to rotate keys. Separate wallets provide much better control over your identities by isolating them and avoiding accidentally mixing them up.",

          "body": "The wallet currently does not know the master key that was used to generate the automatically generated descriptors. This makes it difficult to add new automatically generated descriptors when new ones are introduced. So instead of losing this information after the descriptors are created, have `CWallet` store it. The xpub will be stored in a new `activehdkey` field. The private key must be one of the keys that is used by the descriptors, and will be extracted upon loading.\r\n\r\nAs this is a new field, wallets will be automatically upgraded upon loading. This loading is backwards compatible and uses a new non-required flag `WALLET_FLAG_GLOBAL_HD_KEY` to signal that the upgrade completed. The upgrade will search for an xpub that is shared by `pkh()`, `wpkh()`, and `sh(wpkh()` descriptors with the derivation pattern that we use. For new wallets, the xpub will be set during descriptor creation rather than trying to reverse engineer it. The flag will be set for all wallets, regardless of whether such an xpub was found or can even exist, in order to indicate that the upgrade will not need to be run in the future.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to have a `gethdkey` command which is useful for those who need a simple way to get an xpub from a wallet. `gethdkey` can also take a boolean parameter to indicate whether it should also output the corresponding xprv.\r\n\r\nSupercedes #23417",

That means every block requires re-hashing and re-sorting for every script pub key before matching against the filter.\r\n\r\nTo improve on the performance we can simply generate filters using per index random keys (rather than per filter keys).  We don't share these filters with any attacker so there is no security risk.\r\n\r\nI don't use synthetic benchmarks for this as we have only a single data set we're ever processing.\r\n\r\nOn an arbitrary server:\r\nNo filters: 132 minutes\r\nBlock filters: 45 minutes\r\nWallet filters: 7 minutes\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "When producing a dummy signature for the purpose of estimating the transaction fee, do not assume an external signer performs R-value grinding on the signature.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this avoids a scenario where the fee rate is 1 sat / vbyte and a transaction with a 72 byte signature is not accepted into our mempool.\r\n\r\nSuggested testing:\r\n1. On master, launch with `-signet` and create an external signer wallet using e.g. a Trezor and HWI, see [guide](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/external-signer.md#example-usage) (with the GUI it should \"just work\" once you have the HWI path configured).\r\n2. Create a few addresses and fund them from the faucet: https://signet.bc-2.jp/ (wait for confirmation)\r\n3. Create another address, and now send the entire wallet to it, set the fee to 1 sat/byte\r\n4. Most likely this transaction never gets broadcast and you won't see it on the [signet explorer](https://explorer.bc-2.jp) \r\n\r\n5. With this PR, try again.\r\n6. Check the explorer and inspect the transaction. Each input witness starts with either `30440220` (R has 32 bytes) or `30440221` (R has 33 bytes). See this explainer for [DER encoding](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/92680/what-are-the-der-signature-and-sec-format).\r\n\r\nFixes #26030 ",

          "title": "wallet: Keep track of the wallet's own transaction outputs in memory",
          "body": "Currently, the wallet is not actually aware about its own transaction outputs. Instead, it will iterate all of the transactions stored in `mapWallet`, and then all of the outputs of those transactions, in order to figure out what belongs to it for the purposes of coin selection and balance calculation. For balance calculation, there is caching that results in it only iterating all of the transactions, but not all of the outputs. However when the cache is dirty, everything is iterated. This is especially problematic for wallets that have a lot of transactions, or transactions that have a lot of unrelated outputs (as may occur with coinjoins or batched payments).\r\n\r\nThis PR helps to resolve this issue by making the wallet track all of the outputs that belong to it in a new member `m_txos`. Note that this includes outputs that may have already been spent. Both balance calculation (`GetBalance`) and coin selection (`AvailableCoins`) are updated to iterate `m_txos`. This is generally faster since it ignores all of the unrelated outputs, and it is not slower as in the worst case of wallets containing only single output transactions, it's exactly the same number of outputs iterated.\r\n\r\n`m_txos` is memory only, and it is populated during wallet loading. When each transaction is loaded, all of its outputs are checked to see if it is `IsMine`, and if so, an entry added to `m_txos`. When new transactions are received, the same procedure is done.\r\n\r\nSince imports can change the `IsMine` status of a transaction (although they can only be \"promoted\" from watchonly to spendable), all of the import RPCs will be a bit slower as they re-iterate all transactions and all outputs to update `m_txos`.\r\n\r\nEach output in `m_txos` is stored in a new `WalletTXO` class. This class contains references to the parent `CWalletTx` and the `CTxOut` itself. It also caches the `IsMine` value of the txout. This should be safe as `IsMine` should not change unless there are imports. This allows us to have additional performance improvements in places that use these `WalletTXO`s as they can use the cached `IsMine` rather than repeatedly calling `IsMine` which can be expensive.\r\n\r\nThe existing `WalletBalance` benchmark demonstrates the performance improvement that this PR makes. The existing `WalletAvailableCoins` benchmark doesn't as all of the outputs used in that benchmark belong to the test wallet. I've updated that benchmark to have a bunch of unrelated outputs in each transaction so that the difference is demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a larger project to have the wallet actually track and store a set of its UTXOs.\r\n\r\nBuilt on #24914 as it requires loading the txs last in order for `m_txos` to be built correctly.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks:\r\n\r\nMaster:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       92,245,141.50 |               10.84 |    0.1% |  988,823,975.00 |  66,803,340.50 |    0.0% |      2.04 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            5,709.90 |          175,134.50 |    0.5% |       80,968.24 |      25,539.15 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|          139,396.17 |            7,173.80 |    0.6% |    1,383,390.50 |     430,276.86 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            5,055.80 |          197,792.47 |    0.3% |       80,968.10 |      25,539.02 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|                9.79 |      102,152,396.19 |    0.1% |          161.00 |          37.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,552,736.00 |              644.02 |    1.5% |   20,316,315.80 |     618,545.80 |    0.6% |      0.08 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|      114,114,732.00 |                8.76 |    0.5% |1,291,047,717.60 | 320,244,602.00 |    0.0% |      6.30 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      359,315,754.00 |                2.78 |    0.1% |4,339,447,818.00 | 136,619,757.00 |    0.7% |      1.80 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|       98,230,601.00 |               10.18 |    0.1% |  537,688,964.00 |  97,332,266.00 |    0.3% |      0.49 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n\r\nPR:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       75,319,868.50 |               13.28 |    0.2% |  863,758,229.00 |  30,892,593.00 |    0.2% |      1.66 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            2,367.62 |          422,364.95 |    1.0% |       35,785.05 |       9,893.01 |    0.2% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|            2,685.58 |          372,359.55 |    0.2% |       36,501.05 |      10,027.01 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            3,462.24 |          288,830.68 |    2.7% |       35,785.06 |       9,893.01 |    0.3% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|               11.65 |       85,838,176.97 |    0.1% |          180.00 |          42.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,563,092.60 |              639.76 |    1.5% |   20,426,154.40 |     649,953.80 |    0.6% |      0.09 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|       58,367,804.40 |               17.13 |    0.9% |  587,164,005.00 | 107,905,843.80 |    0.1% |      3.21 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      365,302,636.00 |                2.74 |    0.2% |4,349,345,147.00 | 138,730,668.00 |    0.8% |      1.83 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|      124,995,585.00 |                8.00 |    1.2% |  801,998,316.00 | 103,210,721.00 |    0.3% |      0.63 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n",

          "body": "During initial block download, the node's wallet(s) scans every arriving block looking for data that it owns.\r\nThis process can be resource-intensive, as it involves sequentially scanning all transactions within each\r\narriving block.\r\n\r\nTo avoid wasting processing power, we can skip blocks that occurred before the wallet's creation time, \r\nsince these blocks are guaranteed not to contain any relevant wallet data.\r\n\r\nThis has direct implications (an speed improvement) on the underlying blockchain synchronization process\r\nas well. The reason is that the validation interface queue is limited to 10 tasks per time. This means that no\r\nmore than 10 blocks can be waiting for the wallet(s) to be processed while we are synchronizing the chain\r\n(activating the best chain to be more precise).\r\nWhich can be a bottleneck if blocks arrive and are processed faster from the network than what they are \r\nprocessed by the wallet(s).\r\n\r\nSo, by skipping not relevant blocks in the wallet's IBD scanning process, we will also improve the chain \r\nsynchronization time.",

          "body": "This new feature is an implementation of the ideas in Paul Sztorc's blog post \"Deniability - Unilateral Transaction Meta-Privacy\"(https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/deniability/).\r\n\r\nIn short, the idea is to periodically split coins and send them to yourself, making it look like common \"spend\" transactions, such that blockchain ownership analysis becomes more difficult, and thus improving the user's privacy.\r\n\r\nThis is the GUI portion of the PR (bitcoin-core/gui). The core functionality PR ( https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27792 ) is in the main repo (bitcoin/bitcoin).\r\n\r\nThis PR implements an additional \"Deniability\" wallet view. The majority of the GUI code is in a new deniabilitydialog.cpp/h source files containing a new DeniabilityDialog class, hooked up via the WalletView class. \r\n\r\nOn startup and on notable events (new blocks, new transactions, etc), we evaluate the privacy of all coins in the wallet, and we build a \"deniabilization\" candidate list. UTXOs that share the same destination address are grouped together into a single candidate (see DeniabilityDialog::updateCoins and DeniabilityDialog::updateCoinTable).\r\n\r\nWe inspect the blockchain data to find out if we have performed \"deniabilization\" transactions already, and we count how many \"cycles\" (self-sends) have been performed for each coin (see DeniabilityDialog::calculateDeniabilizationStats). Since we infer the state entirely from the blockchain data, even if the wallet is restored from a backup, the state would not be lost. This also means that if the user has performed manual self-sends that have improved the ownership privacy, they will be counted too.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_initial\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/6626cca3-1b96-4ccd-9463-2a91a9993faa\">\r\n\r\nThe user has a couple of controls for the \"deniabillization\" process - a Frequency selector and a Budget spinner, which respectively determine how often to perform a cycle (see below) and how much total BTC to spend on transaction fees.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_pick_budget_frequency\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/7508c23f-2ebb-4345-a440-49b9f60b8412\">\r\n\r\nThe user can initiate the \"deniabillization\" process by pressing the Start button (DeniabilityDialog::startDeniabilization). \r\nThe first time the button is pressed, we offer an information / confirmation box to explain to the user how Deniability works.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"532\" alt=\"deniability_view_start_confirmation\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/c08ee856-8736-4e4e-be71-28219735f764\">\r\n\r\nThe process periodically perform a \"deniabilization\" cycle (DeniabilityDialog::deniabilizeProc). In each such cycle we do the following: \r\nA coin is selected form the candidate list. The more a coin is \"deniabilized\", the less likely it is to be selected. Smaller coins are also less likely to be selected. If a coin is selected, we prepare and broadcast a transaction, which splits the coin into a pair of new wallet addresses (DeniabilityDialog::deniabilizeCoin). \r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_tx_awaiting_confirmation\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/df0354dc-f60f-45db-b692-db5c6ca36253\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"transaction_view_after_deniabilization\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/709084d3-227d-4c0d-ac47-cd83433b992a\">\r\n\r\nIf Bitcoin Core is left running continuously, the cycles would be performed at the selected frequency (with some randomization). If Bitcoin Core is shutdown, the \"deniabilization\" process will resume at the next restart, and if more time has elapsed than the selected frequency, it will perform a single cycle. We deliberately don't \"catch up\" all missed cycles, since that would expose the process to blockchain analysis. The state is saved and restored via QSettings (DeniabilityDialog::loadSettings and DeniabilityDialog::saveSettings).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_next_cycle_countdown\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/da5a71e1-0174-4f2a-a9b3-b8a635abe769\">\r\n\r\nWe monitor each broadcasted transaction and we automatically attempt a fee bump if the transaction is still in the memory pool since the previous cycle (DeniabilityDialog::bumpDeniabilizationTx). We don't issue any other deniabilization transactions until the previous transaction is confirmed (or abandoned/dropped).\r\n\r\nThe process ends when the budget is exhausted or if there's no candidates left. The user can also stop the process manually by pressing a Stop button (DeniabilityDialog::stopDeniabilization).\r\n\r\nExternal signers are supported in a \"best effort\" way - since the user needs to manually sign, we postpone the deniabilization processing till the external signer is connected and use some additional UI to get the user's attention to sign (see the codepath predicated on hasExternalSigner). This is not ideal, so I'm looking for ideas if we can improve this in some way.\r\n\r\nWatch-only wallets are partially supported, where we display the candidate list, but we don't allow any processing (since we don't have the private keys to issue transactions).\r\n\r\nI've tested all this functionality on regtest, testnet, signet and mainnet. I've also added some unit tests (under WalletTests) to exercise the main functions.\r\n\r\nThis is my first change and PR for Bitcoin Core, and I did my best to validate everything against the guidelines and documentation and to follow the patterns in the existing code, but I'm sure there may be things I've missed, so I'm looking forward to your feedback. \r\nIn particular one thing I'm not particularly happy with - the save/restore of state via QSettings makes me a bit nervous as we store wallet specific data keyed on wallet name, however wallets can be erased and new ones created with the same name, so this is not ideal. I made an effort to validate all data on load, but it would be great if we could improve this somehow - either by storing the settings based on some wallet identity signature, or by storing the state in the wallet database (however that doesn't seem accessible via the interfaces::Wallet API). Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

The majority of the code is in a new deniabilitydialog.cpp/h source files containing a new DeniabilityDialog class, hooked up to the WalletView class._ \"\r\n\r\nWhile the Deniability dialog can be implemented entirely with the existing API, adding the core \"deniabilization\" functions to the interfaces::Wallet API allows us to implement the GUI portion with much less code, and more importantly allows us to add RPC support and more thorough unit tests, which is what this PR attempts to do.\r\n\r\nThe main \"deniabilization\" functionality is implemented in spend.cpp/h and feebumper.cpp/h and exposed via the interfaces::Wallet API. \r\nWe've added RPC support via a new RPC call \"walletdeniabilizecoin\". \r\nWe also extended the Wallet tests with coverage for the functionality.\r\n",

          "body": "## For reviewers\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to make reviewing a bit more sane, I'm breaking this up into a few smaller PRs, but will keep this one open as the parent PR and keep it rebased on the child PRs. The main purpose of having this PR is to track progress on child PRs and also have an easy way to compile `bitcoind` with both send and receive support for testing. Additionally, I'll be adding more functional tests to this PR since it's much easier to test when `bitcoind` can both send and receive.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122\r\n  - Implements the logic from BIP352 without any wallet code. This PR adds the necessary cryptographic functions and implements the logic needed for sending and scanning. This PR also includes the test vectors from the BIP as unit tests. Both the send and receive PRs have this as a dependency. In terms of priority, this PR should be reviewed first\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201\r\n  - Implements sending in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to send to a silent payment address, regardless of whether or not the wallet can receive silent payments\r\n  - Ready for review, but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28202\r\n  - Implements receiving in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to generate silent payment addresses and scan for silent payments, regardless of whether or not the wallet can send to a silent payment address\r\n  - Ready for review but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n\r\nFor the silent payments specification, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458\r\n\r\n## Overall\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the full silent payments scheme: sending and receiving. The following items are not covered in this PR and are intended for follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n* Adding labels for the receiver wallet\r\n* Full RPC coverage (only `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` are covered in this PR)\r\n* Light client support (vending the tweak data per block, either in an index or to serve to indexer, such as electrum server)\r\n* Add benchmarks to validate that there are no DoS concerns for doing silent payment verification for transactions in the mempool\r\n* External signer support (dependent on hardware wallets supporting silent payments)\r\n* More unit / functional test coverage\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24897. Below is a summary of the major changes:\r\n\r\n* Remove labels\r\n  * The original draft included labels, but this has been deferred for a later PR. Labels are not necessary for sending and receiving and there are still some open questions on how best to implement them in Bitcoin Core. Labels can also be added at any point by the receiver without requiring any changes from the sender\r\n* Remove indexes\r\n  * In the original draft, indexes were used when scanning for silent payments and when doing wallet rescans. This has been removed in favor of using `rev*.dat` files for rescanning. It may make sense to add an index in the future, but for the purpose of vending tweak data to light clients, which is still an open question\r\n* Update to implement the most current version of BIP352\r\n  * Since the original draft, there have been a few changes in the BIP which are reflected in the current PR. Most notably, using 33-byte compressed keys for the silent payment address (as opposed to X-only keys in the original draft) \r\n\r\nIt may be helpful for context to read through the discussions on #24897 , but ongoing review should happen in the relevant child PRs listed above.",

This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

          "body": "It was somewhat surprising to me that wallet_backwards_compatibility.py did not catch #27915 since the purpose of the test is to find downgrade issues such as that. It turns out the test was deficient in several places when it came to testing descriptor wallets, as well as deficient in addition to failing to correctly test some releases.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these test cases, adds more informative logging, slightly refactors the entire test in order to better test future versions, and adds a 25.0 node to the test.\r\n\r\nNotable changes:\r\n* The compatibility test with 0.16 should not have been passing. The wallets were being copied incorrectly for 0.16 and resulting in 0.16 creating new wallets rather than testing the target wallets.\r\n* The downgrade test will actually be run on descriptor wallets and it will test that downgrades are successful, and a subsequent upgrade is also successful. This catches #27915.\r\n* The upgrade and downgrade test will be run on all versions up to master, rather than just 0.16, 0.17, and 0.19.",

          "body": "A couple of users have requested that we support wallets that encrypt everything, even if the wallet is watch-only, in order to have better privacy if the wallet is stolen. This PR introduces an `EncryptedDatabase` backend for the wallet which encrypts/decrypts each key-value record individually before reading from or writing to the database.\r\n\r\n`EncryptedDatabase` is only supported for SQLite databases and descriptor wallets. This was done in order to have an easier way to get downgrade protection that also does not involve writing an existing record in plaintext (e.g. `minversion` or `flags`). SQLite has a fixed field \"application id\" that we already use for cross-network protection. This is reused to detect if a sqlite database is an encrypted wallet, and thus it prevents older software from attempting to open such wallets.\r\n\r\nIn order to read records from the database, `EncryptedDatabase` will cache the decrypted key in memory so that it can lookup the encrypted key in the database. Values will always be decrypted when read.\r\n\r\nThe encryption scheme is the same one that we use for encrypting private keys. It's not that great, but I didn't feel like re-implementing it, and it seems good enough. The encryption key itself is encrypted with the passphrase and stored in a new record.\r\n\r\nWallets with encrypted databases cannot be loaded on start. They can only be loaded by explicit user action through `loadwallet` which now has a `db_passphrase` parameter to allow the decryption of these wallets. `createwallet` also has a `db_passphrase` to create these wallets. For now, there is no way to encrypt the database after it has been created, nor is there a way to change the passphrase.",

If interested in those commits, please review on #28122\r\n\r\n## Sending \r\n### Silent Payments logic\r\n\r\nThe main focus of this PR is:\r\n\r\n* Applying the Taptweak to a taproot internal private key (this is a copy-paste of the code for applying the taptweak in the signing process)\r\n* Getting a private key from a given `scriptPubKey`\r\n* Creating silent payment outputs\r\n* Applying the created scriptPubKeys back to the vector of `CRecipients`\r\n\r\nThe functions are then used together to create silent payment outputs during `CreateTransactionInternal`.\r\n\r\n### Final steps\r\n\r\nThe last commits ensure that:\r\n\r\n* Coin selection is silent payments aware and knows to exclude taproot script path spends and inputs with unknown witness when funding a transaction which pays to a silent payment address\r\n* The change output type is correctly chosen when paying to a silent payment address\r\n* Functional tests\r\n",

          "body": "This PR implements receiving silent payment transactions through the use of a new `ScriptPubKeyMan` type: `SilentPaymentsSPKM`. This is a descriptor wallet only feature, although it does not use descriptors.\r\n\r\nThis is an optional feature, so the only way to use it is to create a new wallet with `createwallet` with `silent_payments=true`. Such wallets will have a single `SilentPaymentsSPKM` that is used for both receiving and change. Since silent payments only have a single address, repeated calls to `getnewaddress` and `getrawchangeaddress` always return the same address, however the receiving and change addresses are different, see the BIP for how the change is generated.\r\n\r\nSince silent payments requires the spent coins in order to extract public keys from them, `TransactionAddedToMempool` is modified to also provide that information. For scanning blocks, the wallet will retrieve that information from the undo data. Additionally, when rescanning, a silent payments wallet must use the slow rescan method.\r\n\r\nThe labels feature has not been fully implemented yet and is left for a followup.\r\n\r\nBased on #28122 and #28201 \r\n\r\nAlternative to #28202",

          "title": "wallet: optimize migration process, batch db transactions",
          "body": "The benchmark conducted locally showed a ~65% processing time reduction, on a SSD.\r\nResults can be found at the end of the description.\r\n\r\n#### Detailed Description:\r\nThe current wallet migration process performs only individual db writes. Accessing disk to\r\ndelete all legacy records, clone and clean each address book entry for every created wallet,\r\ncreate each new descriptor (with their corresponding master key, caches and key pool), and\r\nalso clone and delete each transaction that requires to be transferred to a different wallet.\r\n\r\nThis work consolidates all individual disk writes into two batch operations. One for the descriptors\r\ncreation from the legacy data and a second one for the execution of the migration process itself.\r\nEfficiently dumping all the information to disk at once atomically at the end of each process.\r\n\r\nThis represent a speed up and also a consistency improvement. During migration, we either\r\nwant to succeed or fail. No other outcomes should be accepted. We should never leave a\r\npartially migrated wallet on disk and request the user to manually restore the previous wallet from\r\na backup (at least not if we can avoid it).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since db transactions relevant to the key pool generation were also batched, this work\r\nalso speeds up the regular wallet creation process.\r\n\r\n#### Note for Testers:\r\nThe first commit introduces a benchmark for the migration process. This one can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master to compare results pre and post changes.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the benchmark setup may take some time (~70 seconds here) due to the absence\r\nof a batching mechanism for the address generation process (`GetNewDestination()` calls). Which,\r\nI plan to address in a separate PR, just to not continue expanding this PR.\r\n\r\n#### Final Notes:\r\nThis PR is intended to be an \"all-in-one\" solution that's ready for use and testing. In the coming days, \r\nwill start breaking it down into smaller, focused PRs for better manageability and review.\r\n\r\n————————————————————————\r\n\r\nBenchmark on master (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:-----------\r\n|   65,093,884,958.00 |                0.02 |    0.0% |     65.09 | `WalletMigration`\r\n\r\nBenchmark on this branch (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|   22,926,814,750.00 |                0.04 |    0.0% |     22.93 | `WalletMigration`",

          "title": "RPC: add new `listmempooltransactions`",
          "body": "## Proposed Update\r\n\r\nAdd a new RPC endpoint, `listmempooltransactions`. Takes as args a `start_sequence` and `verbose`.\r\n\r\nReturns: \r\n- if verbose false, list of txids + their `entry_sequence` where each entry's `entry_sequence` >= the provided `start_sequence.\r\n- if verbose true, raw tx output info including each entry's `entry_sequence`.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilds on work done in #19572.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\nThe current mempool RPCs are lacking an ability to scan for updates in a more efficient manner. You can subscribe for updates via the ZMQ pipeline, but even this is inefficient to recover from if your consumer app falls offline.\r\n\r\nZMQ also is a push protocol, and doesn't provide a rate-limiting mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn the case of core-lightning, we don't assume access to bitcoin-core/ZMQ, so we're unable to do efficient mempool querying. There have been some recent CVEs come to light where having optional access to mempool updates may prove useful.\r\n\r\nPaging, filtering by last seen, and the addition of full tx data in the call makes mempool data more readily available to any client app. This is good for self-sovereignty as it reduces the need for additional dependencies and app data sources to efficiently query and parse mempool data. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Things I Considered\r\nMy initial attempt at this modified `getrawmempool` to \r\n- take a `start_sequence` to allow for filtering, and\r\n- adding the txdata (inputs outpoints + outputs (amount + scriptPubKeys)). \r\n\r\nThat was pretty ugly however, given that the current data model for `getrawmempool` is around a concept of \"mempool entry\" data. This returns transaction data (and does not report on information about other mempool dependencies etc; for that you should still call `getrawmempool` or `getmempoolentry`). \r\n\r\nYou could add a `start_sequence` to the existing `getrawmempool` to help with entry data paging/querying but that's secondary to my goals for fetching relevant txdata from the mempool.\r\n\r\n## Additions/Changes\r\n\r\nThis PR could be further improved by\r\n- Add a `page_size` argument which allows a calling application to limit the number of results returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\nThe current RPC only supports finding *added* mempool transactions. It'd be interesting to experiment with keeping track of evicted/not mined transactions and adding them to the results.\r\n\r\nThis would require:\r\n- An additional memory buffer (perhaps a configurable memory limited ring buffer?) for evicted tx data and the mempool sequence of the eviction.\r\n- Adding a `sequence_action` field for results, which indicates whether the sequence is for the tx's `addition` or `eviction`.\r\n\r\nYou could also keep track of tx movements into blocks, but this seems less useful/urgent in general.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nYou can see an example of this implemented and used in CLN for finding paid onchain invoices in this branch: https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/compare/master...niftynei:lightning:nifty/mempool-scan\r\n\r\nNote that the CLN implementation doesn't currently keep the mempool_sequence in disk, so it'll reload/rescan the mempool at start. This *may* be desirable?\r\n\r\nHere's how a caller would use this\r\n\r\n```\r\n1) start node\r\n2) listmempooltransactions 0 to get backlog\r\n3) call listmempooltransactions again with `start_sequence` set to `mempool_sequence` result from last call\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this works well with ZMQ as the `mempool_sequence` number is identical.",
