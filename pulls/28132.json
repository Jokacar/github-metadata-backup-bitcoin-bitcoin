Though probably only with a portion of their total hash power as I've only seen a few potential full-rbf replacements mined by them.\r\n\r\nThat's 37% (+ MARA Pool) of total hash power regularly mining full-rbf transactions.\r\n\r\nObviously, with this much support of full-rbf, arguments against it on the basis that unconfirmed transactions are safe are even more clearly invalid. Secondly, on the basis of mempool consistency with miners, since full-rbf is the compatible policy in almost all cases, we should be supporting it by default if you take the position that we want to optimize for consistency with miners. (CC: @achow101) Thirdly, all previous arguments in favor of full-rbf, such as multiparty transactions, wallets, user-expectations, etc. still apply.\r\n\r\nThis simplification of mempool policy is well overdue. Let's get this merged and this silly debate over with. Miners and node operators who choose to disable full-rbf still can with a simple configuration change.\r\n\r\n",

Previously the default was false/disabled. Users who update Bitcoin Core to a version containing this change would by default propagate and mine full-rbf replacements unless they had chosen to disable full-rbf.\r\n\r\nA significant fraction of the P2P network has already chosen to enable full-rbf, so full-rbf replacements propagate reasonably well. Almost half of pools by hash power has enabled full-rbf, so full-rbf replacements that reach those miners are readily mined, as seen on https://mempool.space/rbf#fullrbf and https://fullrbf.mempool.observer/",

      "body": "On the first line of arguments, I think zero-conf business acceptance have the option to deploy additional full-nodes with good transaction-relay peering to obtain a reasonable view of network mempools, and therefore increase their odds of seeing a double-spend of a confirmation of interest. In practice, zero-conf applications have risk threshold, once those thresholds are reached they will deactivate zero-conf acceptance.\r\n\r\nOn the second line or arguments, mempool consistency with miners is becoming a practical concern in my opinion with the appereance of so-called “transaction accelerators”, as now LSPs can use those out-of-band transaction-relay service to fee-bump their stuck multi-party transactions, and therefore provoke a divergence with the rest of the network. I raised this risk of [“mining income asymmetries due to unequal access in to transaction flows bypassing policies”](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26438#issuecomment-1299522242) in Suhas proposal to remove the mempoolfullrbf option months ago.\r\n\r\nOn the third line of arguments about the enhancement of multi-party funded transactions flows, the original motivation is explained in this [post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-May/003033.html) on the lightning dev mailing list. RBF opt-out allows a counterparty contributing an input to block the confirmation of a multi-party transaction at minimal cost, therefore enabling a liquidity griefing at low-cost (size of the pinning tx * mempool min fee).\r\n\r\nSince then, early Lightning Service Providers deploying dual-funding have raised again the [concern](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-May/003920.html) on the mailing list during May of this year, and how sustained RBF signaling flag opt-out can be an annoying vector of pinning attack. While from my understanding the issue might be solved on the Lightning-side by upcoming deployment of nversion=3 (where full-rbf is implied by the policy regime), this won’t solve the pinning issue for coinjoin multi-party transactions which are concerned too (and this is not sure that we’re deploying nversion=3 for the dual-funding/splicing flows due to package limits size). With that context in mind, full-rbf by default is a welcome deployment for second-layers and multi-party applications.\r\n\r\nOn the deployment schedule, we’re still mid-26.0 schedule, so I think it’s reasonable to land it now (feature freeze scheduled for 2023-10-01 as of today July 24th). This still gives a period of roughly 5 months to zero-conf business and other software that would need to tweak their software.\r\n\r\n37% of the hash power sounds a reasonable demonstration of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem selecting the transaction-relay policy favoring maximization of their mining income strategy.\r\n\r\nSo I’m Concept ACK on this change, I still think this change deserves announcement on the mailing list and usual technical communication channels to warn ecosystem stakeholders impacted by the proposed change.",

The arguments for this include miner incentive compatibility, maximization of fees per block through next-block priority-competition, utility for merchants and consumers, intelligent double-spend risk mitigation, protection of the user space, and optimization of Bitcoin adoption, utility, and activity.\r\n\r\nI apologize for not yet having a reference link with full details of all of my arguments, but I am happy to interact with commenters on any arguments for a full RBF agenda here. I can also alleviate any concerns with current zero-conf acceptance risk mitigation.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate being heard, and having a fair chance to be reviewed and considered.\r\n\r\nI also need time for consideration because I am assisting some merchants and users with understanding how to interface with Bitcoin Core and what is happening, so they can express their support for this PR, and their value of zero-conf being useful as a service. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I am advocating for the Bitcoin network state that has thrived for its entire history so far, and asking that Bitcoin Core avoid steering policy.",

All those transactions were created by my OpenTimestamps calendars, and I can assure you they are full-rbf replacements.\n\nLots more too: https://alice.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/ https://bob.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/\n",

For full-rbf 1) miners can run their own nodes, 2) sufficient full-rbf nodes are running that miners can fairly reliably receive full-rbf replacements.\r\n\r\nThe status quo is _already_ that full-rbf replacements are regularly mined and can be propagated with a little bit of work.

My OTS calendars bump fees repeatedly, increasing the feerate by 1sat/vb with each replacement, starting at approximately the minimum relay fee. Every single one of those replacements is actually a long string of multiple replacements. mempool.space does not maintain replacement data beyond 24 hours or so; if you want to see live replacement data you can do to https://alice.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/ or https://bob.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/ and just click on any of the recently mined transactions to see mempool.space's replacement history data on them. You can also see full-rbf replacements at https://mempool.space/rbf#fullrbf, which I linked above as well.\r\n\r\nPlease delete your comment as it is factually incorrect and misleading. Frankly I'm surprised that you are so unaware of current mempool policies in use by miners that you were unaware of the fact that full-rbf has been widely adopted.",

I don't think that's just a fad at this point. However I'm inclined to wait a little bit longer, e.g. after the v26 release, to see if your observations are maintained and reproduced outside of OTS. The new mempool.space tracking is helpful here.\r\n\r\nIn the release notes we should remind wallet users to not (yet) stop using the RBF flag, because their peers may not reliably relay it.\r\n\r\n[0] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-July/021823.html",

This negative impact could be avoided by simply adding first seen safe rule - ie a trx can be replaced but needs to include the original outputs.\r\n\r\nAt GAP600 we continue to see strong use of our service for BTC we have seen circa 350k unique trx hash per month (over the last 3 months) requested to our platform. Our clients include - Coinpayments, Coinspaid and Changelly. Given the period of Mempool being full we have seen an increase a fee required in order to be approved by our platform for trx. This is not an insignificant use case and one which can be easily maintained as is.\r\n\r\nWe have provided further statistics in the past and direct feedback from Coinspaid CEO with in the mailing list see here - https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-December/021240.html\r\n\r\nWe have not seen any impact of full RBF on double spend rates for our trxs which seems to put in large question the stated figure of 40% adoption by miners at such a rate of adoption we would expect to see a large increase in double spends. We expect once this setting become default this will greatly change the adoption of this service.\r\n\r\nGAP600 model targets not to get it wrong and as such  we are very sensitive to any double spend which we get wrong in predicting as we reimburse our clients. GAP600 is not a payment processor rather services payment processors, merchants and non custodial liquidity providers which service non-custodial wallets. ",

This negative impact could be avoided by simply adding first seen safe rule - ie a trx can be replaced but needs to include the original outputs. At GAP600 we continue to see strong use of our service for BTC we have seen circa 350k unique trx hash per month (over the last 3 months) requested to our platform. Our clients include - Coinpayments, Coinspaid and Changelly.\r\n> I checked, and Coinpayments and Coinspaid are both merchant processors. I could not find any example of actual merchants using their platform accepting unconfirmed payments. I also could not find any documentation on their websites indicating unconfirmed transaction acceptance. As for Changelly, their website says right on the front that \"With an average transaction speed of 5–40 minutes, we ensure you can swiftly take advantage of market opportunities.\" Obivously, 5 minutes is not an unconfirmed payment. Additionally, I verified myself by doing test transactions with BIP125 disabled and an adequate fee: unconfirmed payments are not accepted by Changelly. As their exchange flow clearly says \"Once BTC is confirmed in the blockchain, we’ll start exchanging it to <coin>.\" You need to provide an genuine example of an actual merchant who accepts unconfirmed transactions as payment, and actually relies on first-seen behavior.\r\n> We have not seen any impact of full RBF on double spend rates for our trxs\r\n> Based on the above findings, this appears to be because you don't actually have any clients who rely on unconfirmed payments.\r\n\r\n",

Also please send me the 1 trx hash you tested and I can see if it was queried to our system and if so offer some info as to why it wasnt approved. Also if you can elaborate how you integrated with Changelly - I can check with them if that area is not integrated with GAP600. \n> As the architect of such a major change to the status of 0-conf transactions I would think you would welcome the opportunity to speak to business and users who actual activities will be impacted by full RBF becoming dominant.\n> Are you able to provide the same i.e emails and contacts of people at the mining pools who can confirm they have adopted FULL RBF ?\n\nFYI I replied to this on the mailing list. It's rather silly to duplicate this\nentire conversation both here and the bitcoin-dev mailing list.\n",
