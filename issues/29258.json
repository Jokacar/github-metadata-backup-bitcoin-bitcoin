      "body": "> Would this be a hard fork because it would be loosening the conditions for validation?\r\n\r\nI don't think so, since I don't think the value of `nChainTx` is used in validation (or do you see a spot where it is?). It's used for logging (progress estimation), and whether it is 0 is used in `HaveNumChainTxs`. The latter could become problematic in case of an overflow, since if the `unsigned int` would overflow exactly to zero (which is a bit unlikely given that there are a few thousand txns in each block but ceratainly possible) the node would crash in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/478ac185be49feffd1231366c07e06068683f941/src/validation.cpp#L3017.",

      "body": "For reference, I removed `nChainTx` from consensus in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29349. The next steps would be to add a member to `CChain` to account for the sum of `nTx`, and update it when `SetTip` is called. Then, update the RPC, wallet and estimate functions to derive the `nChainTx` they need from the `nChainTx` at the tip, walking the relevant portion of the chain.\r\n\r\nThis is possible, but I am not sure if it is worth it, because:\r\n\r\n* It is more code overall.\r\n* The RPC, wallet, and logging code is slower when it has to walk the chain.\r\n\r\nThe benefit mainly seems to be to reduce the memory footprint? On 64-bit platforms, `sizeof(CBlockIndex)` is 144. Adding 4 bytes or removing 4 bytes is less than 10% of cost or savings. Ref: https://godbolt.org/z/rKEPYTh4j\r\n\r\nRemoving `nTx` is even harder, so less worth it. Especially, given that it could be reduced to 16 bits in the memory layout, if needed.\r\n\r\nThis leads to an alternative solution to not increase the memory footprint: Move the 32+32 bits used for nTx and nChainTx into a single 64-bit blob, where the 16 bit are for nTx and the remaining for nChainTx. But, again, the overall heap memory usage shouldn't change much, either way.",
