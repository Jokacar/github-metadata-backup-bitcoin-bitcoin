Standard steps to build on OSX\r\n2. `./bitcoind` does not work and spawns the following error:\r\n```\r\nAssertion failed: ((pindexFirstNeverProcessed != nullptr) == (pindex->nChainTx == 0)), function CheckBlockIndex, file validation.cpp, line 4203.\r\nAbort trap: 6\r\n```\r\nStrangely enough, `bitcoin-cli` works, so I think this might be isolated to `bitcoind` and similar.\r\n\r\nI Didn't observe this earlier, think it may have occurred recently (or I may have done something which causes this). Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

It also shouldn't impact most future bip 9 (or similar) deployments, as most of those presumably won't need to change the storage format.\r\n\r\nSo I think this might just warrant a cleaner error message rather than handling it properly. Perhaps RewindBlockIndex's test should change from:\r\n\r\n    if (IsWitnessEnabled(pprev) && !BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS && !chainActive) { ... }\r\n\r\nto something like:\r\n\r\n    if (IsWitnessEnabled(pprev)) {\r\n        if (!BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS && !chainActive) {\r\n            ...\r\n        } else if (BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS && pprev->nChainTx == 0) {\r\n            LogPrintf(\"segwit activation height has changed, cannot reuse blockchain\");\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n",
