    "title": "Discussion: Should the mempool.dat file be encrypted/XORed?",
    "body": "XORing the `mempool.dat` was discussed as early as 2016 in the same PR that implemented `loadMempool()` and `dumpMempool`. Back then @sipa wrote:\r\n\r\n> XORed dump is not implemented, this can be done later. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8448#issuecomment-257226360\r\n\r\n**Should the `mempool.dat` file be XORed with a random key similar to how the chainstate <s>`blk*.dat`</s> is? Is it possible to include something malicious in the `mempool.dat` that could actually cause problems?**\r\n\r\nA sample attack vector where XORing could help (tl;dr below): \r\nAttacker `A` broadcasts a transaction `T` with the minimum relay fee/mempool acceptance fee. This `T` contains _something malicious_ e.g. via an `OP_RETURN` output. Due to the low fee, `T` could stay in the mempool of a lot of nodes for a maximum of two weeks (assuming medium to high feerate levels in that period). If `A` times this correctly, (s)he could broadcast `T` as soon as new release is published. Node operators would stop (`dumpMempool()`), update to new version, and restart (`loadMempool()`) their node. `T` would be persisted on disk in the `mempool.dat` until `((T is mined || T is evicted) && node is restarted)` (at e.g. the next major release). Broadcasting such a `T` could be done cheaply for a few hundred satoshis and as often as one is willing to do.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to the question what could be the _malicious something_ in `T`. Since, unlike the chainstate <s>blk*.dat files</s>, the `mempool.dat` is not critically needed for Bitcoin Core to run, an anti-virus software blocking the file wouldn't be a major problem. However e.g. a government entity scanning a hard drive in e.g. airport security could be a problem.\r\n\r\n**tl;dr:** I think, if timed correctly, you could persist a transaction with _malicious content_ in quite a lot of `mempool.dat` files for only a few satoshis. The transaction would stay in the `mempool.dat` file untll the bitcoin node restarts, which quite possible could be a full release cycle. My question now is: **Is there something malicious that could actually oppose a threat, if persisted in the `mempool.dat` ?** \r\n\r\nThis is open for discussion. I don't have an answer. If XORing is needed, I might implement it and open a PR at a later stage. \r\n\r\nedit: I mean't the obfuscated chainstate (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6650) and not XORed `blk*.dat` files.

This is confusing for users, and might deter them from running a full node.\r\n\r\nThere have already been several attempts [#6613 #6650 #16721] to obfuscate database so to not get flagged, but this has so far not solved the problem entirely. \r\n\r\nAs I read in the above mentioned issues, this might [not really be of concern to this repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12320#issuecomment-370557246), so my issue might be misplaced, if that is the case please close it.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution**\r\nI am unsure about the best approach to solving this issue, thus I open this issue to discuss and coordinate.

This claim is extremely incorrect.\r\nThe two software are, respectively, \"Bitcoin Core\" and \"Wasabi Wallet\".\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core, despite being one of the most (if not the most) highly scrutinized and maintained open-source software in existence, it is categorized as \"Bitcoin Miner\".\r\nBitcoin Core is considered to be Bitcoin's reference implementation, serves as a Bitcoin node and provides a Bitcoin wallet which fully verifies payments.\r\nIt is not possible to mine with this software, since the mining code was removed in 2013.\r\n\r\nWasabi Wallet is a open-source and non-custodial, Bitcoin wallet that integrates Bitcoin Core within it to validate transactions without having to connect to third party servers on the network, and for this reason, it is also reported as \"Bitcoin Miner\", when its only task is to allow users to manage bitcoins in a secure and user friendly way.\r\nAgain, Wasabi Wallet cannot in any way mine bitcoins (or any other cryptocurrency), as its sole purpose is to manage bitcoins.\r\n\r\n(optional from here, edit according to your antivirus - The more information there is, the better)\r\nAdditional information:\r\nProduct - McAfee Security Center\r\nVersion - v16.0\r\nEngine - 3181.0\r\nType of alert - ELF:BitCoinMiner-ET [PUP]\r\n\r\nYou can find the two files attached.\r\nLooking forward to your kind reply, I wish you a good job.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nName and Surname\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI bring this up now because with [Wasabi Wallet v1.1.10](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/releases/tag/v1.1.10), the [included bitcoind and hwi binaries](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/tree/master/WalletWasabi/Microservices/Binaries) are part of the reason why [Wasabi is now also flagged](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/pull/2858) as a potentially unwanted program.",
