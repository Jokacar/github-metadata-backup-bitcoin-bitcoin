    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nI would like to have the possibility to broadcast a transaction via the REST interface which is currently not possible https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nAn indexer like the ones for the electrum protocol should work without having access to the RPC interface, I think the only missing method from the REST interface is the tx broadcast.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like another REST end point like the following:\r\n\r\n`POST /tx`\r\n\r\nBroadcast a raw transaction to the network.\r\n\r\nThe transaction should be provided as hex in the request body. The txid will be returned on success. \r\n\r\n(hex is used for similarity with esplora [API](https://github.com/blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md#post-tx), binary would be ok)\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\nUsing RPC requires an authenticated connection.\r\nUsing the p2p network requires to know an additional endpoint and the peering from the indexer\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nThe REST interface already has risks https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md#risks and I don't think would be more risky to have tx broadcast\r\n\r\nTransaction packages may be added in another endpoint",
