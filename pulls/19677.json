    "body": "Currently we use an `unordered_map<uint256, CBlockIndex*>` for our BlockMap. This is a bit of a peculiar choice because we then store a pointer to the uint256 from the pair inside of the CBlockIndex. It would be conceptually simpler if we used a `unordered_map<CBlockIndex>` and modified `CBlockIndex` to directly own the uint256 for the phashBlock.\r\n\r\nThat's what this patch attempts doing. The only additional complexity is where we do want to query the map by key, the key equivalence stuff is only in C++20, so we add a helper that lets us construct a mock element easily for using with find.\r\n\r\nThe result is nicer since we get rid of an additional indirection for accessing the phashblock and we get rid of a lot of std::pair de-structuring. We also save a bit of memory per index (I haven't computed it precisely, but my guess is we save something like 24 bytes total per index by eliminating 1 pointer, which saves 8 bytes, and then could save us something like 16 bytes of padding). We also no longer can be in an inconsistent state where phashblock does not point to the entries own hash (although modifying phashblock once it is inserted into the map would be invalid -- it must be removed, modified, and reinserted).\r\n\r\nFuture work can likely further improve on this by making CBlockIndex owned* by the unordered_set directly, which will eliminate even more indirection/pointer chasing and make a lot of the code using BlockMap simpler (I don't think we ever rely on CBlockIndex being non-owned anywhere, nor should we have reason to in the future).\r\n\r\n\r\n* see https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_set, it will still be safe to use pointers for e.g., pprev.\r\n```\r\n     References and pointers to data stored in the container are only invalidated by erasing that element, even when the corresponding iterator is invalidated. \r\n```",

This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Original change description\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with assumeutxo, here's a brief summary from [the issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15605) (where any conceptual discussion not specific to this implementation should happen):\r\n\r\n> assumeutxo would be a way to initialize a node using a headers chain and a serialized version of the UTXO state which was generated from another node at some block height. A client making use of this UTXO \"snapshot\" would specify a hash and expect the content of the resulting UTXO set to yield this hash after deserialization. \r\n> \r\n> This would allow users to bootstrap a usable pruned node & wallet far more quickly (and with less disk usage) than waiting for a full initial block download to complete, since we only have to sync blocks between the base of the snapshot and the current network tip. Needless to say this is at expense of accepting a different trust model, though how different this really ends up being from `assumevalid` in effect is worth debate.\r\n\r\nIn short, this is an interesting change because it would allow nodes to get up and running within minutes given a ~3GB file (at time of writing) under an almost identical trust model to assumevalid.\r\n\r\nIn this implementation, I add a few RPC commands: `dumptxoutset` creates a UTXO snapshot and writes it to disk, and `loadtxoutset` intakes a snapshot from disk, constructs and activates chainstate based on it, and continues a from-scratch initial block download in the background for the sole purpose of validating the snapshot. Once the snapshot is validated, we throw away the chainstate used for background validation.\r\n\r\nThe assumeutxo procedure as implemented is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A UTXO snapshot is loaded with the `loadtxoutset <path>` RPC command.\r\n1. A new chainstate (`CChainState`) is initialized using `ChainstateManager::ActivateSnapshot()`:\r\n   1. The serialized UTXO data is read in and various sanity checks are performed, e.g. compare expected coin count, recompute the hash and compare it with assumeutxo hash in source code.\r\n   1. We \"fast forward\" `new_chainstate->m_chain` to have a tip at the base of the snapshot (with or without block data). Lacking block data, we fake the `nTx` counts of the constituent `CBlockIndex` entries.\r\n   1. `LoadChainTip()` is called on the new snapshot and it is installed as our active chainstate.\r\n1. The new assumed-valid chainstate is now our active, and so that enters IBD until it is synced to the network's tip. Presumably the snapshot would be taken relatively close to the current tip but far enough away to avoid meaningful reorgs, say 10,000 blocks deep.\r\n1. Once the active chainstate is out of IBD, our old validation chain continues IBD \"in the background\" while the active chainstate services requests from most of the system.\r\n1. Once the background validation chainstate reaches a height equal the base of the snapshot, we take the hash of its UTXO set and ensure it equals the expected hash based on the snapshot. If the hashes are equivalent, we delete the validation chainstate and move on without event; if they aren't, we log loudly and fall back to the validation chainstate (we should probably just shut down).\r\n\r\nThe implicit assumption is that the background validation chain will always be a subset of the assumed-valid snapshot chain while the latter is active. We don't properly handle reorgs that go deeper than the base of the snapshot.\r\n\r\n### Changes (already merged/outdated)\r\n\r\n![chainstate-beforeafter (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/54435797-a16b0780-4707-11e9-89c3-c90b5686804d.png)\r\n \r\nThe crux of this change is in removing any assumptions in the codebase that there is a single chainstate, i.e. any references to global variables `chainActive`, `pcoinsTip`, et al. need to be replaced with functions that return the relevant chainstate data at that moment in time. This change also takes `CChainState` to its logical conclusion by making it more self-contained - any references to globals like `chainActive` are removed with class-local references (`m_chain`).\r\n\r\nA few minor notes on the implementation:\r\n\r\n- When we attempt to load a wallet with a BestBlock locator lower than the base of a snapshot and the snapshot has not yet been validated, we refuse to load the wallet.\r\n\r\n- For additional notes, see [the new assumeutxo docs](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/blob/utxo-dumpload-compressed/doc/assumeutxo.md).",

          "body": "**This PR is a simple 3-line scripted diff followed by a documentation cleanup.** The scripted diff does three things:\r\n\r\n1. Deletes all existing `AssertLockHeld` calls. Since #19668, `AssertLockHeld` has had an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation which has guaranteed (though ongoing travis and cirrus CI builds since #19668 was merged) that these `AssertLockHeld` calls are redundant with `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` or `EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_FUNCTION` annotations already present in surrounding code, and specifically that:\r\n\r\n  - There is no way the assert calls can trigger any behavior at runtime.\r\n  - The assert calls provide no new thread safety information to the compiler.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Reverts `AssertLockHeld` implementation which got changed in #19668 to it's original pre-#19668 state. In #19668, `AssertLockHeld` was changed to have an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation instead of having an `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` annotation. As described above, having an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation on an assert statement is only useful as proof that the assert statement doesn't do anything or convey any new information. By contrast, having an `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` annotation on an assert statement can be an actually useful way of conveying to the compiler than a specific mutex is locked at a specific place in the code, when the compiler thread safety analysis can't determine that on its own (because of lost type information).\r\n\r\n3. Removes `LockAssertion` class, replacing all current uses with calls to `AssertLockHeld`. Ever since the `LockAssertion` class was first introduced in #14437 (as `LockAnnotation`), it has always been an inferior alternative to `AssertLockHeld` and not had a reason to exist. (#14437 was originally written before #13423 which added ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK annotation. It was justified when the code was first written, but no longer necessary by the time it was merged).\r\n\r\n**Motivation for this PR** is to get rid of confusion between different types of lock assertions and only keep one assertion: `AssertLockHeld` which goes back to the implementation it's had since #13423 was merged until #19668 was merged. After this PR, `AssertLockHeld` only needs to be used sparingly to augment compile-time thread safety annotations, which are a superior alternative to runtime checks for guaranteeing thread safety.\r\n\r\nPR is compared with alternatives in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/AssertLockHeld-PRs",

As noted in the PR description, C++20 will allow a simpler implementation of this because it adds `unordered_set` [`find`](https://www.cppstories.com/2021/heterogeneous-access-cpp20/) and `count` method overloads that can accept block hashes, instead of CBlockIndex pointers (heterogenous lookups, https://www.cppstories.com/2021/heterogeneous-access-cpp20/). But since the find method is mostly wrapped anyway and not called directly, this is not a big deal.",
