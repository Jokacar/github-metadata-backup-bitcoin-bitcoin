    "title": "bitcoin-qt failed assertion on startup",
    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nI ran bitcoin-qt the same way I always do, but it failed to start up. The terminal shows this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[New Thread 0x7fff337fe6c0 (LWP 4274)]\r\n[New Thread 0x7fff32ffd6c0 (LWP 4275)]\r\n[New Thread 0x7fff327fc6c0 (LWP 4276)]\r\n[New Thread 0x7fff31ffb6c0 (LWP 4277)]\r\n[New Thread 0x7fff317fa6c0 (LWP 4278)]\r\n[New Thread 0x7fff30ff96c0 (LWP 4279)]\r\n[New Thread 0x7fff23fff6c0 (LWP 4280)]\r\n[New Thread 0x7fff237fe6c0 (LWP 4281)]\r\nbitcoin-qt-v28.0: rpc/server.cpp:318: void StopRPC(): Assertion `!g_rpc_running' failed.\r\n\r\nThread 1 \"bitcoin-qt-v28.\" received signal SIGABRT, Aborted.\r\n__pthread_kill_implementation (threadid=<optimized out>, signo=signo@entry=6, no_tid=no_tid@entry=0) at ./nptl/pthread_kill.c:44\r\n44      ./nptl/pthread_kill.c: No such file or directory.\r\n(gdb) \r\n```\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nNot this.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI can't reproduce it. This is the first time it happened and I didn't change anything.\r\n\r\nI was typing when the splash screen popped up and grabbed keyboard focus. Is there something I could have typed at the splash screen or the \"loading wallets\" popup that could have caused this? I have since tried typing 'q' at the splash screen many times, but that appears to always cause a clean shutdown, not an assertion failure. Maybe I hit 'q' at just the wrong time, triggering a race condition in the shutdown code?\r\n\r\nI ran it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngdb -ex 'run -datadir=/path path/bitcoin/src/qt/bitcoin-qt-v28.0\r\n```\n\n### Relevant log output\n\nThe end of the debug.log file shows this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-11-14T14:23:38Z Using /16 prefix for IP bucketing\r\n2024-11-14T14:23:38Z init message: Loading P2P addresses…\r\n2024-11-14T14:23:38Z Loaded 58315 addresses from peers.dat  93ms\r\n2024-11-14T14:23:38Z init message: Loading banlist…\r\n2024-11-14T14:23:38Z SetNetworkActive: true\r\n2024-11-14T14:23:38Z Script verification uses 15 additional threads\r\n2024-11-14T14:23:38Z Cache configuration:\r\n2024-11-14T14:23:38Z * Using 2.0 MiB for block index database\r\n2024-11-14T14:23:38Z * Using 8.0 MiB for chain state database\r\n2024-11-14T14:23:38Z Shutdown requested.
