We’d only open a persistent outbound connection to peers which have a different netgroup compared to those netgroups present in `setConnected`.\r\n\r\n**behaviour on master**\r\n\r\nwe open persistent outbound connections to peers which have different netgroups compared to outbound full relay, block relay, addrfetch and feeler connection peers.\r\n\r\n**behaviour on PR**\r\n\r\nnetgroup diversity is based on outbound full relay, block relay and manual connection peers.\r\n\r\n**rationale**\r\n\r\n- addrfetch and feeler connections are short lived connections and shouldn’t affect how we select outbound peers from addrman.\r\n- manual connections are like regular connections when viewed from addrman’s netgroup diversity point of view and should affect how we select outbound peers from addrman",

          "body": "This PR improves the logic around netgroup diversity of new connections. More specifically, it improves privacy and fixes a couple things I consider buggy. It also adds a bunch of documentation. \r\n\r\nThis PR changes the following:\r\n1. prevents short-lived ADDR_FETCH and FEELER connections from affecting our further peer selection, because they are short-lived and should not matter\r\n2. ~~ADDR_FETCH and FEELER conns are now not included in `count_failure` consideration (see new documentation). Even though it *makes sense* to consider them if they are present at the moment of the call, we should not rely on that luck. Instead, we should be explicit.~~\r\n3. ~Prevents BLOCK_RELAY connections from affecting our further full-relay peer selection, because otherwise, an attacker with sufficient ADDR-related capabilities may infer to which netgroups those (supposedly more private) connections belong.~ Abandoning this feature for now because the trade-offs are unclear, see P2P meeting at #bitcoin-core-dev from Sept. 8.\r\n4. Look at the existing MANUAL peers when enforcing diversity of new outbound conns.\r\n\r\n~I’m also not sure whether *new* BLOCK_RELAY connections should be distinct w.r.t *existent* full outbound connections. Seems like another influence vector for an attacker with AddrMan poisoning capabilities, but this threat is probably too advanced. And having a good diversity of BLOCK_RELAY conns is very beneficial.~",

This increases privacy and will also make it harder to perform fingerprinting attacks (connecting our identities over different networks).\r\n\r\nManual Block-Relay connections:\r\n- can be specified with `-addnode` RPC, both with the `add` and `onetry` command\r\n- can be specified with the `-addnode` bitcoind arg (or in bitcoin.conf) with `<IP>=manual-block-relay`\r\n- don't participate in transaction and address relay\r\n- don't get discouraged / punished for misbehavior (but will still get disconnected for sending TX/tx-INV as automatic block-relay-only peers do)\r\n- are not subject to outbound eviction logic (unlike automatic block-relay-only-peers)\r\n",

In general, I think we should use asserts very sparingly in p2p code (only in situations where not crashing would lead to serious problems), because of the risk of future remote crash bugs.",

As best as I can tell, @lightlike's [reason for doing so](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19860#issuecomment-1023522150) seems to be the strongest reason:\r\n\r\n> On the other hand, even if you do trust them, there could still be attacks on an ISP level that would apply to multiple nodes from one group, so I think it makes sense to include them in the diversification as well.\r\n\r\nI think that makes sense to me.  However, it occurred to me that for networks where we have authenticated connections -- I2P, onion, CJDNS(?) -- that this argument would not apply.  Moreover I guess doing any kind of \"netgroup\"-based diversification for these peers doesn't make sense, since for those addresses, our group assignments are arbitrary and there's no relationship between the address and our route?  (If that understanding is correct then that is a separate issue from the improvement here, so could be picked up in another PR.)",

      "body": "> Moreover I guess doing any kind of \"netgroup\"-based diversification for these peers doesn't make sense, since for those addresses, our group assignments are arbitrary and there's no relationship between the address and our route? (If that understanding is correct then that is a separate issue from the improvement here, so could be picked up in another PR.)\r\n\r\nI agree, and I think there is another problem that is exacerbated by this PR:\r\n\r\nThe grouping is not just arbitrary for these networks, it also prevents us from making connections to addresses from groups we are already connected to, which is a real issue here because there are only 16 possible netgroups for each of the non-clearnet networks (see [NetGroupManager::GetGroup()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4c6b7d330a4e80460dcce19b1a0a47d77a0b99ea/src/netgroup.cpp#L17),  the code is not exactly trivial to understand though)\r\nSo if we're `-onlynet=onion` (or i2p, cjdns) and choose 8 manual connections, each from a different group, these count for `setConnected` after this PR. If we then make 8 full outbound connections we have one connection to each possible netgroup - so that we wouldn't be able to make block-relay-only connections anymore!\r\nI think we should do something about that for 25.0, I believe @stratospher would be interested in doing that as a follow-up?",

This does not apply however for Tor, I2P and CJDNS where the address is \"random\" bytes. Actually, Tor, I2P and CJDNS addresses that have common prefix are _harder_ to obtain than ones that don't have a common prefix (the opposite compared to IP).\r\n\r\nCurrently `NetGroupManager::GetGroup()` is doing prefixing on Tor, I2P and CJDNS addresses and assumes same properties apply as for IP addresses. This magically \"works\" to some extent but has drawbacks. Some serious changes are needed to remove that assumption from the code.\r\n\r\nSee\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22563\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27264#issuecomment-1481322628\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\n* Don't do prefixing on Tor, I2P and CJDNS and don't assume proximity based on that.\r\n* Treat all addresses from Tor as one group (because it is very easy to obtain huge amount of them). Same for I2P and CJDNS.\r\n* Make sure addrman can still store enough addresses from those networks.\r\n* Make sure a single source from Tor, I2P and CJDNS cannot flood addrman with junk due to the previous point.\r\n",

We’d only open a persistent outbound connection to peers which have a different netgroup compared to those netgroups present in `setConnected`.\r\n\r\nCurrent `GetGroup()` logic assumes route-based diversification behaviour for tor/i2p/cjdns addresses (addresses are public key based and not route-based). Distinct netgroups possible (according to the current `GetGroup()` logic) for:\r\n1. tor => 030f, 031f, .. 03ff (16 possibilities)\r\n2. i2p => 040f, 041f, .. 04ff (16 possibilities)\r\n3. cjdns => 05fc0f, 05fc1f, ... 05fcff (16 possibilities)\r\n\r\n`setConnected` is used in `ThreadOpenConnections()` before making [outbound](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/84f4ac39fda7ffa5dc84e92d92dd1eeeb5e20f8c/src/net.cpp#L1846) and [anchor](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/84f4ac39fda7ffa5dc84e92d92dd1eeeb5e20f8c/src/net.cpp#L1805) connections to new peers so that they belong to distinct netgroups.\r\n\r\n**behaviour on master**\r\n\r\n- if we run a node only on tor/i2p/cjdns\r\n\t- we wouldn't be able to open more than 16 outbound connections(manual, block-relay-only anchor, outbound full relay, block-relay-only connections) because we run out of possible netgroups.\r\n\t- see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27264#issuecomment-1481322628\r\n\t- tested by changing `MAX_OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY_CONNECTIONS` to 17 with `onlynet=onion` and observed how node wouldn't make more than 16 outbound connections.\r\n\r\n**behaviour on PR**\r\n\r\n- netgroup diversity checks are skipped for tor/i2p/cjdns addresses. \r\n- we don't insert tor/i2p/cjdns address in `setConnected` and `GetGroup` doesn't get called on tor/i2p/cjdns(see #27369)\r\n",

          "body": "# Session Details\r\n- Date: 13-04-2023\r\n- Time: IST 20:00 (UTC 14:30)\r\n- PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27374\r\n- Context: `[Net][P2P]`\r\n- Difficulty: Moderate\r\n- Language: `[python][c++]`\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n* There are 2 main types of P2P connections \r\n    - Inbound connections = if your peer initiates the connection\r\n    - Outbound connection = if you initiate the connection to your peer\r\n* See all P2P connection types [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d544d03ba6c7ed3c5879c8bc1108f45d0aac2798/src/node/connection_types.h#L17-L77).\r\n* It might be possible for a malicious adversary to consume all your inbound connection slots. So it's important to select a diverse set of IP addresses for your outbound connections in order to be more resilient against [eclipse attacks](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eclipse-attacks/).\r\n* Netgroups/Network groups are used to understand IP address diversity. See [`GetGroup()` in `src/netgroup.h`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d544d03ba6c7ed3c5879c8bc1108f45d0aac2798/src/netgroup.h#L25-L35).\r\n* [#27264](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27264) changed the logic of how peers from diverse netgroups were selected for establishing outbound connections.\r\n    * before, we used to open persistent outbound connections to peers which have different netgroups compared to outbound full relay, block relay, addrfetch and feeler connection peers.\r\n    * now, we open persistent outbound connections to peers which have different netgroups compared to outbound full relay, block relay and manual connection peers.\r\n* However, Tor/I2P/CJDNS networks have only 16 possible distinct network groups. Network groups for Tor/I2P/CJDNS networks don't make sense since they are public key based network and not routing based. Also, they use only [4 variable bits](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d544d03ba6c7ed3c5879c8bc1108f45d0aac2798/src/netgroup.cpp#L50-L57) in the `GetGroup()` logic resulting in 2**4 possibilities for netgroups. \r\n* Bitcoin core allows 8 manual connections maximum and 8 outbound full relay connections maximum by default.\r\n* So problem happens when you run a bitcoin core node on Tor-only (or I2P, CJDNS). If all these 8 + 8 connections have distinct netgroups, we don't have netgroups remaining for [block relay only connections](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/112829/136416).\r\n* Moreover, netgroup diversity when opening persitent outbound connections doesn't conceptually make sense in Tor/I2P/CJDNS since their IP addresses are not route-based.\r\n\r\n# Conceptual Questions\r\n1. What are different types of outbound connections? Can you point region in code where these connections are established? hint: look in [`ThreadOpenConnections()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d544d03ba6c7ed3c5879c8bc1108f45d0aac2798/src/net.cpp#L1611)\r\n2. What's a netgroup? Why is netgroup diversity important when making an outbound connection?\r\n3. How is netgroup diversity maintained when establishing outbound connections? hint: [#27264](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27264)\r\n\r\n# PR related Questions\r\n1. Did you review the PR? Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK? What was your review approach?\r\n2. What problem does this PR solve?\r\n3. Why skip netgroup diversity checks when establishing outbound connections to Tor/I2P/CJDNS networks?\r\n5. What does `fCountFailure` do?\r\n6. What would happen if `outbound_privacy_network_peers` was absent in the code?\r\n7. optional: why increasing 4 bits to 5 bits in [GetGroup() logic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d544d03ba6c7ed3c5879c8bc1108f45d0aac2798/src/netgroup.cpp#L50-L57) (to increase total number of possible netgroups for Tor/I2P/CJDNS from 16 possibilities to 2**5 possibilities) isn't desirable.\r\n\r\n# Learning\r\n - Net\r\n - In/OutBound connections\r\n - Net Grouping\r\n> Note: Drop your PR and review related questions below",
