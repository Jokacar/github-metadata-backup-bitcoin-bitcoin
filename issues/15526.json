          "body": "Hello ,\r\n\r\nI have built daemon,cli from multiwallet branch(0.17).Tried to load and unload multiwallet using RPC(dynamically) from the response it seems its unloaded as per API response.\r\n\r\nAnd due to exceeding ram usage daemon is getting crashed.\r\n\r\nAbove findings i found by following below cases.\r\n\r\nUsing `loadwallet` api wallets are loading and I can make api request to that wallet.After loading multiple wallet dynamically using REST api i check memory usage.\r\n\r\nAfter that I've unloaded wallet using `unloadwallet` REST api and observed the memory usage which should be lesser compare to at the time of wallets are loaded.But it showing same percentage or same mb/kb usage in both case(`loadwallet` & after unloading wallet)\r\n\r\nSo by unloading wallet i guess wallets objects are not getting released from the memory.And its increasing the memory usage and daemon getting crashed.\r\n\r\nSimilar issue([15526](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15526)) was reported on Bitcoin too.And tried to make changes from bitcoin to litecoin source but faced same issue might be missing something.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan anyone please provide input or help me to resolve this issue ?\r\nThanks,",
