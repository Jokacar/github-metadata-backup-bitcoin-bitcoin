Could the hash algorithm be modified in following way:\r\n\r\n- transactions are valid (every address that wants to send something actually has that something)\r\n- block template is ready (list of all transactions available to that mining node)\r\n- the hash of each nonce should have an *additional* final hash that is based on a lookup in the blockchain raw data itself\r\n\r\nThe idea is to bring the PoW back to a machine that has resources similar to a PC (which may be closer to Satoshi's original vision), namely a lot of RAM or HDD.\r\n\r\nFor example if the hash of the block is :\r\nSHA-256 Hash: d1bde2f3a4b5d8df0b556b256abf479f9a0f0a9ec2071a1d1e2d2ea21e5ce10d\r\n\r\nThen each of the characters above like d , 1, b , d ... etc would have to do some lookup that goes in binary mode through the entire blockchain content (500+ GB at the moment).\r\n\r\nChatGPT's take on it https://chat.openai.com/share/6264dca8-644e-402b-ae5b-f3382f8fbc8f\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
