    "body": "It would be nice to have documentation on how to set up a basic M-of-N multisig between multiple people using descriptor wallets and PSBTs, as well as a signing flow.\r\n\r\nE.g. (borrowed some steps from @jonasschnelli)\r\n\r\n- First phase: generate and exchange `xpub`s:\r\n  - Every participant generates an `xpub`: most straightforward is to create a new wallet, I guess, but how to get the `xpub` to share for a specific BIP32 path?\r\n  - Maybe #21277 helps here *but* it might be putting the cart before the horse: do we want the default non-multisig descriptors at all here? I don't think so.\r\n  - Share it with the other participants.\r\n- Second phase: Every participant imports the following descriptors using `importdescriptors`:\r\n  - Receiving  (`internal: false`) addresses are `wsh(sortedmulti(<M>,xpubA/0/*,xpubB/0/*,xpubC/0/*,…))`\r\n  - Change (`internal: true`) addresses are `wsh(sortedmulti(<M>,xpubA/1/*,xpubB/1/*,xpubC/1/*,…))`\r\n- Send funds to the resulting address (every participant should get the same addresses).\r\n- When making a sending transaction create one using `walletcreatefundedpsbt` (everyone can initiate this)\r\n  - Send the resulting PSBT to other users\r\n  - At least M users checks it with `decodepsbt` then (if ok) signs it with `walletprocesspsbt`\r\n  - Collect the signed PSBTs with `joinpsbts` then broadcast the resulting transaction\r\n",

The latter seems to have been [NACKed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21199#issuecomment-780772418) by @sipa (and I agree, this seems cleaner).\r\n\r\nI agree that PSBTs should be used.  @hugohn 's standard doesn't currently cover that (sending/creating).",

Use muti-sig wallet and quorum-based voting to create real-world Bitcoin payouts. Sync the vote progress with others, visualise as votes come in (approve or reject) and display the undecided votes. Any developer can contribute code to the DAO and get paid. It disconnects the DAO from any bank, government, and legal system. Help create a global economy that is hyper-efficient, fair, honest, and digital. [prior work](https://github.com/Tribler/trustchain-superapp/blob/7a958aec39b89b8a7015d508ef440553a0403788/currencyii/README.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n### General Description - self-evolving AI-DAO (https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/issues/5944)\r\nStudent from Delft have created a blockchain-based alternative to Spotify. Completely decentralised. Uses Bittorrent for streaming, Bitcoin for payments to artists, Trustchain with IPv8 for music discovery and IPv8 for app-to-app connectivity. With multiple teams the aim is to take this code to the next level: self-evolution.\r\n\r\nA total of 4 students teams (4-5 students in each team) will work together on a cutting-edge scientific problem: how to create a software system which can be expanded in real-time and increasingly become more '_intelligent_'. Build upon the existing open source app by TUDelft on the Android Play store using blockchain technology: the [Superapp](https://github.com/Tribler/trustchain-superapp/). You will help transform essential parts of the music industry and replace them with open source software. Current code:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>GIF: Browsing and streaming music with Bittorrent </summary>\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4957928/103173843-e5d48280-485d-11eb-907a-e20c9b25fbba.gif\" width=250/>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>GIF: Sending money to artists using Bitcoin</summary>\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4957928/103173848-e836dc80-485d-11eb-9863-660601a5ddf7.gif\" width=250/>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### DAO - organisations in software\r\nTo make a \"self-evolving\" app we use the DAO concept. What is a DAO? Within the coming decades the future of jobs, employment and the nature of the firm will change profoundly. Automation, AI, and robots will replace many of today's jobs. A new type of company is a company without any employees, without any machines or physical infrastructure. A Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, DAO, only exists in software. It goes beyond smart contracts, it is a complete company inside software. DAO development is still in the experimental stage. Background reading. Very optimistic [view on DAO](https://hackernoon.com/the-state-of-the-daos-b7cba318460b), official [US review of DAO](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/investreport/34-81207.pdf) by Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\n\r\nWithin this master course you can create your very own autonomous organisation, the AI-DAO. Learn to engineer a decentralised autonomous organisation, use the existing tools, and understand the security risks. The aim is to alter the nature of the firm in the Internet age, [see the Nobel prize winning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm). Production cost become essentially cost-free. An organisation which exists purely in cyberspace. The AI-DAO is designed to be the first sustainable DAO. How can we empower leaderless organizations? How can it earn money from manipulating bits? \r\n\r\n### Scientific challenge: Self-evolving\r\nA key step in an autonomous system is that it can evolve independently. This enables growth and evolution independently of any central organisation, sponsoring government, or tribe of volunteers.\r\n\r\nYou will collectively solve the problem of paying somebody to make new features in open systems which are fully decentralised. This goes further then paying somebody Bitcoins to create a new version. Decentralised technology is very robust to failures, manipulation, faults, and courtcases. For instance, The Internet itself is almost impossible to shutdown so is the \"Tor darknet\". With other teams you will address a key drawback of decentralised technology: difficult to update, nearly impossible to evolve, and lacks incentives to develop new features. \r\n\r\n### dApp ecosystem\r\n\"Distributed Applications\" are a distributed way of running code. You will help develop an ecosystem of \"global code\". Code is running atop a blockchain and peer-to-peer (P2P) network that acts as a kind of operating system. This provides security, resilience, privacy, and novel features. This is related to smart contracts, but has no slow single virtual machine (all discussed in the online classes material).

          "body": "I'd like to continue the discussion from [#17395](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17395) over at the bitcoin repo started by @michaelfolkson. \r\n\r\nThe two questions posed by Michael a long with summarized replies from the original thread are below. As someone who is interested in contributing to the design of the GUI I've also included some of my own opinions throughout. \r\n\r\n> 1. Who are we designing the GUI for? Long term Core contributors (highly technical) that use the GUI on a regular basis? I don't know how many of these there are. Technically curious who use the GUI when they can't work out how to do something from the command line? Complete Bitcoin beginners? All of these groups? If it is the latter then we should all be under no illusions that compromises are necessary which will mean it is impossible for the design to be optimal for an individual group.\r\n\r\n> 2. Design preferences are subject to the \"sample size of 1\" trap where those reviewing GUI changes think they are providing feedback on behalf of a group that they don't belong to. A highly technical user just does not know what is optimal for a beginner. The only way you see what is optimal for a beginner is putting alternative GUIs in the hands of a statistically significant group of beginners.\r\n\r\n- The GUI is intended for 'power users,' not beginners, intermediate or devs. Power users being those who are technically competent to run their own node, have basic CLI skills, but are still more comfortable with a simpler UI.\r\n\r\nI think devs also fall within the user base albeit not as frequent as the power users (say if the dev wants to do a simple task in a few clicks). Over time and with good design we can include all users (see below).\r\n\r\n- In the future the GUI should also include beginners and intermediate users, although not at the expense of removing important features or negatively impacting security, privacy, control etc. \r\n\r\nI don't see this as an issue as good design should be able to cater to both experienced and inexperienced users. As an example see [this exchange](https://medium.com/lgogroup/introducing-lgos-trading-interface-77967e4e108e) which offers different interfaces for differing user skills - taken from [crypto UX handbook](https://www.cryptouxhandbook.com/user-onboarding). Good usability is synonymous with good security - Casa articulates this much better in their [wealth security protocol.](https://docs.keys.casa/wealth-security-protocol/system-design-principles/usability-is-security) \r\n\r\n- The GUI does not need to be flashy / modern looking.\r\n\r\nI agree with this but this is in many ways unrelated to good design. A flashy look can increase usability is not synonymous with Aesthetics. As long as its fulfills its job thats all the matters. At this stage that job being having any level of user being able to run a node and have a wallet attached to that node (whether wallet features are used in the GUI or \r\n\r\n- Designers need to work within the constraints of Qt.\r\n\r\nGood point to make but I don't think the constraints are as big as made out to be in the original thread. As Christoph Ono, who worked on the designs for the Monero GUI which also uses Qt, pointed out a small team managed to revamp the UI/UX of the GUI over a few years without too many issues, see [here](https://github.com/GBKS/monero-wallet-design). @GBKS \r\n\r\n- Having a modular GUI / multiple implementations to cater to different user bases.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above I think good design can cater to all audiences within the same app, having a modular GUI is not an efficient way to go about things in my opinion.  \r\n\r\n- What is the main purpose of the GUI? _\"Note that the GUI is needed for more than just the wallet... right now, it is the only realistic way for a normal end user to run their own node at all.\"_ @luke-jr \r\n\r\nLuke also mentions \"...Bitcoin's security depends on a super-majority of the economy using their own full node.\" This isn't possible without including beginner and intermediate users which can only be done through well articulated design. \r\n\r\nAlthough this will likely be a controversial take, is the discontinuation of the GUI once enough options exist outside of core for users to run a fully validating node an option? Projects such as [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel) and [myNode](https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode) are good examples of non-GUI fully validating nodes. If these become more popular among users for running a node than the GUI, is the resources put into it worthwhile when they could be applied to making bitcoins foundations even stronger?\r\n\r\n- Many usability improvements are being worked on on the technical side - [1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16966) [2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9483) [3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7949)\r\n\r\nWith initiatives such as [Bitcoin Design](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign) and [square crypto design grants](https://medium.com/@squarecrypto/bringing-together-the-bitcoin-design-community-b89e5fbe080f) on offer, many more designers are likely to start contributing to open source bitcoin projects like the GUI. It's important that discussions like this happen so that designers and devs are on the same page. \r\n\r\nI'd encourage devs to join the [bitcoin design slack](https://join.slack.com/t/bitcoindesign/shared_invite/zt-fv00xzev-mfHaAsexPsu~QBlufPxL~g) and for designers to frequent this repo and join in on discussions when they can. \r\n",
