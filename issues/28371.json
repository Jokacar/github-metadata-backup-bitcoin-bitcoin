    "body": "While investigating an issue with a non-propagating transaction with @TheBlueMatt, it occurred to us that it can be a problem for a node to get its transactions relayed when it's surrounded solely by low-mempool-limit peers (which correspondingly have a high announced minfeefilter value). And it appears this is detectable too, as our own `mempoolminfee` would be lower.\r\n\r\nWhile obviously relay can't be guaranteed, this is a detectable situation, and it could factor into the outbound replacement logic and/or trigger something similar to the \"seek more peers\" behavior we exhibit when we appear to be not getting blocks.\r\n",

      "body": "What about discouraging outbound peers with a mempool -say- 80% smaller than ours? It seems useful in general, would solve this situation for transactions with a reasonable fee attached, and for transactions with a fee such as it would be under 60MB of unconfirmed transactions.. it's the application's responsibility to prevent this?\r\n\r\nI understand for Lightning's commitment transactions you rely on your peer to cosign a feerate update, but you would most likely have dropped to chain before getting in a situation where you are holding a commit tx whose feerate is lower than that of 60MB worth of unconfirmed transactions?\r\n\r\nWe should probably check what the node-in-a-box projects set as `-maxmempool` too.",

      "body": "From my understanding of the current state of #27742 (package relay code), `m_fee_filter_received` is not looked on during the composition of the `ANCPKGINFO` reply in `ProcessGetData` / `MaybeGetAncPkgInfo`, neither in the further processing of complementary missing package txn relay at `GETPKGTXNS` so effectively package relay deployment should be a good hardening for time-sensitive lightning transactions with a pre-signed feerate, assuming Lightning node / softwares responsibly RBFing / CPFPing their low-feerate txn as timelock expiration is approaching.\r\n\r\nI think there is still a longer concern about a majority of low-mempool-limit peers (i.e low-value `-maxmempool`) screwing up the transaction-relay of low-feerate lightning transactions and therefore delaying the confirmation of those ones, or at least making not seen by the miners mempools and so _artificially fee-bumping them as timelocks expiration is approaching. So low-mempool-limit peers with a fee-filter not representing miners / default full-nodes mempool setting might be an individual source of failure for transaction-relay propagation and holistically a waste in fee-bumping reserves for Lightning nodes. \r\n\r\nI think it might makes sense in the long-term to discourage (or preferentially evict them) tx-relay peers with relatively lower mempool size than ours. I guess it would be better to get back on the table https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20726 and BIP338 (clean up of features flow negotiated with peers) before we complexify discourage / peers disconnection on local node settings.",

I'm looking at Amazon right now, and the supermajority of Raspberry Pi's for sale are 4GB or higher, with only a few 2GB models and just one 1GB model (in the first page of results). The default is 300MB of actual RAM usage, which is just 15% of a 2GB RPi's available RAM. I'm also not aware of any RPi node software with a non-default max mempool.\r\n\r\nI've you've actually observed a problem that appears to be this, I'd be more inclined to suspect a cause like a sybil attack of badly written chainalysis tx monitoring nodes.",
