    "body": "While reviewing #28331 we noticed a crash that wasn't caught by the test suite, but would very quickly happen on a real node. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28331#discussion_r1342450439\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce it by calling `addnode` twice and having the test suite wait a little bit. But this also involved hacking `ThreadOpenAddedConnections` to wait 1 second instead of a full minute. See https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/commit/bc3995c66300fb3139c5360e8f6ee807b02ea86e\r\n\r\nIf the test suite could mock the delay in `ThreadOpenAddedConnections` we can add a regular test for this.\r\n\r\nIt would also be a good idea to test `MAX_ADDNODE_CONNECTIONS`, which should be a simple matter of spinning up ~10 test nodes.",

The reason being that in the unit test we have greater control of the internals of the program. This would allow us to create a `CConnman` object with mocked `interruptNet` member which sleeps less than requested and call its `ThreadOpenAddedConnections()` method. This would also be useful in fuzz tests like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28584 where the sleep is only slowing down the execution.",
