    "body": "`m_is_inbound` cannot be changed throughout the life of a `Peer`. However, we are currently storing it in `CNodeState`, which requires locking `cs_main` in order to access it. This can be moved to the outside scope and only require `m_peer_mutex`.\r\n\r\nThis is a refactor in preparation for Erlay reworks.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

      "body": "> Concept ACK. Mind sharing how you see this fitting in with Erlay work?\r\n> \r\n> Will review in more depth soon.\r\n\r\nSure. For Erlay purposes, some transactions need to be sent via fanout even to Erlay-enabled peers. In order to know to how many peers to send this via fanout, we need to count the amount of tx-relaying peers that we have, both inbound and outbound.\r\n \r\nThis is done, in the current patch, by going over all peers when constructing their corresponding INV message and deciding whether to add the transaction or not (this requires accesing the `CNodeState`, which involves locking `cs_main`). In the new revision, this would be done in `PeerManagerImpl::RelayTransaction`, and two sets will be kept, per peer, one for fanout and one for reconciliation. \r\n\r\nTL;DR; checking if a peer is inbound from the `PeerManager` perspective should not require locking `cs_main`",

          "title": "net_processing: make any misbehavior trigger immediate discouragement",
          "body": "So far, discouragement of peers triggers when their misbehavior score exceeds 100 points. Most types of misbehavior increment the score by 100, triggering immediate discouragement, but some types do not. This PR makes all increments equal to either 100 (meaning any misbehavior will immediately cause disconnection and discouragement) or 0 (making the behavior effectively unconditionally allowed), and then removes the logic for score accumulation.\r\n\r\nThis simplifies the code a bit, but also makes protocol expectations clearer: if a peer misbehaves, they get disconnected. There is no good reason why certain types of protocol violations should be permitted 4 times (howmuch=20) or 9 times (howmuch=10), while many others are never allowed. Furthermore, the distinction between these looks arbitrary.\r\n\r\nTo assess whether this does not unduly affect existing other software on the network, I've been running this with an additional patch (see https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commits/202403_nomisbehave_log) that adds logging whenever behavior is detected whose misbehavior increment is changed to 100 by this PR. Over the past day I have not seen any instances on my well-connected node (~150 incoming connections), but will continue to monitor.\r\n\r\nThe specific types of misbehavior that are changed to 100 are:\r\n* Sending us a `block` which does not connect to our header tree (which necessarily must have been unsollicited). [used to be score 10]\r\n* Sending us a `headers` with a non-continuous headers sequence. [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 1000 addresses in a single `addr` or `addrv2` message [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 50000 invs in a single `inv` message [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 2000 headers in a single `headers` message [used to be score 20]\r\n\r\nThe specific types of misbehavior that are changed to 0 are:\r\n* Sending us 10 (*) separate BIP130 headers announcements that do not connect to our block tree [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 8 headers in a single `headers` message (which thus does not get treated as a BIP130 announcement) that does not connect to our block tree. [used to be score 10]\r\n\r\nI believe that none of these behaviors are unavoidable, except for the one marked (*) which can in theory happen still due to interaction between BIP130 and variations in system clocks (the max 2 hour in the future rule). This one has been removed entirely. In order to remove the impact of the bug it was designed to deal with, without relying on misbehavior, a separate improvement is included that makes `getheaders`-tracking more accurate.\r\n\r\nIn another unrelated improvement, this also gets rid of the 8 header limit heuristic to determine whether an incoming non-connecting `headers` is a potential BIP130 announcement, as this rule is no longer needed to prevent spurious Misbehavior. Instead, any non-connecting `headers` is now treated as a potential announcement.",

This is the most recent time that this peer was the first to notify our node of a new block (one that we didn't already know about), or zero if this peer has never been the first to notify us of a new block. This timestamp already exists internally and is used for stale-tip eviction logic; this PR exposes it at the RPC layer.\r\n\r\nThis PR started out as a suggestion for additional test coverage, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26172#issuecomment-1259678260. It turned out that the easiest way to test (already-merged) #26172 is to add this field to `getpeerinfo` and have a functional test verify its value. But it may also be useful to have this result in its own right, similar to that RPC's existing `last_block` field -- it indicates something about the quality of our peers. It allows one to predict which peer will be evicted when the stale tip logic activates. (I'm not sure if that would be useful, but it may be.)\r\n\r\nThe functional test added here fails without #26172, which is the main goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not test the actual stale-tip eviction logic; that's difficult to do with a functional test. But it does test the correctness of the timestamp that the eviction logic depends on. #23352 is an attempt to test the eviction logic using a unit test, it's not ready to be merged yet. I think having both kinds of tests would be beneficial.",

          "body": "See #27463 for full project tracking.\r\n\r\nThis contains the first few commits of #30110, which require some thinking about thread safety in review.\r\n- Introduce a new `m_tx_download_mutex` which guards the transaction download data structures including `m_txrequest`, the rolling bloom filters, and `m_orphanage`. Later this should become the mutex guarding `TxDownloadManager`.\r\n  - `m_txrequest` doesn't need to be guarded using `cs_main` anymore\r\n  - `m_recent_confirmed_transactions` doesn't need its own lock anymore\r\n  - `m_orphanage` doesn't need its own lock anymore\r\n- Adds a new `ValidationInterface` event, `UpdatedBlockTipSync`, which is a synchronous version of `UpdatedBlockTip`.\r\n- Flush `m_recent_rejects` and `m_recent_rejects_reconsiderable` on `UpdatedBlockTipSync` just once instead of every time `AlreadyHaveTx` is called. This should speed up calls to that function and removes the need to lock `cs_main` every time it is called.\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n- These data structures need synchronization (for example, something that goes into the `m_orphanage` should not be added to `m_txrequest`. In the future, orphan resolution tracking should also be synchronized. Currently, `cs_main` is used to e.g. sync accesses to `m_txrequest`. We should not broaden the scope of things it locks.\r\n- Currently, we need to know the current chainstate every time we call `AlreadyHaveTx` so we can decide whether we should update it. Every call compares the current tip hash with `hashRecentRejectsChainTip`. It is more efficient to have a validation interface callback that updates the rejection filters whenever the chain tip changes.",

Transaction download logic refers to the process of deciding what transactions to request, download, and validate.[1]\r\nAll of the changes here should result in no behavior change.\r\n\r\nThere are several benefits to this interface, such as:\r\n- Unit test coverage and **F U Z Z I N G** for logic that currently isn't feasible to test as thoroughly (due to the code paths not being reachable through `PeerManager` without a ton of overhead) and/or currently only lightly tested through `assert_debug_log` ( :-1: ) in functional tests.\r\n    - See for example the `MempoolRejectedTx` test, where we can define a matrix of expected outcomes for each `TxValidationResult` and test them very easily.\r\n    - For fuzzing, see the `txdownloadman` and `txdownload_impl` targets.\r\n- When we add more functionality (e.g. package relay messages, more robust orphan handling), the vast majority of it will be within `TxDownloadManager` instead of `PeerManager`, making it easier to review and test.\r\n- A thinner and easier-to-use interface for `PeerManager`, which will no longer know anything about / have access to `TxOrphanage` or rejection caches. Its primary interface with `TxDownloadManager` would be:\r\n    - Notify `txdownloadman` of tip changes (i.e. passing on some `ValidationInterface` callbacks)\r\n    - Tell `txdownloadman`when a {transaction, package} is {accepted, rejected} from mempool, and receive a few instructions\r\n    - Each time a peer connects or disconnects + sanity check functions during cleanup\r\n    - Pass transaction `inv`s, `notfound`s to `txdownloadman` and receive instructions on what to validate\r\n    - Get the `getdata` requests to send\r\n    - Get the transactions to reconsider in `ProcessOrphanTx`\r\n    - Get whether a peer `HaveMoreWork` for the `ProessMessages` loop\r\n    - ^note that there are some cleanups I still have to do, so it's not this clean yet, but this is the vision. For example, while I'm writing this, I plan to make `Find1P1CPackage` private to `TxDownloadImpl`\r\n    - ^in the future, it would also pass package-related messages on, and we would reuse the `PackageToValidate` struct to return the things `peerman` needs for validation.\r\n- (todo) with some more interface changes, we can make this manager internally thread-safe instead of having `PeerManager` handle it (e.g. currently it locks `cs_main` to synchronize accesses to `m_txrequest`!)\r\n\r\n[1]: This does not include transaction announcements, i.e. what we *send* to our peers. All of that happens after we download/accept a tx. Txreconciliation (erlay) is excluded from this module, as it is part of announcements and/or part of helping the other peer decide which `inv`s to send.",
