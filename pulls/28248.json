    "body": "Fix the current behavior in `ThreadOpenConnections` of making automatic outbound connections to already connected inbound cjdns peers.\r\n\r\nFix addnode cjdns peers not currently detected as connected by `GetAddedNodeInfo`, causing `ThreadOpenAddedConnections` to continually retry to connect to them and RPC `getaddednodeinfo` incorrectly showing them as not connected.\r\n\r\nDo not make automatic outbound connections in `ThreadOpenConnections` to addnode peers, in order to not allocate our limited outbound slots to them and to ensure addnode connections benefit from their intended protections. Our addnode logic usually connects the addnode peers before the automatic outbound logic does, but not always, as a connection race can occur (see mainnet examples in the commit message). When an addnode peer is connected as an automatic outbound peer and is the only connection we have to a network, it can be protected by our new outbound network-specific eviction logic and persist in the \"wrong role\". Fix these issues by checking if the selected address is an addnode peer in our automatic outbound connection logic.\r\n\r\nUpdate the p2p logging with the improvements that allowed seeing/understanding/debugging the current behavior. Please see the commit messages for details.\r\n\r\nSimplify `MaybePickPreferredNetwork` to return `std::optional`, make it a const class method, and add Clang thread-safety analysis annotation and related assertions.\r\n",

          "body": "This is joint work with mzumsande. \r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to diversify outbound connections with respect to reachable networks. The existing logic evaluates peers for connection based purely on the frequency of available addresses in `AddrMan`. This PR adds logic to automatically connect to alternate reachable networks and adds eviction logic that protects one existing connection to each network. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if `AddrMan` is populated primarily with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and only a handful of onion addresses, it is likely that we won't establish any automatic outbound connections to Tor, even if we're capable of doing so. For smaller networks like CJDNS, this is even more of an issue and often requires adding manual peers to ensure regularly being connected to the network.\r\n\r\nConnecting to multiple networks improves resistance to eclipse attacks for individual nodes. It also benefits the entire p2p network by increasing partition resistance and privacy in general. \r\n\r\nThe automatic connections to alternate networks is done defensively, by first filling all outbound slots with random addresses (as in the status quo) and then adding additional peers from reachable networks the node is currently not connected to. This approach ensures that outbound slots are not left unfilled while attempting to connect to a network that may be unavailable due to a technical issue or misconfiguration that bitcoind cannot detect.\r\n\r\nOnce an additional peer is added and we have one more outbound connection than we want, outbound eviction ensures that peers are protected if they are the only ones for their network.\r\n\r\nManual connections are also taken into account: If a user already establishes manual connections to a trusted peer from a network, there is no longer a need to make extra efforts to ensure we also have an automatic connection to it (although this may of course happen by random selection). \r\n",

          "title": "Improves addnode / m_added_nodes logic",
          "body": "## Rationale\r\n\r\nCurrently, `addnode` has a couple of corner cases that allow it to either connect to the same peer more than once, hence wasting outbound connection slots, or add redundant information to `m_added_nodes`, hence making Bitcoin iterate through useless data on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n### Connecting to the same node more than once\r\n\r\nIn general, connecting to the same node more than once is something we should try to prevent. Currently, this is possible via `addnode` in two different ways:\r\n\r\n1. Calling `addnode` more than once in a short time period, using two equivalent but distinct addresses\r\n2. Calling `addnode add` using an IP, and `addnode onetry` after with an address that resolved to the same IP\r\n\r\nFor the former, the issue boils down to `CConnman::ThreadOpenAddedConnections` calling `CConnman::GetAddedNodeInfo` once, and iterating over the result to open connections (`CConman::OpenNetworkConnection`) on the same loop for all addresses.`CConnman::ConnectNode` only checks a single address, at random, when resolving from a hostname, and uses it to check whether we are already connected to it.\r\n\r\nAn example to test this would be calling:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"127.0.0.1:port\" add\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"localhost:port\" add\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd check how it allows us to perform both connections some times, and some times it fails.\r\n\r\nThe latter boils down to the same issue, but takes advantage of `onetry` bypassing the `CConnman::ThreadOpenAddedConnections` logic and calling `CConnman::OpenNetworkConnection` straightaway. A way to test this would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"127.0.0.1:port\" add\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"localhost:port\" onetry\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Adding the same peer with two different, yet equivalent, addresses\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of `addnode` is pretty naive when checking what data is added to `m_added_nodes`. Given the collection stores strings, the checks at `CConnman::AddNode()` basically check wether the exact provided string is already in the collection. If so, the data is rejected, otherwise, it is accepted. However, ips can be formatted in several ways that would bypass those checks. \r\n\r\nTwo examples would be `127.0.0.1` being equal to `127.1` and `[::1]` being equal to `[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]`. Adding any pair of these will be allowed by the rpc command, and both will be reported as connected by `getaddednodeinfo`, given they map to the same `CService`. \r\n\r\nThis is less severe than the previous issue, since even tough both nodes are reported as connected by `getaddednodeinfo`, there is only a single connection to them (as properly reported by `getpeerinfo`). However, this adds redundant data to `m_added_nodes`, which is undesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Parametrize `CConnman::GetAddedNodeInfo`\r\nFinally, this PR also parametrizes `CConnman::GetAddedNodeInfo` so it returns either all added nodes info, or only info about the nodes we are **not** connected to. This method is used both for `rpc`, in `getaddednodeinfo`, in which we are reporting all data to the user, so the former applies, and to check what nodes we are not connected to, in `CConnman::ThreadOpenAddedConnections`, in which we are currently returning more data than needed and then actively filtering using `CService.fConnected()`\r\n",
