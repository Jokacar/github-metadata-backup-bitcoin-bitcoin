    "body": "Loading a descriptor wallet currently leads to a segfault if a legacy key type entry is present that can be deserialized successfully and needs SPKman-interaction. To reproduce with a \"cscript\" entry (see second commit for details):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli createwallet crashme\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli unloadwallet crashme\r\n$ sqlite3 ~/.bitcoin/wallets/crashme/wallet.dat\r\nSQLite version 3.38.2 2022-03-26 13:51:10\r\nEnter \".help\" for usage hints.\r\nsqlite> INSERT INTO main VALUES(x'07637363726970740000000000000000000000000000000000000000', x'00');\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli loadwallet crashme\r\n\r\n--- bitcoind output: ---\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z Using SQLite Version 3.38.2\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z Using wallet /home/honey/.bitcoin/wallets/crashme\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z init message: Loading walletâ€¦\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z [crashme] Wallet file version = 10500, last client version = 249900\r\n\r\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBackground: In the wallet key-value-loading routine, most legacy type entries require a `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` instance after successful deserialization. On a descriptor wallet, creating that (via method `GetOrCreateLegacyScriptPubKeyMan`) fails and then leads to a null-pointer dereference crash. E.g. for CSCRIPT: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/50422b770a40f5fa964201d1e99fd6b5dc1653ca/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L589-L594\r\n\r\n\r\n~~This PR fixes this by simply ignoring legacy entries if the wallet flags indicate that we have a descriptor wallet. The second commits adds a regression test to the descriptor wallet's functional test (fortunately Python includes sqlite3 support in the standard library).~~\r\n\r\n~~Probably it would be even better to throw a warning to the user if unexpected legacy entries are found in descriptor wallets, but I think as a first mitigation everything is obvisouly better than crashing. As far as I'm aware, descriptor wallets created/migrated by Bitcoin Core should never end up in a state containing legacy type entries though.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by throwing an error if legacy entries are found in descriptor wallets on loading.",

          "body": "It is useful to have a RPC that can create and add the automatically generated descriptors (that are normally made during creation) to a wallet. This is especially useful when a new default descriptor has been implemented as it allows wallets created before that time to quickly and easily add that type of descriptor.\r\n\r\nIn particular, descriptor wallets created before Taproot was implemented can use the new `createwalletdescriptor` RPC in order to get a Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to keep the newly generated descriptor in line with the existing descriptors, this PR uses #26728 as it exposes a \"wallet extended key\" for us (in addition to upgrading wallets implemented prior to have a wallet xpub). The newly generated descriptors will use the \"wallet extended key\" stored in `CWallet` that PR adds.\r\n\r\n`createwalletdescriptor` is generic and so it can also be used with the other address types. Of course, it given the same wallet extended key, address type, and internal-ness, it will create the same descriptor. So some refactoring has been done in order to detect that the same descriptor is about to be created, and to avoid overwriting any existing descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo be able to use `createwalletdescriptor` with the other address types, we need a way to change the wallet extended key, and so `sethdseed` has been updated and enabled for descriptor wallets. As with legacy wallets, when called without parameters, it will generate a new random master key for the wallet. It can also take a xprv and set that as the master key. It still takes a BIP 32 seed as WIF or as hex as we do for legacy wallets. The seed will be transformed into and stored as a BIP 32 extended key. The latter is to give us greater compatibility with other wallets which often produce non-WIF HD seeds.",

          "body": "Currently when we load a wallet, we just iterate through all of the records in the database and add them completely statelessly. However we have some records which do rely on other records being loaded before they are. To deal with this, we use `CWalletScanState` to hold things temporarily until all of the records have been read and then we load the stateful things.\r\n\r\nHowever this can be slow, and with some future improvements, can cause some pretty drastic slowdowns to retain this pattern. So this PR changes the way we load records by choosing to load the records in a particular order. This lets us do things such as loading a descriptor record, then finding and loading that descriptor's cache and key records. In the future, this will also let us use `IsMine` when loading transactions as then `IsMine` will actually be working as we now always load keys and descriptors before transactions.\r\n\r\nIn order to get records of a specific type, this PR includes some refactors to how we do database cursors. Functionality is also added to retrieve a cursor that will give us records beginning with a specified prefix.\r\n\r\nLastly, one thing that iterating the entire database let us do was to find unknown records. However even if unknown records were found, we would not do anything with this information except output a number in a log line. With this PR, we would no longer be aware of any unknown records. This does not change functionality as we don't do anything with unknown records, and having unknown records is not an error. Now we would just not be aware that unknown records even exist.",

Some sort of db checksum created from one of the wallet encrypted keys might solve tampering attempts in a more general manner. \r\nI'm speaking generally because we most likely have other ways to crash/break the wallet at startup by inserting data directly into the db. Like modifying and/or erasing the wallet flags or the min version field, or changing a spkm type which would crash during the `GetNewDestination` type check assertion.",

          "body": "This PR adds a signature to the encrypted key records (`ckey` and `walletdescriptorckey`) which acts as an additional checksum. The signature is produced by the private key, and signs the encrypted private key data. It is a schnorr signature. The signature is verified when the encrypted key record is loaded, and if it fails to verify then the loading fails with a wallet corrupted error.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of doing this is to mitigate a common scam where users are given/sold a wallet file that contains \"encrypted\" private keys that correspond to several high valued UTXOs. However the \"encrypted\" keys are not actually encrypted, they are just garbage data. The signature allows the wallet to ensure that the private keys for the stated pubkeys was known at the time of encryption, so it should help mitigate this scam by making it harder for scammers to make high value UTXOs appear to be IsMine.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a downgrade attack where the scammer can continue to do this with a wallet that does not have signatures over the encrypted keys. To mitigate this, the user will get a warning when they open a wallet that has encrypted keys without signatures. When the wallet is next unlocked, the signatures will be generated and written to the wallet file.",

An example use case would be private donations.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is not a final version, but to start the discussion and get benchmarks based on a real implementation.\r\n\r\nThis version is built on top of [#994](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/994) (bitcoin-core/secp256k1) for x-only ECDH support and #23480 (bitcoin/bitcoin) for `rawtr()`. Each new silent transaction detected is stored in wallet as a `rawtr()` descriptor. \r\n\r\nIn this implementation, the sender can tweak the recipient address by passing the `silent_payment` option to send RPC. The transaction output will be different from the address entered.\r\n\r\nFor example `./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named send outputs=\"[{\\\"bcrt1pwlh5xuyrpgfunwyww8cfu78yfs2yqyevl7yturavahh5kgxwdd2q5hzgfu\\\": 1.1}]\" fee_rate=1 options=\"{ \\\"silent_payment\\\": true}\"`.\r\n\r\nwill generate `vout` with completely unrelated outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"vout\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 1.10000000,\r\n      \"n\": 0,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(65b19890c5ca40edb816d26f5f48cd9f3ed51121613b1c2405adc1a6dbbc824a)#8myx9tcu\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pvkce3yx9efqwmwqk6fh47jxdnuld2yfpvya3cfq94hq6dkausf9qrfjkgz\",\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 2.02499835,\r\n      \"n\": 1,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(c45cb3d500bbf8f0c8841e8e011b008781d826c16ee348edb822c0f97419bc4d)#26hcce63\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pc3wt84gqh0u0pjyyr68qzxcqs7qasfkpdm353mdcytq0jaqeh3xsuvlykg\",\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny wallet, as long as it has access to private keys, can send silent payments. Thus, this excludes watch-only wallets or wallets with external signers .\r\n\r\nBut the recipient's wallet needs a new flag called `SILENT_PAYMENT`. This flag allows an additional scan that verifies that the wallet keys match the silent payment scheme. When it detects a silent payment that belongs to the wallet, it is stored in a `rawtr()` descriptor.\r\n\r\n`./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named createwallet wallet_name=\"recipient\" silent_payment=true`\r\n\r\nTherefore, scanning each address for each transaction is potentially prohibitive overhead, so the node can be initialized with `keypool=1` or a descriptor with range [0,1] can be imported into a blank wallet. Until there is more benchmark data, it is the safest option. The proposal recommends one static address.\r\n\r\nI've been running some silent payments on signet using wallets with default keypool and default range, I haven't noticed any relevant performance drops on the signet node.\r\nApparently this implementation is working as expected but I can't guarantee that the scheme is implemented correctly or safely, so I'm opening this PR for reviews, modifications and improvements.\r\n\r\nThere is a new functional test (`test/functional/wallet_silentpayment.py`) that can help to better understand the implementation.",

          "body": "Builds on top of #25907 and one commit from #22341.\r\n\r\nFirst this PR introduces a descriptor wallet RPC `addhdseed`. Similar to its legacy wallet counterpart `sethdseed` it either generates a fresh random seed, for use on a blank wallet, or the user can provide a WIF. Unlike `sethdseed` this RPC call does not add keys / fill the keypool.\r\n\r\nThis allows a user to create a blank wallet (`createwallet`), provide it with a seed (`addhdseed`) and then craft custom descriptors. (An alternative approach would to add a `nodescriptors` argument to `createwallet`, but this RPC seems useful anyway)\r\n\r\nAn example use case of this is setting up a multisig between Core and a hardware wallet. After adding the seed to an otherwise empty wallet, the user would call `getxpub m/87'/0'/0'`. They would then combine this `xpub` and origin info with the one from their hardware wallet (e.g. using `hwi --fingerprint .... getxpub m/87'/0'/0'`  and craft a descriptor like `wsh(sorted_multi(2, [...../87'/0'/0']our_xpub, [..../87'/0'/0']their_xpub))`, and import that. The resulting wallet will be able to sign its part of the transaction.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this PR enables to ability descriptors, such as in the multisig example above, in such a way that any `fingerprint` + `xpub` that is covered by our hd seed(s) can be signed for.",
