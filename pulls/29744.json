    "body": "Motivated by a [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29479#pullrequestreview-1957109397) in #29479, this draft PR rewrites the `lint-include-guards.py`, `lint-includes.py`, and `lint-spelling.py` linters in Rust.\r\n\r\nThe only expected change in behavior is that the include guards lint now prints all missing include guards before exiting. \r\n\r\nPart of the motivation for this PR is reusing `fn get_pathspecs_exclude_subtrees`. I can see reasons why the benefits of this PR might be outweighed by the downsides so I'm just publishing this as a draft to explore if further rewriting the lint suite in rust is desirable, and if so, what the best approach is.\r\n",

I don't think there's any practical scenario where this is a problem right now, but there's a lot of potential for weird problems (eg, if a process manages to outlive bitcoind - perhaps it's hanging - the listening port(s) won't get released and starting bitcoind again will fail). It's also a potential security issue if a child process is intended to be sandboxed at some point. Not to mention plain ugly :)\r\n\r\nNote that boost::process has a `boost::process::limit_handles` extension for this, but it requires a newer Boost and is even in the latest version still somewhat broken on Windows (where it probably doesn't matter since handle inheritance is off by default - but will execute undefined behaviour dereferencing/writing of an end-iterator): https://github.com/boostorg/process/issues/200\r\n\r\nInstead of closing directly, we have to set the `FD_CLOEXEC` flag and let `exec` close them; otherwise, boost::process's internal pipe would be closed and we get the wrong exception thrown (not actually a problem outside of our tests, but might as well do this cleanly).",

      "body": "> Previously the linters were separated into their own files and could be called separately as well.\r\n\r\nGood point. This should be trivial to fix. For example by having an environment variable to indicate which check to run. For example `LINT=subtree cargo run` to run `lint_subtree`, and `LINT=help` to print all LINT tests.\r\n\r\n> The `lint_all` function also doesn't actually run all linters anymore with this change, it only runs the python ones\r\n\r\nI don't think this has changed. The linters written in bash were never run as part of \"lint all\", for example `git-subtree-check.sh` or `test/lint/commit-script-check.sh`. Also, `test/lint/check-doc.py` (written in python) was never run as part of \"lint all\".\r\n\r\nGenerally, I think more important than the choice of language is to actually fix the issue that was intended to be solved. That is, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29744#issuecomment-2022534641 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29744#issuecomment-2022606314 . Whether the fix is done in Python or Rust should be secondary, as long as the fix is done.",
