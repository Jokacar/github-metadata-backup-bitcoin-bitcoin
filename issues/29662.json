    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\r\n\r\nI'd like some way to control the levelDB compaction processes a bit more. Specifically, if I could control when they are scheduled (hourly in the background, for example), and possibly limit resources they consume (I/O, in particular), I think it would help.\r\n\r\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\r\n\r\nThe problem I'm having is that when I reboot my bitcoin-core node (which runs with `txindex=1`), the RPC listener comes up pretty promptly, so my healthchecks (currently just TCP) pass. However, the service is not in its usual baseline state; it is doing a lot of read I/O, and logging about levelDB compaction. This condition lasts for about an hour. \r\n\r\nHere is an illustration of the I/O level relative to baseline. The left side is the restart, and the lower right side is after this abates. Dark blue is read:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"634\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/35895831/f0902e3d-a41f-4a45-bbd4-b22c18537fa6\">\r\n\r\nHere's a summary of the logs at this time:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/35895831/4d42e318-5430-45a7-b761-5c16394d76ab\">\r\n\r\nThe \"Compacting\" log line is extremely elevated during this period (though it does occur at a much lower level after):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/35895831/815b361b-b242-4a89-a32a-a7c5c7e66155\">\r\n\r\nHere's a graph of RPC trace P50 duration before, during, and after this phase:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1200\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/35895831/f6c6ca27-6db2-4ef2-937f-d390da18e66d\">\r\n\r\nThe real problem is the last graph, the elevated RPC latency. The tail and head latencies are also much worse than normal, so it's not just a tail latency issue I could solve with timeouts / hedging. The server goes from microsecond/millisecond latency to 10s of seconds, especially for `sendrawtransaction` (10-30s max), with `listunspent` a distant second (3-4s max).\r\n\r\nThis latency abates as soon as the high I/O and compaction logging stops. I am therefore making the **intuitive leap** (so experts, please consider this critically and I welcome other explanations) that resource utilization during compaction is causing some RPCs to be very slow. I also considered lock contention (perhaps `cs_main`) but I couldn't see it in the code.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI'd like the experts to recommend a solution. Intuitively, it seems like levelDB could amortize this compaction work during normal operation as a background task ([the README seems to imply it already should?](https://github.com/google/leveldb?tab=readme-ov-file#read-performance)). Or maybe some way to limit resources used for compaction? \r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm looking at alternative ways to do the RPC I enabled `txindex` for, which is `getrawtransaction` without the blockhash. But, that will only sidestep this issue with compaction and RPC latency.\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\nI am using a slower filesystem than most. It is a regionally-replicated NFS store, which we chose for resiliency reasons. Intuitively, I'd expect this problem to be less severe (or shorter duration) with lower-latency storage, but still present.\r\n\r\nCommand line args: \r\n\r\n```\r\ntxindex=\"1\", rpcworkqueue=\"1024\", rpc_*=\"redacted\", debug=\"coindb\", debug=\"estimatefee\", debug=\"reindex\", debug=\"leveldb\", debug=\"walletdb\", debug=\"lock\", debug=\"rpc\", dbcache=\"5734\", datadir=\"/home/bitcoin/data\", chain=\"main\"\r\n```",

      "body": "Hi @domZippilli.\r\n\r\nWhilst I think having more control over leveldb compaction would be nice, it seems to me that the changes would be pretty invasive to our leveldb subtree, which we don't particularly want to touch.\r\n\r\nI tried some minimal changes, such as skipping the scheduled compaction on startup, however it's clear to me on testing this that these compaction jobs are scheduled very regularly by the DB implementation (and see below), as this made almost no difference to when I observed compaction running. It would also be possible to increase the leveldb cache size to trigger compactions less frequently (in combination with the previous change).\r\n\r\nHaving read the leveldb documentation compaction is run:\r\n\r\n1. when the DB is opened (which I tested changes to)\r\n2. when the log gets full (unavoidable) or \r\n3. when manual compaction is called.\r\n\r\nYou might be able to get some different performance characteristics by changing the database cache size in the source code manually, but I think it's unlikely that these changes/options will see implementation in main branch here.\r\n\r\nIf you are in IBD compactions will be unavoidable as you sync and the cache fills, but it sounds like you are either restarting or recovering from failure?\r\n\r\nThe startup compactions I saw are mostly coming from initial chainstate verifcation -- we verify the first 6 blocks at startup which triggers a few of these. Without disabling this (highly not recommended) I don't see any way to avoid them either. Disabling these check did see fewer startup compactions. You could probably therefore see improved performance by setting `-checkblocks=1`, which would be preferable to the below (crude, untested, don't run these!) changes which skips block checks altogether.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>diff</summary>\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/init.cpp b/src/init.cpp\r\nindex 1a4fce4678..f55aadc9de 100644\r\n--- a/src/init.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/init.cpp\r\n@@ -614,6 +614,7 @@ void SetupServerArgs(ArgsManager& argsman)\r\n     argsman.AddArg(\"-checkblocks=<n>\", strprintf(\"How many blocks to check at startup (default: %u, 0 = all)\", DEFAULT_CHECKBLOCKS), ArgsManager::ALLOW_ANY | ArgsManager::DEBUG_ONLY, OptionsCategory::DEBUG_TEST);\r\n     argsman.AddArg(\"-checklevel=<n>\", strprintf(\"How thorough the block verification of -checkblocks is: %s (0-4, default: %u)\", Join(CHECKLEVEL_DOC, \", \"), DEFAULT_CHECKLEVEL), ArgsManager::ALLOW_ANY | ArgsManager::DEBUG_ONLY, OptionsCategory::DEBUG_TEST);\r\n     argsman.AddArg(\"-checkblockindex\", strprintf(\"Do a consistency check for the block tree, chainstate, and other validation data structures occasionally.
