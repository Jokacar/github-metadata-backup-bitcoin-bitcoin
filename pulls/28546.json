    "body": "Originally, this PR fixed a wallet migration bug that could cause the watchonly wallet created by legacy wallet migration to have incorrect transaction height values. A different fix for the bug was implemented in #28609, but that PR did not add any test coverage that would have caught the bug, and didn't include other changes from this PR intended to prevent problems from invalid transaction heights.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new asserts to catch invalid transaction heights, which would trigger test failures without bugfix in #28609. This PR also refactors code and adds comments to clarify assumptions and make it less likely a bug from invalid transaction height values would be introduced.",

Would be happy to review a PR if you have an idea of how to implement that. (Feel free to take any changes from this PR if they'd be useful. Or we could fix the bug directly with this PR and then make the change the loading in a later PR.)",

Also dropped commit cdd66441a0dddefe566da480a7015dbae299b4bb which is no longer neccessary after #28609.\r\n\r\nAlso updated title and PR description since the original bug was fixed #28609, and now this PR is just adding asserts and cleanup to prevent related bugs. Original description was:\r\n\r\n>**bugfix: watchonly wallets created after migration have incorrect height values**\r\n>\r\n>During migration, `CWalletTx` objects that no longer belong to the migrated wallet are moved to a watchonly wallet. But because the migrated wallet is offline (has null `m_chain`), the `confirmed_block_height` and `conflicting_block_height` values in these transactions are -1. These values need to be updated before they are moved to the watchonly wallet, because the watchonly wallet is online, and remains loaded after the migration is complete. Not updating these values could lead to the watchonly wallet returning incorrect information and potentially triggering assert failures.\r\n>\r\n>The problem is only temporary since the height values would be refreshed the next time the watchonly wallet is loaded, but it is worth fixing to avoid unpredictable behavior.\r\n>\r\n>Noticed while reviewing #28542, and looking for other cases where negative confirmed_block_height and conflicting_block_height values might be used.\r\n>\r\n>An easy way to test this bug is to revert the bugfix in the second commit. Then the assert added in the third commit will trigger a crash when `getwalletinfo` is called in [`wallet_migration.py`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c9f288244b8d183e09a917025922b99e3368ef78/test/functional/wallet_migration.py#L250)",

      "body": "> Wouldn't be clearer to move the non-serialized members to optional?\r\n> \r\n> But other than that, what make some noise on me about the approach is that we would be \"hiding\" a `cs_main` locking cause. Because `chain.findBlock()` locks the mutex internally. Which, I know that it is currently not really important, but maybe in the future we would like to batch calls that lock `cs_main` as much as possible in the wallet.\r\n\r\nVery much agree it makes sense to make locking and lookups explicit, and this change helps that, doesn't hurt it. It moves lookups to a function that explicitly is meant to do lookups, and explicitly takes a Chain parameter and doesn't have access to other wallet state. (CWalletTx used to have a CWallet* backpointer, but this was removed in b11a195ef450bd138aa03204a5e74fdd3ddced26 to force this explicitness.) The current block lookup code before this PR is in the middle of a `CWallet::LoadToWallet` function which is messier and is able to do the lookup because it has full access to the monolithic CWallet class.\r\n\r\nTaking your batching example, if you wanted to look up the block heights as a batch, instead of between loading each transaction, this change gets closer to that goal, because it moves the lookup code out of the per-transaction LoadToWallet to function to a separate function exactly like you would do if you were making that change.\r\n\r\nOn your first idea of making heights use std::optional instead of -1 when they are uninitialized, that would be a fine change but it would not make code more explicit or improve code organization, so I see it as being more shallow. It would be complementary though.",

I would rather keep that file exclusively for primitive data.\r\nThis way, we can avoid providing access to the chain interface class (or to its declaration) in places that shouldn't have access to it, such as the `walletdb.cpp` loading process. The function wouldn't be member of `CWalletTx`; It would probably take the chain + a vector of wtx references for updating.\r\n\r\nedit:\r\nstill.. thinking it further, `walletdb.cpp` will continue having access to the chain interface class because it includes `wallet.h`..\r\nso, cross that point out.",
