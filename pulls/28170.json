Allowing the node\r\nto recover from the following post-IBD scenario:\r\nSuppose the node has successfully synced the chain, but later experienced\r\ndropped connections and remained inactive for a duration longer than the limited\r\npeers threshold (the timeframe within which limited peers can provide blocks). In\r\nsuch cases, upon reconnecting to the network, the node might only establish\r\nconnections with limited peers, filling up all available outbound slots. Resulting\r\nin an inability to synchronize the chain (because limited peers will not provide\r\nblocks older than the `NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED_MIN_BLOCKS` threshold).",

          "body": "To improve privacy, relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for relaying sensitive data (our own transactions) with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local unbroadcast transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer and the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed\r\n\r\n* Relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers.\r\n\r\n* Hide those transactions from `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` requests, as if we don't have them.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, request the transaction with `GETDATA`, as if we didn't have it before.\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the unbroadcast list.\r\n\r\n* `INV` it to others as a result of the `TX` message we get, like what we do with transactions that are not ours.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new local transaction is received (from the wallet or RPC), the node will send it to 5 (`SENSITIVE_RELAY_NUM_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 5 more peers (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptInitialBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived sensitive relay connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers will blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [x] Disable if `-connect` is used or Tor and I2P are not reachable.\r\n* [x] Use I2P transient connections even if listening on I2P.\r\n* [x] Do something with the user-agent string (could reveal identity if it has been personalized) and make sure no identifying information in the `VERSION` message. Done: took the [suggestion below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#issuecomment-1517896418).\r\n* [x] Improve the condition when we consider the transaction seen by the network: right now a single INV from somebody suffices (this is still an improvement over `master` which is ok right after pushing the tx to a peer). We could wait for more than one INV, from peers that we have selected (outbound) and that are specifically not the ones we broadcasted to (via short-lived connection). Edit: One `INV` should be enough because after that we broadcast the transaction to everybody we are connected to (like if it is not ours).\r\n* [ ] Idea: start with one connection per transaction (not 5 as it is now), optimistically assuming it will be sufficient. (numbers are examples) After 1 minute, if still not received from the network, try 2 connections, after a few minutes try more. If still unsuccessful after 10 minutes, then fall back to the old mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to address:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450\r\n",

This is not completely true for the inbound eviction logic as it exists as static functions in `net.{h.cpp}` for which tests already exist. However, the outbound eviction logic is not covered by any fuzz tests and is only testable by spinning up both a connman and peerman.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits out the eviction logic into its own component `EvictionManager`. In addition to isolating the eviction logic, we get rid of several layer violations (e.g. `CConnman::ForEachNode/ForNode` calls, `CNode::m_last_block_time`, etc.) between `net` and `net processing`.\r\n\r\nOne instance of the `EvictionManager` is created at start up and passed as a reference to the connection and peer managers. The connection and peer managers report all eviction relevant information to the eviction manager who ultimately suggests nodes to evict as the result of `EvictionManager::SelectInboundNodeToEvict` and `EvictionManager::SelectOutboundNodesToEvict`.",

We consider ourselves in IBD if our tip is older than 24hs (or the custom max tip age) and we haven't completed IBD yet. Once IBD is completed, the node remains out of IBD for the entire software lifecycle.\r\n\r\n> > Suppose the node has successfully synced the chain, but later experienced\r\n> > dropped connections and remained inactive for a duration longer than the limited\r\n> > peers threshold (the timeframe within which limited peers can provide blocks).

The IBD flag is set to true but never reverted for the entire software lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThe scenario that I described in the PR description is a real scenario. Reproducible by running #28120 test case. Which exercises the proposed behavior.\r\n\r\nBasically, same as the IBD flag, `g_initial_block_download_completed` is set to true but never reverted. Which ends up with the node always connecting to limited peers after the first IBD completion. Not accounting for prolonged stalling situations, where the node is beyond the limited peers threshold due an internet outage.\r\n\r\nTo test the behavior, you could drop the bug fix commit from that branch. Will see the post-IBD super stalled node connecting to a limited peer even when such peer is not helpful, as it will not provide any of the historical blocks required to sync-up the node.",

See #27463 for full project tracking.\r\n\r\nPlease see #27742 for how this PR fits into the big picture. I strongly suggest that reviewers look at that PR first to decide if they are comfortable with the overall approach.\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly refactors, with a few behavior changes and improvements:\r\n- Introduces `TxDownloadManager`, which handles all transaction downloading. It contains the `TxRequestTracker`, `TxOrphanage`, and filters for `AlreadyHaveTx`.\r\n- Updates logs for tx {validation, relay, orphans} to include both txid and wtxid when possible.\r\n- Adds a new log category, `TXPACKAGES`. Logging in the orphanage is changed from `MEMPOOL` to `TXPACKAGES`.\r\n- Adds support for tracking when multiple peers provided the same tx in the orphanage.\r\n- Makes `TxDownloadManager` responsible for tracking the orphans we need to resolve and deciding how/when to resolve them.\r\n- Adds all announcers of an orphan as potential resolution candidates. This tracker is a `TxDownloadManager` which helps us schedule requests.\r\n   - In this PR, \"orphan resolution\" means requesting missing parents by `getdata(MSG_TX | MSG_WITNESS_FLAG, missing_txid)`.\r\n    - In a future PR, we'll add another resolution method, requesting ancestor wtxids using `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO, orphan_wtxid)`.",

          "body": "This PR adds `last_block_announcement` to the per-peer `getpeerinfo` RPC result. This is the most recent time that this peer was the first to notify our node of a new block (one that we didn't already know about), or zero if this peer has never been the first to notify us of a new block. This timestamp already exists internally and is used for stale-tip eviction logic; this PR exposes it at the RPC layer.\r\n\r\nThis PR started out as a suggestion for additional test coverage, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26172#issuecomment-1259678260. It turned out that the easiest way to test (already-merged) #26172 is to add this field to `getpeerinfo` and have a functional test verify its value. But it may also be useful to have this result in its own right, similar to that RPC's existing `last_block` field -- it indicates something about the quality of our peers. It allows one to predict which peer will be evicted when the stale tip logic activates. (I'm not sure if that would be useful, but it may be.)\r\n\r\nThe functional test added here fails without #26172, which is the main goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not test the actual stale-tip eviction logic; that's difficult to do with a functional test. But it does test the correctness of the timestamp that the eviction logic depends on. #23352 is an attempt to test the eviction logic using a unit test, it's not ready to be merged yet. I think having both kinds of tests would be beneficial.",

          "body": "`LookupSubNet()` would treat addresses that start with `fc` as IPv6 even if `-cjdnsreachable` is set. This creates the following problems where it is called:\r\n\r\n* `NetWhitelistPermissions::TryParse()`: otherwise `-whitelist=` fails to white list CJDNS addresses: when a CJDNS peer connects to us, it will be matched against IPv6 `fc...` subnet and the match will never succeed.\r\n\r\n* `BanMapFromJson()`: CJDNS bans are stored as just IPv6 addresses in `banlist.json`. Upon reading from disk they have to be converted back to CJDNS, otherwise, after restart, a ban entry like (`fc00::1`, IPv6) would not match a peer (`fc00::1`, CJDNS).\r\n    \r\n* `RPCConsole::unbanSelectedNode()`: in the GUI the ban entries go through `CSubNet::ToString()` and back via `LookupSubNet()`. Then it must match whatever is stored in `BanMan`, otherwise it is impossible to unban via the GUI.\r\n\r\nThese were uncovered by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26859.\r\n\r\nThus, flip the result of `LookupSubNet()` to CJDNS if the network base address starts with `fc` and `-cjdnsreachable` is set. Since subnetting/masking does not make sense for CJDNS (the address is \"random\" bytes, like Tor and I2P, there is no hierarchy) treat `fc.../mask` as an invalid `CSubNet`.\r\n\r\nTo achieve that, `MaybeFlipIPv6toCJDNS()` has to be moved from `net` to `netbase` and thus also `IsReachable()`. In the process of moving `IsReachable()`, `SetReachable()` and `vfLimited[]` encapsulate those in a class.",

And this field is strictly linked to the node's overall status. Right now, `HasDesirableServiceFlags()` requires to know the chain sync status.\r\nSo, by placing it inside `CConMan`, we add another level of indirection. Because, most of the time, the peer manager class will call to the `CConMan` setter and subsequently call the getter to utilize it. Using the `CConMan` class mostly as a field container.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would complicate any expansion of the peer services selectivity logic because different processes would require to update the flag stored in `CConMan`. For instance, the node could be seeking to exclusively connect to peers that provide block filters (up to a certain point, then pick other preferences on a case basis), or could want to minimize the number of limited connections based on the chain download state, or if a chain stale state was detected, or could be needing to disallow certain peer types for a certain time etc.\r\n\r\nConsidering this, the responsibility for managing this field seems to fit better inside the peer manager class.\r\n\r\nHappy to hear your thoughts about this. Will keep thinking about it, we can still improve this to not require `cs_main` lock even when it's placed inside the peers manager class.",

The main container for the flags would still be peerman.\r\n\r\nOk. What I dislike about that approach is that we lose a lot of flexibility.\r\n\r\nThe PeerManager should be able to decide granularly whether to connect to a specific address before ConnMann opens the connection and initiates handshaking etc.\r\nThe node's contextual information and logic required to take the decision of opening a socket to a particular address resides mostly in PeerManager (right now, we only have the stale chain condition, but there could be more). And, by adding another field inside ConnMan, we would be duplicating data (same `desirable_services` field inside PeerManager and ConnMan), which would need to be synchronized and could potentially lead to race conditions.\r\n\r\nI mean, this misalignment could result in ConnMan performing actions that are no longer in line with the latest PeerManager state. For instance, it might create connections to multiple peers with certain service flags, when PeerManager only intended to connect to one peer supporting such service flags. This situation would eventually lead to PeerManager closing the newly created connections when it sends the version message, as these connections are no longer desirable. Which is a waste of resources.\r\n\r\nThus why I think that the callback mechanism suits well here. So PeerManager is able to evaluate each connection request, and avoid executing the connection + handshake when we are going to disconnect the peer anyway.",

      "body": "> Why stop doing extra block-relay peers in this situation?\r\n\r\nBecause, in the stalling scenario, we not only need to progress at the chain level, we might also need to receive new addresses from the network. And block-relay-only connections are limited in that sense. The node rejects addresses coming from them.\r\n\r\n> If for whatever reason our current peers aren't able to send us the blocks to get us out of this situation, maybe trying an additional one will.\r\n\r\nThats basically what we currently do. The stalling behavior triggers the \"try new outbound connection\" functionality. Which instructs ConnMan to create a new full relay connection even when the outbound slots are full.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nWith this, I'm not disagreeing about keeping the extra-block-relay connections enabled. Just thought that they might not be as useful, given that we're already performing the same actions with the \"try new outbound connection\" functionality.",
