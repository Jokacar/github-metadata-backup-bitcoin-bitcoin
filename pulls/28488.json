      "body": "I don't think it's as simple as disconnecting from peers with a minfee filter X% larger than ours. A minfee filter X% larger doesn't mean the peer's mempool is X% smaller. Take a simple extreme example: our mempool is filled with 299MB of >10sats/vb txs, and 1MB of 1sats/vb transaction. Out peer sets `-maxmempool=299`. It advertizes a minfee filter >=10sats/vb. That's at least 10 times ours, but we really shouldn't disconnect it.\r\n\r\nWhat i was thinking about with my suggestion in #28371 was to get a conservative maximum size of the peer's mempool based on their advertized minfee filter and our own mempool. And disconnect it if it's unreasonably small. (Like 80% smaller than our own `-maxmempool`.)",

Or, even could be employed in\r\nspecial procedures like a prune node rescan that uses BIP158 block filters,\r\nor even into BIP157 itself.",

      "body": "@darosior `m_total_fee / totalTxSize` (instead of GetMinFee()) would kinda solve the example you point out, but it's not perfect either. I agree that what you suggest is ideal. I just haven't found a way to apply other peer's minfeerate to our mempool in a reasonable way.\r\nMaybe this:\r\n\r\nEvery time we consider evicting (say every hour), traverse through our mempool and apply the peer's minfeerate, then see how many transactions are dropped. (A slightly optimized way would be to use a binary search to find at what exact feerate we're at 80% of mempool size — that would be faster, and also will better apply across peers).\r\n\r\nIs that roughly what you're thinking about?",

If you assume an attacker can easily take `new outbound slots`, then our peers might belong to an attacker in the first place... Outbound peer eviction should not be too cheap (say, an attacker should not be able to roll a hundred of peers in a day), but for that I think algorithm can be tuned.\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure I understand your precise attack scenario. Let's say mempools are equal-size and half empty. What it will take for your attack to force at least one eviction? In fees and capital locked, I guess (dropping the spying effort for now).\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n>I don’t know if a better direction would be to announce the local maxmempool at p2p connection, sounds this is less prone to manipulation by external peers flowing high-feerate transactions in a targeted fashion.\r\n\r\nDoesn't it have a similar risk?
