It also improves indexing sync logic, which is moved out of indexing code to a new [`node::SyncChain()`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/8d8cdcb37005030f646ba3c45f7f54f556efb8bf/src/node/chain.h#L24-L39) function.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the commits in this PR are small refactoring changes that move code from `src/index/` to `src/node/`, or replace references to node types like `CBlockIndex`, `CChain`, `CChainState` in index code. There are only two commits affecting indexing sync logic which make complicated or substantive changes:\r\n\r\n- [`da6dc24e3c4f` indexes: Rewrite chain sync logic, remove racy init](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24230/commits/da6dc24e3c4fd8f99d869acc085384e8b2f32c8e)\r\n- [`d4a2320a77e1` indexes: Initialize indexes without holding cs_main](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24230/commits/d4a2320a77e1a25f89b53dbdda40551959c174c2)\r\n\r\nThe commit messages have more details about these and other changes. Followups to this PR will reuse indexing sync code for wallets (#15719, #11756) and let indexes run in separate processes (#10102)",

However, the IBD criteria -- an optimization mostly targeted at behavior when we have peers serving us many blocks we need to download -- is difficult to reason about in edge-case scenarios, such as if the network were to go a long time without any blocks found and nodes are getting restarted during that time.\r\n\r\nTo make things simpler to reason about, just use `nMinimumChainWork` as our anti-DoS threshold for responding to a getheaders request; as long as our chain has that much work, it should be fine to respond to a peer asking for our headers (and this should allow such a peer to request blocks from us if needed).",

They were introduced in #15759.\r\n\r\nWhen creating an outbound block-relay-only connection, since we know that we're never going to announce transactions over that connection, we can save on memory usage by not a `TxRelay` data structure for that connection. When receiving an inbound connection, we don't know whether the connection was opened by the peer as block-relay-only or not, and therefore we always construct a `TxRelay` data structure for inbound connections.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible to tell whether an inbound connection will ever request that we start announcing transactions to it. The `fRelay` field in the `version` message may be set to `0` to indicate that the peer does not wish to receive transaction announcements. The peer may later request that we start announcing transactions to it by sending a `filterload` or `filterclear` message, **but only if we have offered `NODE_BLOOM` services to that peer**. `NODE_BLOOM` services are disabled by default, and it has been recommended for some time that users not enable `NODE_BLOOM` services on public connections, for privacy and anti-DoS reasons.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we have not offered `NODE_BLOOM` to the peer _and_ it has set `fRelay` to `0`, then we know that it will never request transaction announcements, and that we can save resources by not initializing the `TxRelay` data structure.",

          "body": "Compact blocks are used for efficient relay of blocks, either through High Bandwidth or Low Bandwidth mode. See [BIP 152](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki) for full details.\r\n\r\nFor compact block relay to work, the receiver must have a mempool containing transactions which are likely to be included in the block. The receiver uses these transactions to reconstruct the block from the short transaction ids included in the `cmpctblock` message. Compact blocks are therefore only useful for relaying blocks at or near the tip of the block chain. For older blocks, the recipient won't have the transactions in their mempool and so would need to request them using a `getblocktxn` message. In such cases, just requesting the full block is more efficient.\r\n\r\nBIP 152 supports two versions: version 1 (without witnesses) and version 2 (with witnesses). Version 2 is required to reconstruct segwit blocks. Segwit was activated in August 2017, and providing non-witness blocks to peers is no longer useful. Since the witnesses are not included, the peer would not be able to fully validate all the consensus rules on the provided block.\r\n\r\nTherefore, stop supporting version 1 compact blocks. Ignore `sendcmpct` messages with version=1, and don't advertise support by sending `sendcmpct` with version=1. Only send `sendcmpct` to peers with `NODE_WITNESS`. Respond to all requests for compact blocks or blocktxns with witness-serialized blocks and transactions.",

This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Original change description\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with assumeutxo, here's a brief summary from [the issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15605) (where any conceptual discussion not specific to this implementation should happen):\r\n\r\n> assumeutxo would be a way to initialize a node using a headers chain and a serialized version of the UTXO state which was generated from another node at some block height. A client making use of this UTXO \"snapshot\" would specify a hash and expect the content of the resulting UTXO set to yield this hash after deserialization. \r\n> \r\n> This would allow users to bootstrap a usable pruned node & wallet far more quickly (and with less disk usage) than waiting for a full initial block download to complete, since we only have to sync blocks between the base of the snapshot and the current network tip. Needless to say this is at expense of accepting a different trust model, though how different this really ends up being from `assumevalid` in effect is worth debate.\r\n\r\nIn short, this is an interesting change because it would allow nodes to get up and running within minutes given a ~3GB file (at time of writing) under an almost identical trust model to assumevalid.\r\n\r\nIn this implementation, I add a few RPC commands: `dumptxoutset` creates a UTXO snapshot and writes it to disk, and `loadtxoutset` intakes a snapshot from disk, constructs and activates chainstate based on it, and continues a from-scratch initial block download in the background for the sole purpose of validating the snapshot. Once the snapshot is validated, we throw away the chainstate used for background validation.\r\n\r\nThe assumeutxo procedure as implemented is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A UTXO snapshot is loaded with the `loadtxoutset <path>` RPC command.\r\n1. A new chainstate (`CChainState`) is initialized using `ChainstateManager::ActivateSnapshot()`:\r\n   1. The serialized UTXO data is read in and various sanity checks are performed, e.g. compare expected coin count, recompute the hash and compare it with assumeutxo hash in source code.\r\n   1. We \"fast forward\" `new_chainstate->m_chain` to have a tip at the base of the snapshot (with or without block data). Lacking block data, we fake the `nTx` counts of the constituent `CBlockIndex` entries.\r\n   1. `LoadChainTip()` is called on the new snapshot and it is installed as our active chainstate.\r\n1. The new assumed-valid chainstate is now our active, and so that enters IBD until it is synced to the network's tip. Presumably the snapshot would be taken relatively close to the current tip but far enough away to avoid meaningful reorgs, say 10,000 blocks deep.\r\n1. Once the active chainstate is out of IBD, our old validation chain continues IBD \"in the background\" while the active chainstate services requests from most of the system.\r\n1. Once the background validation chainstate reaches a height equal the base of the snapshot, we take the hash of its UTXO set and ensure it equals the expected hash based on the snapshot. If the hashes are equivalent, we delete the validation chainstate and move on without event; if they aren't, we log loudly and fall back to the validation chainstate (we should probably just shut down).\r\n\r\nThe implicit assumption is that the background validation chain will always be a subset of the assumed-valid snapshot chain while the latter is active. We don't properly handle reorgs that go deeper than the base of the snapshot.\r\n\r\n### Changes (already merged/outdated)\r\n\r\n![chainstate-beforeafter (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/54435797-a16b0780-4707-11e9-89c3-c90b5686804d.png)\r\n \r\nThe crux of this change is in removing any assumptions in the codebase that there is a single chainstate, i.e. any references to global variables `chainActive`, `pcoinsTip`, et al. need to be replaced with functions that return the relevant chainstate data at that moment in time. This change also takes `CChainState` to its logical conclusion by making it more self-contained - any references to globals like `chainActive` are removed with class-local references (`m_chain`).\r\n\r\nA few minor notes on the implementation:\r\n\r\n- When we attempt to load a wallet with a BestBlock locator lower than the base of a snapshot and the snapshot has not yet been validated, we refuse to load the wallet.\r\n\r\n- For additional notes, see [the new assumeutxo docs](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/blob/utxo-dumpload-compressed/doc/assumeutxo.md).",

The need for this manual reset (AFAICT) arises out of the fact that many of these globals are closely related to the block index (hence `::UnloadBlockIndex`), and need to be reset with it.\r\n\r\nI've shot this \"manual reset\" gun at my foot several times while doing the de-globalize chainman work.\r\n\r\nThankfully, now that we have a `BlockManager` class that owns the block index, these globals should be moved under that class so that they can live and die with the block index. These moves, along with making the block index non-heap-based, eliminates:\r\n1. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3585b521392c5b2c855c3ba6dc9b7d2a171b3710 The need to reason about when we need to manually call `::UnloadBlockIndex` (this decision can at times seem almost arbitrary)\r\n2. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f741623c25455c20bff9eb1ddd10a4ac84dc5655 The need to have an `::UnloadBlockIndex` or explicit `~ChainstateManager` at all",
