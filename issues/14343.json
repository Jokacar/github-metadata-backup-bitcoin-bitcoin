    "body": "Our unit tests and functional tests are non-deterministic in the overall execution, but the coverage should not be affected by that. I.e. some functions might be executed in a different order or sometimes skipped, but every line, function and branch should be executed at least once.\r\n\r\nThis is currently not true, even for serialization errors that should be hit exactly once.\r\n\r\nBeside the obvious issue of missing test coverage on some runs, this also makes it impossible to see how test coverage changes between two commits.",

As a first issue for me, I'd like to start with writing tests and, naturally, I'd like to focus on code for which they're really needed - on the most critical code that lacks coverage. Is there perhaps available a list of source files (or higher granularity units of code, e.g. classes, functions) lacking coverage and sorted by how critical it is to have it?\r\n\r\nOf course, being more familiar with the code base would answer my question, but in order to be more familiar, I feel like I need to write tests for existing code, so it's the chicken and the egg...\r\n\r\nAlso, as something that I believe could contribute to increasing the coverage, what do you think of making the lcov results accessible online and have it updated on every build of the master branch? That can be later tweaked to display the code that lack coverage sorted by priority, so that striving contributors could have a meaningful starting point.",

          "body": "This is an improvement to a test, inspired by #14343 - removing non determinism from a test.\r\n\r\nThe test `descriptor_test` is non-deterministic, as it relies on the `MaybeUseHInsteadOfApostrophy` function which randomly either swaps all apostrophes with 'h' or doesn't at all in a descriptor. This fix makes both cases always run, if an apostrophe is found in a test descriptor.\r\nThis does not reduce test coverage but removes the non-determinism.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `MaybeUseHInsteadOfApostrophy` function removed the checksum if found at the end of a descriptor when the apostrophes are swapped by 'h's, since after being swapped the checksum is no longer correct. I instead added re-calculation of the checksum using the `DescriptorChecksum` function, which adds coverage for the case of a descriptors having 'h's instead of apostrophes and a checksum. This was previously lacking.\r\nTo achieve this I had to move `DescriptorChecksum` and `PolyMod` out of the anonymous namespace in descriptor.cpp to make `DescriptorChecksum` accessible in descriptor_tests.cpp.\r\n\r\nAll tests complete successfully (functional as well as unit tests).",
