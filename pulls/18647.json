    "body": "This PR removes the global **g_rpc_node** and **g_rpc_chain** pointers from RPC functions and other sources & headers. Instead, a NodeContext const reference, and in some cases a NodeContext pointer, is being forwarded to respective actor callbacks.\r\n\r\nAlso, this way we avoid changing the **JSONRPCRequest** that, imo, should remain a plain *message transfer object* without any knowledge about its environment. I consider the idea of having a **void pointer** member of **JSONRPCRequest** problematic because it defeats the compiler type checking. In a way, a globally available, but at least *typed*, pointer would still be better than a *void* pointer, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nPreviously, an RPC function signature looked like this:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstatic UniValue getpeerinfo(const JSONRPCRequest& request)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR changes it to this:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstatic UniValue getpeerinfo(const JSONRPCRequest& request, const NodeContext& node)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, a function that previously used **g_rpc_node** like this: \r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nif(!g_rpc_node->connman)\r\n   throw JSONRPCError(RPC_CLIENT_P2P_DISABLED...[snip]...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould get the same object this way:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nif (!node.connman)\r\n                throw JSONRPCError(RPC_CLIENT_P2P_DISABLED,...[snip]...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same applies to former **g_rpc_chain** where functions like *loadwallet* don't need it anymore:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nLoadWallet(*node.chain, location, error, warning);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis all is made possible by taking the NodeContext into the tableRPC object at init:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n/* Register RPC commands regardless of -server setting so they will be\r\n     * available in the GUI RPC console even if external calls are disabled.\r\n     */\r\n    RegisterAllCoreRPCCommands(tableRPC);\r\n    for (const auto& client : node.chain_clients) {\r\n        client->registerRpcs();\r\n    }\r\n    tableRPC.addNodeContext(&node);    <=== RPC's are available, now take NodeContext to forward it later to them.\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach time an RPC is being called, *tableRPC* will forward the *NodeContext* argument:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstatic bool ExecuteCommand(const CRPCCommand& command, const JSONRPCRequest& request, UniValue& result, bool last_handler, const NodeContext& node)\r\n{\r\n    try\r\n    {\r\n        RPCCommandExecution execution(request.strMethod);\r\n        // Execute, convert arguments to array if necessary\r\n        if (request.params.isObject()) {\r\n            return command.actor(transformNamedArguments(request, command.argNames), result, last_handler, node);\r\n        } else {\r\n            return command.actor(request, result, last_handler, node);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17548  ",

Maybe that is temporary (you could mark this PR a draft), but otherwise title is kind of misleading.\r\n\r\nI never wanted to get rid of it, only make it: \r\n\r\n* **const ref**\r\n* forwarded to actors directly and in one place (and not scattered around as it currently is)\r\n* while keeping **JSONRPCRequest** structure as it is. Why should JSONRPCRequest know anything about NodeContext? I see no reason to let a passive object (a request) that's going back and forth knowing anything about its environment. But maybe there are other things I know nothing about that would mandate such behavior.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, there are still a few places where we still need *g_rpc_node*, but those aren't directly related to this PR, so I deliberately didn't change them. \r\n\r\n**--EDIT**: *My sentence \"never wanted to get rid of it\" might have been misleading. Actually, I want to get rid of it as a global, but wanted to keep the NodeContext itself available to all RPC methods by forwarding it to Actors, of course.*\r\n\r\n**--EDIT 2**: Now the **g_rpc_node** is completely gone.\r\n\r\n> * `NodeContext& rpc_node` arguments should be renamed `NodeContext& node`, RPC prefix is misleading and not doing anything\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n**--EDIT**: Was changed and force-pushed.\r\n\r\n> * `NodeContext* pnode_ctx` followed by `CHECK_NONFATAL(pnode_ctx)` should probably be `NodeContext& node` and not using a pointer. Also current coding convention doesn't prefix pointers variable with p.\r\n\r\nOk. Will check it again.\r\n\r\n**--EDIT**: *Have checked it. Sadly, not possible because copy assignment operator of NodeContext is implicitly deleted. So, will keep it a pointer there, and the check, unless someone comes with a better idea. Any inputs that help me get rid of raw pointers are highly welcome :)*\r\n\r\n> * Wallet RPC methods shouldn't have access to NodeContext. \r\n\r\nI didn't know about his. I thought it's the right place to put the context in, because those methods are being executed *within* a NodeContext. It's like \"self\" variable in python, for example. It's simply there, be it used or not, because at no point in time is an RPC method being used outside NodeContext. But I might be mistaken.\r\n\r\n> At some point we should have WalletContext struct that will hold things like vpwallets and let us get rid of wallet globals, and it would make sense for wallet RPC methods to have access to this. That is why suggestion from #17548 was to just add a new member to JSONRPCRequest that could hold a generic context, not something tied to the wallet or node. Other advantage of using JSONRPCRequest is that you dont' have to change RPC method signatures.\r\n\r\nAgain, why should a passive object, like a request, know anything about the environment that's using it? Why not create some kind of *MetaContext* that holds both Node- and WalletContext and forwards it directly to actors? This way one could easily extend contexts, if there might be a need to do so in future (*I'm only speculating here*)\r\n\r\n**--EDIT**: Another option would be to create a MetaContext that's based on aliasing shared_ptr. Something like this: \r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstruct MetaContext {\r\n    NodeContext node;\r\n    WalletContext wallet;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe then initialize the meta-context first:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nauto meta_ctx = std::shared_ptr<MetaContext>(new MetaContext());\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, when we want to forward the \"correct\" context to a particular actor, we would do this:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nauto subctx_node = std::shared_ptr<NodeContext>(meta_ctx, &meta_ctx->node);  \r\n```\r\n\r\nFor functions that should only deal with Wallet, we then go this way:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nauto subctx_wallet = std::shared_ptr<WalletContext>(meta_ctx, &meta_ctx->wallet);  \r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this strategy we could put any number of different contexts in the same place, but only reveal those that are of use to functions which will consume them.\r\n\r\n> * This appears to be adding `NodeContext&` parameters to many RPC methods that don't use it. Again this may be another reason to just make it accessible through JSONRPCRequest\r\n\r\nI see it like the \"self\" or \"this\" pointers. They're always there, regardless of usage. \"Some\" context is always there.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks again!\r\n",

In particular, instead of having `bumpfee` give out a psbt when there are no private keys, add a `psbtbumpfee` RPC that always gives out a psbt and just have `bumpfee` be disabled when there are no private keys. This is mirrored in the GUI bumpfee menu items. Additionally, instead of changing the `Send` button to `Create Unsigned` when there are no private keys, just always have a `Create Unsigned` button and disable `Send` when there are no private keys. To deal with `bumpfee` already doing the mutated behavior thing, that behavior is hidden behind a `-deprecatedrpc=bumpfee` option.\r\n\r\nTo make the GUI stuff easier to follow, test, and review, this is being based on #17509",

          "title": "Native Descriptor Wallets using DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan",
          "body": "Introducing the wallet of the glorious future (again): native descriptor wallets. With native descriptor wallets, addresses are generated from descriptors. Instead of generating keys and deriving addresses from keys, addresses come from the scriptPubKeys produced by a descriptor. Native descriptor wallets will be optional for now and can only be created by using `createwallet`.\r\n\r\nDescriptor wallets will store descriptors, master keys from the descriptor, and descriptor cache entries. Keys are derived from descriptors on the fly. In order to allow choosing different address types, 6 descriptors are needed for normal use. There is a pair of primary and change descriptors for each of the 3 address types. With the default keypool size of 1000, each descriptor has 1000 scriptPubKeys and descriptor cache entries pregenerated. This has a side effect of making wallets large since 6000 pubkeys are written to the wallet by default, instead of the current 2000. scriptPubKeys are kept only in memory and are generated every time a descriptor is loaded. By default, we use the standard BIP 44, 49, 84 derivation paths with an external and internal derivation chain for each.\r\n\r\nDescriptors can also be imported with a new `importdescriptors` RPC.\r\n\r\nNative descriptor wallets use the `ScriptPubKeyMan` interface introduced in #16341 to add a `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan`. This defines a different IsMine which uses the simpler model of \"does this scriptPubKey exist in this wallet\". Furthermore, `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan` does not have watchonly, so with native descriptor wallets, it is not possible to have a wallet with both watchonly and non-watchonly things. Rather a wallet with `disable_private_keys` needs to be used for watchonly things.\r\n\r\nA `--descriptor` option was added to some tests (`wallet_basic.py`, `wallet_encryption.py`, `wallet_keypool.py`, `wallet_keypool_topup.py`, and `wallet_labels.py`) to allow for these tests to use descriptor wallets. Additionally, several RPCs are disabled for descriptor wallets (`importprivkey`, `importpubkey`, `importaddress`, `importmulti`, `addmultisigaddress`, `dumpprivkey`, `dumpwallet`, `importwallet`, and `sethdseed`).",

I am going to submit any further works as follow-ups, including:\r\n\r\n* Removing all python regex linters on the args, now that RPCMan can be used to generate any output, including the cli.cpp table\r\n* Auto-formatting and sanity checking the RPCExamples with RPCMan\r\n* Checking passed-in json in self-check. Removing redundant checks\r\n* Checking returned json against documentation to avoid regressions or false documentation\r\n* Compile the RPC documentation at compile-time to ensure it doesn't change at runtime and is completely static\r\n\r\n### Bugs found\r\n\r\n* The assert identified issue #18607 \r\n* The changes itself fixed bug #19250 ",

          "body": "The global `g_chainman` has recently been introduced in #17737. The chainstate manager is primarily needed for the assumeutxo feature, but it can also simplify testing in the future.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this pull is to make the global chainstate manager internal to validation, so that all external code does not depend on globals and that unit or fuzz tests can pass in their (potentially mocked) chainstate manager.\r\n\r\nI suggest reviewing the pull request commit-by-commit. It should be relatively straightforward refactoring that does not change behavior at all.",

          "body": "The current `*receivedby*` RPCs filter out coinbase transactions. This doesn't seem correct since an output to your address in a coinbase transaction *is* receiving those coins. \r\n\r\nThis PR corrects this behaviour. Also, a new option `include_immature_coinbase` is added (default=`false`) that includes immature coinbase transactions when set to true.\r\n\r\nHowever, since this is potentially a breaking change this PR introduces a hidden configuration option `-deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase`. This can be set to revert to previous behaviour. If no reports of broken workflow are received, then this option can be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14654.",

Instead of using `std::any`, which isn't available in c++11, or `void*`, which isn't type safe, it uses a small new `util::Ref` helper class, which acts like a simplified `std::any` that only holds references, not values.\r\n\r\nMotivation for writing this was to provide an simpler alternative to #18647 by Harris Brakmić (brakmic) which avoids some shortcomings of that PR (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18647#issuecomment-617878826)",

      "body": "Hi @ryanofsky \r\n\r\n> I really appreciate the effort here, but I don't think this PR is teneble, and I have a simpler alternative in #18740. \r\n\r\nSimpler is very often better!\r\n\r\n> This PR is too wide in scope changing things that don't need to be changed, and is accessing > node context in places that will make changes we do want more difficult. \r\n\r\nThis indeed is the case, but mostly because *g_rpc_node*, and later *g_rpc_chain*, were basically \"everywhere\". This of course should not serve as an excuse to write an even bigger \"solution\" for the original problem. \r\n\r\n> Specifically this PR is:\r\n> * Making spurious changes to httpserver which aren't necessary because it already supports context passing. These changes also have potential to cause bugs given fragility of libevent.\r\n\r\nAs I don't know much about libevent, I will simply agree on that.\r\n\r\n> * Using node type in httprpc rpc/server layers that don't otherwise contain node specific code (or even bitcoin specific code). These changes will make multiprocess and offline wallet work more difficult, and get in the way of any features that want to accept RPC requests outside of the node process.\r\n\r\nThe NodeContext structure is actually even bigger. It contains various things, so you are right. But also: _maybe NodeContext itself should be split into smaller parts_? To me, it looks like NodeContext carries many heavy things. I actually never needed NodeContext as a whole but merely a pointer/ref to one of its members. However, this is not important here, imo, so I'll leave it for another discussion.\r\n\r\n> * Adding NodeContext parameter to every single RPC method when most of these methods don't need it and some of them (wallet methods) should not have access to it. \r\n\r\nYes, it's not the cutest thing to do, but a bit less ugly than a global pointer. And as I said, I never needed NodeContext itself, only a pointer/ref from it.\r\n\r\n> This makes the change bigger and harder to review, \r\n\r\nTo understand why *g_rpc_node* is everywhere and how to deal with it correctly, was hard to me. :)\r\n\r\nLater then, *g_rpc_chain* came to the party. \r\n\r\n> and will potentially cause confusion and\r\n> accidental changes that will again make multiprocess and offline wallet work more difficult.\r\n\r\nAs I still lack enough knowledge about these areas, I can only agree with you.\r\n\r\n> * Making unit test initialization inconsistent with application initialization. Passing context through tableRPC.addNodeContext in one case and AppInitServers in the other case.\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n> * Not safely or consistently handling errors. Removing null checks in rest and rpc code and segfaulting when the context isn't available instead of returning HTTP errors\r\n\r\nI was actually checking for *nullptr* at the very beginning of the initialization. But, this is not important here, so the code as it is, is not stable enough. Accepted.\r\n\r\n> * Making spurious changes that complicate review, adding consts, removing consts, changing indentation, making manual changes that would be safer as scripted-diffs\r\n\r\nI use *clang format* as stated in Bitcoin docs. \r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit diff -U0 HEAD~1.. | ./contrib/devtools/clang-format-diff.py -p1 -i -v\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegarding **const/non-costs**: it was because the NodeContext has an implicitly deleted copy assignment constructor, because one of its members is a **unique_ptr**. So, I had to find a way around this impasse. This too is one of the things that make me believe, that NodeContext itself should be split into smaller parts. But, this is not that important here, I think.\r\n\r\n> * Not using recommended style, using pointers instead of references, using hungarian notation, using #include where a forward declaration would be more efficient\r\n\r\nI would like to know more about the *bitcoinic* coding style. If you have any doc/link please, let me know. I could not find anything. \r\n\r\n> * Making `NodeContext` a more ubiquitous presence in the codebase than it was ever meant to be (increasing from 66 to 266 usages).\r\n\r\nNodeContext should maybe be made even smaller, imo. So, yes, I agree with you.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> It was good to see this PR opened and have progress on #17548, and be useful as an experiment, \r\n\r\nYes, that was the initial motivation. The original issue https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17548 was hanging around for some time, so I thought, let's do something about it.\r\n\r\n> but I think this is not the best way forward and would recommend not doing more work on this PR\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it was the best way to forward *for me*, as it helped me a lot to understand some interesting parts of Bitcoin. And I thank you for that! However, you are right, it's not the best way to forward *for the project*, so I will close my PR, and will study your code and try it out. \r\n\r\nThanks again!",

See [doc/design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/design/multiprocess.md) for usage details and future plans.\r\n\r\nThe change is implemented by adding a new [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that spawns new wallet and node subprocesses that can be controlled over a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) by calling [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/node.h), [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/wallet.h), and [`ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/chain.h) methods. When running with split processes, you can see the IPC messages going back and forth in `-debug=1` output. Followup PR's #19460 and #19461 add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\r\n\r\nThe IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/ipc/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSlides from a presentation describing this change are available on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).\r\n",
