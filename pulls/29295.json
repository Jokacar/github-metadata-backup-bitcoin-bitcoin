    "body": "In #28983 I need to read and write two private keys to/from disk that are used by Stratum v2 peers to (optionally) authenticate us.\r\n\r\nFor the write part, I initially just put the key data into a `std::vector<unsigned char>` and then used a modified version of `WriteBinaryFile`. But @vasild pointed out in #29229 that:\r\n\r\n> `CKey` stores sensitive data and takes care to wipe it from memory when freed. In #28983 `Read/WriteBinaryData()` is used in a way that defeats that - the sensitive data will be copied to a temporary variable (ordinary `std::vector`) for IO. Can we change `Read/WriteBinaryData()` to operate directly on `CKey` in such a way that data goes directly from `CKey` to the disk?\r\n\r\nThis PR tries a different approach that hopefully addresses that. See https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/32 for how it's used (in `sv2_template_provider.cpp`).",

This PR adds support for `std::vector<unsigned char>>`.\r\n\r\nIt also uses `AutoFile` now.\r\n\r\nThis is [update: probably _not_] used in #28983 to store the static key for the Template Provider, in a manner very similar to how we store the Tor v3 and i2p key. However it made no sense to me to store a `CKey` as plain text. See commit \"Persist static key for Template Provider\" for how it's used.\r\n\r\nIt uses a template and leverages the fact that both `std::string` and `std::vector<unsigned char>>` have an `insert()` method that can take a char array.\r\n\r\nThe `unsigned char` support is not used in this PR, but tests do cover it.",

          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. See the original branch for the evolution of the spec.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review? \r\n\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review. Probably starting with ECDH and the Noise Protocol.\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nSilent Payments also needs the ECDH module, so I cherry-picked the commit from #28122. It uses ECDH is a slightly different way, but perhaps there's more overlap to be had.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Upstream issues\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Noise\r\n\r\n- [ ] use EllSwift https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66, implemented in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/28\r\n- [ ] certificate signing issue: https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/717, fix in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/29\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [x] persist static key (needs #29229)\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [x] create `Sv2Transport` subclass similar to `V2Transport`: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/27\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n- [ ] adjust base58 encoding of authority public key https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/721\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [x] hold on to templates a bit after a block is found https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/709 (in case of race to prevent downstream crashes, though we still wouldn't relay it without additional changes)\r\n- [ ] hold on to template transactions even if the mempool drops them (for some time)\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

      "body": "I added `Check()` when deserialising.\r\n\r\n> Not familiar with the stratumv2 spec, but this seems odd to me\r\n\r\nIn Stratum v2 a pool or Template Provider (implemented in #28983) may (optionally) have an identity. This is necessary to prevent stealing hash rate (at least for the pool). In order to protect that identity in the long run, you can keep its private key on a different machine, generate a static key for the server and sign a certificate for that static key.\r\n\r\n> not a good fit for CKey\r\n\r\nWhy would you not use a `CKey` to hold a private key?\r\n\r\n> FWIW, there is CPrivKey for producing a serialized OpenSSL private key\r\n\r\nTIL. There's two issues with `CPrivKey`:\r\n\r\n1. It's designed to always be used in conjunction with a public key. That makes sense for the wallet which has to deal with encrypted key, and where any data corruption is catastrophic.\r\n\r\nWith Stratum v2 you can just make a new static key if something goes wrong. It's more similar to how we handle Tor v3 and I2P private keys.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to use the confusingly named `GetPrivKey()` instead of `<<`, and it's possible to `Load()` with a dummy public key and `fSkipCheck = false`. But having straight-forward `<<` and `>>` seems cleaner.\r\n\r\n2. It uses the needlessly large OpenSSL encoding. At least in Stratum v2 there's never a need to import or export private keys. We just need to store them. The encoding is also incorrect (for Stratum v2): it just pretends to be a compressed key, but in reality public keys are encoded as x-only. There's no point in shoe-horning data into a standard we don't need and use incorrectly. On the other hand, there's no harm in it - the wallet does it too. \r\n\r\nI could switch to OpenSSL encoding. Either by moving the code from `GetPrivKey` to `Serialize()`, or vice versa, call `GetPrivKey()` from `Serialize`. `Load` would need a more involved refactor to separate out the dependency.\r\n\r\n@vasild wrote earlier:\r\n\r\n> Is it not worth saving `CKey::fCompressed` to disk as well and fully support ser/unser of any `CKey`?\r\n\r\nI added this before, but given the existence of `CPrivKey` I'm tempted to drop this. That makes it more clear that is only for keys that are intended to be used with Schnorr signatures, x-only ECDH, etc. I.e. keys for which there is no valid DER encoding.",

      "body": "> Why would you not use a `CKey` to hold a private key?\r\n\r\nMy point was not \"CKey shouldn't be used for private keys.\" My point is `CKey` (or at least my understanding of it) is meant for a *specific* kind(s) of \"private key\" i.e. a private key that represents a private/public key pair and is intended to be used in that context. It also seems we want to know where the key came from and ensure that it is valid, hence the only ways to load a secret key are the `DecodeSecret` method, which decodes a BIP32 ExtPrivKey string, and the `Load` method which takes an openssl key and verifies the corresponding public key (I suspect `fSkipCheck` is only there for performance reasons and not to indicate \"use `skipCheck` if you want to load generic secret data without a public key\").\r\n\r\nAgain, I don't fully understand your usecase, but adding generic methods to de-serialize bytes from *anywhere* into a `CKey` and methods to serialize a `CKey` into 32 bytes without any context about where the key came from or what the key represents seems like a bad idea for `CKey`.\r\n\r\n> It's more similar to how we handle Tor v3 and I2P private keys.\r\n\r\nI did a quick grep for `CKey` and `<key.h>` and didn't see anything related to Tor or I2P. Can you provide an example of what you mean here, because I'm not sure I fully understand your point.",

We need its pubkey, perform (Elligator-Swift) ECDH with it, etc. That's what a CKey is for.\r\n\r\nYour 1st objection to using `CPrivKey` was that `CPrivKey` is always meant to be used in conjunction with a public key (implying that this SV2 key is not), but it sounds like we will also always be using a public key with the SV2 key, so I don't understand your 1st objection to using `CPrivKey` or why we would need a \"dummy public key.\"\r\n\r\nYour second point makes sense to me in that if this is meant to be an `XOnlyPubKey`, then passing it around in DER encoding is incorrect / confusing. But by the same argument, what you are doing now is also incorrect and confusing in that you are serializing and deserializing 32 bytes with no indication it is meant for an `XOnlyPublicKey`.\r\n\r\nAgain, I really think we should avoid adding generic `Serialize/Deserialize` methods on `CKey` and so far your objections to using existing methods doesn't seem convincing enough to warrant adding two new methods to `CKey`.\r\n\r\nIf your usecase is \"read 32 bytes and create a CKey,\" why not just read the 32 bytes and use the `CKey.Set` method? Your `Unserialize` code seems to duplicate what `Set` is already doing. For de-serializing, why not just get the byte data and write it out, and then destroy the key?\r\n",

Putting the password in a config file adds complexity and no security unless the system admin really knows what they're doing.

This is why a certificate can be signed on a different machine, and users can simply rotate the server (static) key when it's compromised.

That last key can be on a separate machine it's the one a pool might publish on their website. It signs the static key. We need to store that static key. It should be rotated if the server is compromised. Otherwise you'd have to make sign and copy a new certificate on every restart.\r\n\r\n> BIP324Cipher is doing it in the way I suggested\r\n\r\nYes, BIP324 _only_ uses ephemeral keys, there's no identity by design.\r\n\r\n> The descriptor is the encoding information: you import a private key wrapped in a descriptor which tells you exactly what the key is meant for.

      "body": "I looked into the possibility of subclassing `CKey` or making a similar class from scratch, but that got too complicated too quickly.\r\n\r\nSo I'm keeping the approach as-is, and will work around it in some more verbose way if this PR doesn't make it.\r\n\r\nI did however bring back the `compressed` boolean. That way the serialisation maps 1-to-1 to `CKey`.\r\n\r\nI think that if the wallet was designed from scratch it would use 32 byte encoding for private keys. The DER encoding adds no value, we don't even use it for export and import and the conversion is expensive (according to the `GetPrivKey()`'s code comment). It's not worth overhauling the wallet, but it seems reasonable to discourage DER encoding use for any other application.",

      "body": "> I think the newly added generic ser/unser methods to CKey are harmless.\r\n\r\nIts adding a footgun to `CKey`. The class is making sure to keep the secret data secure in memory and to free it when the key is gone, so allowing the key to be created directly from (potentially insecure) data on disk and allowing the key to be written out unencrypted to disk without destroying the key seems like an anti-pattern. You could argue that the existing methods (e.g. `GetPrivKey`) are also footguns, but that is not a good argument for adding more footguns to the class. It also seems strange to me that all of this care is being taken to keep the secret data secure in memory when you are reading writing it unencrypted to and from disk.\r\n\r\nEven if harmless, this still seems unnecessary since your usecase can be accomplished without it. If your requirements for SV2 were to change and *not* need core to be generating this secret, or not need the secret written to disk, then we would want to remove these unused methods from `CKey`, hence better to continue without adding usecase specific methods to `CKey`.\r\n\r\n> in a way that is less efficient (more copying) and more prone to errors\r\n\r\nThis seems specific to the current implementation? I imagine there is a way to do it efficiently with the class as is. Maybe once the StratumV2 spec is finalized and the implementation finished, you can reopen this if it still makes sense as a refactor?",

      "body": "> It also seems strange to me that all of this care is being taken to keep the secret data secure in memory when you are reading writing it unencrypted to and from disk.\r\n\r\nThat's literally what the wallet does by default. `CKey` provides extra security for free, so it's better to use it. The optional wallet encryption feature makes use of this security feature, by ensuring that once a wallet is (re)locked the key data is erased from memory.\r\n\r\nIt would take _additional_ code for Sv2 to handle the key material insecurely. Namely merging #29229 and convering the `CKey` to and from `Span<std::byte>` before saving it.\r\n\r\n> You could argue that the existing methods (e.g. `GetPrivKey`) are also footguns, but that is not a good argument for adding more footguns to the class.\r\n\r\nThey're not footguns. They're merely needlessly complicated ways to serialize / unserialize key data.\r\n\r\nThere's no way for `CKey` to protect callers other than by cleaning up after itself. You also can't accidentally store a key on disk by somehow inadvertently calling the serialise function, it requires opening a file.\r\n\r\n> If your requirements for SV2 were to change and not need core to be generating this secret\r\n\r\nThat's an argument for holding off merging this PR until #28983 / #29346 have more concept ACK's. I'm not expecting the Sv2 protocol to be overhauled so that it's no longer necessary to generate and persist keys. It's conceivable that we don't implement support for it, specifically we could decide to only support plain text connections and require users to install a proxy (not my preference though).",

The optional wallet encryption feature makes use of this security feature, by ensuring that once a wallet is (re)locked the key data is erased from memory.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/managing-wallets.md#12-encrypting-the-wallet documents why encryption is not on by default, and seems like a reasonable tradeoff given that loss of a passphrase means total loss of funds. In your case, loss of a passphrase would simply mean regenerating a new key.\r\n\r\n> > You could argue that the existing methods (e.g. `GetPrivKey`) are also footguns, but that is not a good argument for adding more footguns to the class.\r\n> \r\n> They're not footguns. They're merely needlessly complicated ways to serialize / unserialize key data.\r\n\r\nI'd be more inclined if this PR was proposing a general refactor that got rid of existing 'needlessly complicated ways' of serializing/unserializing, rather than just adding yet another method. That way, we end up with a well documented and standard way of doing things.\r\n\r\n> > If your requirements for SV2 were to change and not need core to be generating this secret\r\n> \r\n> That's an argument for holding off merging this PR until #28983 / #29346 have more concept ACK's. I'm not expecting the Sv2 protocol to be overhauled so that it's no longer necessary to generate and persist keys. It's conceivable that we don't implement support for it, specifically we could decide to only support plain text connections and require users to install a proxy (not my preference though).\r\n\r\nSo lets hold off? You're not blocked on this PR being merged, and it seems we wont need this change if the other PRs don't progress. I imagine there are also more possibilities, such as doing this optional identity management outside of Bitcoin Core and using the keys similar to how we do I2P/Tor, where the secret is read as `Bytes`.\r\n\r\n",

As long as RPC and ZMQ are the only way for external tools to interact with Bitcoin Core, that approach adds too much overhead and delay. We're trying to push new block templates out as quickly as possible, preferable as soon as a new transaction enters the mempool that increases the total block template fees by enough to justify the bandwidth.

          "title": "Stratum v2 Template Provider (take 3)",
          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. Compared to #28983 it introduces EllSwift in the handshake and fixes various bugs. I used that opportunity to change the branch name, which makes testing against [SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) slightly easier. There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #26812\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

      "body": "(reviewing af25cfcbabe96283625f3a32f493940658a5d1e5)\r\n\r\nIf I can summarize the disagreement here, it seems like there are currently three ways to serialize `CKey` data:\r\n\r\n1. Call `CKey::GetPrivKey()` to save in in an openssl format and use `CKey::Load()` to load it.\r\n2. Call `EncodeSecret()` and `DecodeSecret()` and to store and load it as base58 strings.\r\n3. Call `CKey::IsCompressed()` to get the `fCompressed` bit and call `CKey::data()` or treat it as a span to get the raw bytes. Then call `CKey::Set()` to load the compression bit and key bytes.\r\n\r\nThis PR is adding a adding a fourth way:\r\n\r\n4. Adding `CKey::Serialize()` and `CKey::Unserialize()` methods to serialize the compressed bit and key data into a stream object, and also calling `CKey::Check()` method during deserialization. The original implementation of this did not include the compressed bit. But then it was changed to [add it](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29295#event-11598047343), before [dropping it again](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29295#event-11626222915), and then [adding it again](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29295#event-11670037331).\r\n\r\nJosibake is arguing that new serialization method is redundant, and might make it easier to make mistakes like leaking keys by not zeroing after freeing, storing keys without encryption when encryption should be used, storing the raw bytes without format information when key format should be recorded, and forgetting to check assumptions such as whether uncompressed keys are allowed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand though, a lot of these problems already exist currently and the new method is not markedly worse than existing ones, and in some cases it may be better. For example if serializing with DataStream, a secure allocator will be used unlike with `EncodeSecret` and `std::string`.\r\n\r\nOverall I think I agree with Josie that adding this new `CKey` serialization method seems to make a confusing situation a little worse and doesn't seem to offer major benefits over `CKey::Set`. But I don't think the amount of harm would be great.\r\n\r\nI'd also note that this change would allow dropping CKey serialization code from #10102:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Details</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/56ef459b573461087fbe4f39d9b0a7108936335f/src/ipc/capnp/wallet.capnp#L141-L144\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/56ef459b573461087fbe4f39d9b0a7108936335f/src/ipc/capnp/wallet.cpp#L130-L140\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nBut I'm not sure if this is a good thing. It seems reasonable to me that there maybe should be a little extra friction around serializing private keys, so they don't get serialized automatically without thinking about the best way to do it, and whether it is necessary.\r\n\r\n",

As @ryanofsky mentioned, I think it's good to have a little friction here to make the implementer think \"should I really be doing this?\"\r\n\r\n> This seems an overkill way to avoid adding a standard serialization method.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's fair to claim you are adding a standard method here. As I mentioned before: \r\n\r\n> I'd be more inclined if this PR was proposing a general refactor that got rid of existing 'needlessly complicated ways' of serializing/unserializing, rather than just adding yet another method. That way, we end up with a well documented and standard way of doing things.\r\n\r\nBut this PR is only adding yet another method, which is unnecessary considering your use case can be accomplished with the existing methods.",

Since nonces must not be reused, this PR holds them exclusively in memory, so a restart of the software will require a restart of the MuSig2 signing process. Additionally, the current MuSig API in libsecp basically involves us holding onto and passing around an opaque libsecp object. There may be some additional work there to make the code more ergonomic.",
