    "body": "A transaction does not necessarily have to belong to either the migrated wallet (with the private keys) and the watchonly wallet (with watchonly things), it could have multiple outputs with each isminetype. So we should be putting such transactions in one or the other wallet, but rather putting it in both.\r\n\r\nI've added a test for this behavior, however the test also revealed a few other issues. Notably, it revealed that `migratewallet` would have the watchonly wallet rescan from genesis when it is reloaded at the end of migration. This could be a cause for migration appearing to be very slow. This is resolved by first writing best block records to the watchonly and solvable wallets, as well as updating the test to make sure that rescans don't happen.\r\n\r\nThe change to avoid rescans also found an issue where some of our early exits would result in unloading the wallet even though nothing happened. So there is also a commit to reload the wallet for such early exits.",
