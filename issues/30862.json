    "title": "Race condition between ZMQ UpdateTip and getblocktemplate",
    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nWhen ZMQ announces a new chain tip via \"sequence\" \"C\" message, if `getblocktemplate` is called immediately, it can return a block template that does not reflect the new chain tip.\r\n\r\nThis is important for Braidpool, which needs to switch to a new chain tip as quickly as possible when a new block comes in.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n`getblocktemplate` should return a result consistent with the information announced via ZMQ and correctly reflect the current chain tip.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThis was seen on the `cpunet` testnet fork (which does not touch any of the consensus or ZMQ code). The bug report there is: https://github.com/braidpool/bitcoin/issues/1#issuecomment-2341397203\r\n\r\nThis occurs infrequently and it may be necessary to run the miner script for a day or more to see it.\r\n\r\nThe script that receives the ZMQ messages and calls `getblocktemplate` is here: https://github.com/braidpool/bitcoin/blob/cpunet/contrib/cpunet/miner\n\n### Relevant log output\n\nPlease see https://github.com/braidpool/bitcoin/issues/1#issuecomment-2341397203 for log output.\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nBitcoin Core version v27.99.0-e8b157f687eb-dirty\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nArch Linux 6.10.5-zen1-1-zen #1 ZEN SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n8 core Ryzen, SSD.",
