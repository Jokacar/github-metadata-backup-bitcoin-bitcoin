      "body": "The idea here is to restructure `CNode` / `CConnman` / `PeerManager` a bit. Currently, net.h combines all the p2p logic in between the very low-level socket stuff (sock.h) and the high-level protocol (net_processing.h). This splits that into two parts: node/node.h that now contains `CNode`, `TransportV1`, etc that focusses on dealing with a single peer; and leaves `CConnman` in net.h, with the idea that that focusses on coordinating amongst the many peers we have (so, opening new connections, choosing what to evict, working out which node to give cpu time to next, etc).\r\n\r\nThis PR just moves code around; the idea is that future PRs would improve the separation more (see https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commits/202308-netnode and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28252#issuecomment-1680222391) and, eventually, breaking the circular dependency between `PeerManager` and `CConnman` (ie, have `PeerManager` only deal with a single node at a time, eg see the `PushMessage` changes in the repo just mentioned).",

See #27463 for project tracking and #28031 for how this code is used.\r\n\r\nSeparating this PR was suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28031#discussion_r1261414179.\r\n\r\nChanges here:\r\n- Change params to wtxid instead of txid.\r\n- Track total size (`CTransaction::GetTotalSize()` of orphans stored, as well as the size per peer.\r\n- Support having multiple announcers for the same tx. This helps us retry resolving the same orphan with multiple peers if it fails the first time.\r\n- Store the deduplicated missing parent txids in `OrphanTx` so that we don't need to calculate them again later on.\r\n- Return the erased wtxids from `EraseForBlock` which includes orphans that conflicted with the block. This helps us delete those orphan resolution attempts from our tracker.\r\n- Enable limiting the total size of orphans instead of just the total count. No new limits are introduced, the default is maximum count * maximum tx size.\r\n- Unit tests + fuzzer.",
