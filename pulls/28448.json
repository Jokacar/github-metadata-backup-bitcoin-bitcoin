          "body": "**Sigops**\r\n\r\nTwo recent F2Pool blocks violated the sigops limit. Both by 3.\r\n\r\nI suspect they were not using `getblocktemplate`. If you look at the [template](https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/00000000000000000004e0ec4f27bd3347381e8e19ed98d7f918e8c1c292ae97) right before the valid block at the same height, which was produced two minutes later, you'll see that it matches the block with 3 small transactions difference. In other words, the valid block producer likely did use `getblocktemplate` around the same time and did not experience an issue.\r\n\r\nIt's also clear by looking at [Mempool.Space](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000004e0ec4f27bd3347381e8e19ed98d7f918e8c1c292ae97) that the valid block excluded many large bare multisig transactions. Those transactions paid more than enough in fees to be included, but we would have excluded them due to running out of sigops.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in `BlockAssembler::addPackageTxs` and `TestPackage` we simply don't add a package to the block if it doesn't fit the remaining weight or sigops. Custom block construction software might not do that. I initially though they might have forgotten to check SegWit related sigops, but that seems unlikely given that they were only off by 3 in both blocks.\r\n\r\nI suspect their mistake was to not count the number of sigops in the coinbase: it pays to legacy P2PKH which uses 4 sigops. Our code reserves 400 sigops for the coinbase, so would not have caused this.\r\n\r\nAnyway, while checking our code I added a few extra fields to the block statistics of `getblocktemplate`:\r\n\r\n* `sigops`: total sigops for the block excluding the coinbase\r\n* `coinbase_reserved_sigops`: how many sigops we reserve for the coinbase (400)\r\n* `weightlimit`\r\n* `coinbase_reserved_weight`\r\n\r\nI added a belt and suspenders check for the sigops limit in the RPC code. Note that we already check it when adding packages to a block _and_ in `TestBlockValidity`.\r\n\r\n**Segwit**\r\n\r\n~I also removed the need to set `{\"rules\": \"!segwit\"}`, the generation of pre-segwit blocks, and the test code that checks activation.~ _update 2023-08-18: commit removed_",
