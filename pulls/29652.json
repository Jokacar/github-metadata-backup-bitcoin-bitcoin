    "body": "This PR updates the `CWallet::chainStateFlushed` method to write the `m_last_block_processed` locator to the database as the wallet's best block instead of the chain tip locator.\r\n\r\nSaving the last block processed locator as the best block is less fragile than saving `chainStateFlushed` locator as best block.\r\n\r\nRight now wallet code relies on `blockConnected` notifications being sent before `chainStateFlushed` notifications, and on the `chainStateFlushed` locator pointing to the last connected block. But this is a fragile assumption that can be easily broken by `ActivateBestChain`/`ConnectTrace` changes, and in fact is currently broken (since d96c59cc5cd2f73f1f55c133c52208671fe75ef3 from #25740) when the assumeutxo snapshot block is validated. In that case the background validation `chainStateFlushed` notification is sent _before_ the `blockConnected` notification so writing the locator as the best block would record a best block that was never processed. This specific change does not cause a problem for the wallet, because the wallet ignores events from the background validation chainstate. But nothing prevents similar out-of-order `chainStateFlushed` notifications from being sent in the future, so it is safer for the wallet to not rely on the chain tip sent in `chainStateFlushed` notifications.\r\n\r\nA good followup to this change would probably be to drop the `ChainStateFlushed` locator argument entirely so it is not misused in the future. Indexing code already stopped using this locator argument a long time ago for identifying the best block (in 4368384f1d267b011e03a805f934f5c47e2ca1b2 from #14121), though it is currently using the locator argument to log diagnostic warnings.",

      "message": "wallet: Avoid potentially writing incorrect best block locator\n\nI noticed while debugging #24230 that the ChainStateFlushed notification can be\nsent with a locator pointing to a different block than the block in the last\nBlockConnected notification. This is bad because it could cause the wallet to\nrecord that it is synced to a later block than it ever processed, and make it\npotentially fail to scan blocks for relevant transactions if it is unloaded and\nreloaded.\n\nThis problem should probably not happen in practice, because normally the\nlocator in the ChainStateFlushed notification does point to the block sent in\nthe last BlockConnected notification. But because of the way ActivateBestChain\naccumulates block connected notifications, and the fact that FlushStateToDisk\nis called from many different code paths, this isn't guaranteed. (The new\nassumeutxo logic also introduces a situation where this is never the case: when\nthe background chain reaches the snapshot height and validates the snapshot,\nthe background chain is flushed before block connected notifications are sent.)\n\nIn any case, it is better if the wallet writes a locator actually pointing to\nthe last block that it processed instead of writing the locator validation code\npasses to ChainStateFlushed, so this commit switches to the right locator.\n\nA good followup to this change would probably be to drop the ChainStateFlushed\nlocator argument entirely so it is not misused in the future. Indexing code\nalready stopped using this locator argument a long time ago for identifying the\nbest block (in 4368384f1d267b011e03a805f934f5c47e2ca1b2 from #14121), but it is\nstill using the locator argument to log diagnostic warnings.",

          "body": "This PR lets indexing code mostly run outside of the node process. It also improves indexing sync logic, which is moved out of indexing code to a new [`node::SyncChain()`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/8d8cdcb37005030f646ba3c45f7f54f556efb8bf/src/node/chain.h#L24-L39) function.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the commits in this PR are small refactoring changes that move code from `src/index/` to `src/node/`, or replace references to node types like `CBlockIndex`, `CChain`, `CChainState` in index code. There are only two commits affecting indexing sync logic which make complicated or substantive changes:\r\n\r\n- [`8746b35301c5` indexes: Rewrite chain sync logic, remove racy init](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24230/commits/8746b35301c5f65ff3200555fb2b82417fd2c758)\r\n- [`ad88f50ddd12` indexes: Initialize indexes without holding cs_main](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24230/commits/ad88f50ddd129dddd974bbf9fd7d86ec86b65508)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commit messages have more details about these and other changes. Followups to this PR will reuse indexing sync code for wallets (#15719, #11756) and let indexes run in separate processes (#10102)",

(Included in this PR)\r\n* Ensuring pruning doesn't go too far for a desired-functional wallet backup. (Questionable, since you probably lose the node if you need the backup anyway?)\r\n* Allowing users to temporarily disable block indexes and filters, without pruning cutting them off from catching up later.\r\n* Avoiding pruning out from under external wallets (Armory, EPS, etc) that might need block data.\r\n* External block indexes/filters, etc.\r\n\r\nBy design, users retain complete control over prune locks, and can delete them out from under applications using them. This is to avoid circumstances where a prune lock has been set, by an application that may no longer be used.\r\n",
