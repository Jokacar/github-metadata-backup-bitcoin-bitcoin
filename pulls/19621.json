    "body": "_This is demo code for a sender-initiated version of package-relay. This is not proposed for merging, only to illustrate package relay design with trade-offs compared to #16401. See my update on #14895 to advance discussions on package-relay._\r\n\r\nFew design choices of interest:\r\n* introduce new p2p messages, `sendpackages`, `MSG_PACKAGE`, `package` and new `package_id` identifier incorporated to the INV/GETDATA control logic : https://gist.github.com/ariard/10924249b3b7f6e239d80895372839b8\r\n* add a new `sendpackage` rpc to let a higher-application signals a chain of transactions and such start a propagation on the p2p network\r\n* integrate a `PackageCache` to internally cache the mapping package_id -> txids/wtxids, as they need to be persistent across a round-trip between upstream/downstream peers, it must be DoS resistant\r\n*  build on #16401 `AcceptMultipleTransactions` with a package policy restriction to 2-tx only, make it easier to reason on for replacement\r\n* allow for package replacement based on newer feerate higher that the union of feerate of all transactions conflicted, no dedup for now between conflicted set\r\n* don't redundantly send a transaction via INV(MSG_TX) if we know an associated package and peer signal package relay support\r\n* TODO: integrate package_id with overhaul transaction request/AlreadyHave to save further on bandwidth\r\n",

      "message": "Add package-acceptance logic to mempool\n\nAccepting a single transaction to the mempool only succeeds if (among other\nthings) the feerate of the transaction is greater than both the min relay fee\nand the mempool min fee. Consequently, a transaction below the minimum fee\nmay not be accepted to the mempool, even if we later learn of a transaction\nwith a high relay fee that depends on it.\n\nThis commit adds a function that will accept a package of transactions to the\nmempool, with the following restrictions:\n\n- All package transactions must be direct parents of the final transaction.\n  This is a simple heuristic for ensuring that a candidate list of transactions\n  is in fact a package (we wouldn't want arbitrary transactions to be paying\n  for random low feerate transactions)\n\n- The feerate of the package, as a whole, exceeds the mempool min fee and the\n  min relay fee.\n\n- No transactions in the mempool conflict with any transactions in the package.\n  This is a simplification that makes the logic easier to write. Without this\n  requirement, we would need to do additional checks to ensure that no parent\n  transaction would evict a transaction from the mempool that some other child\n  depends on.\n\n- The ancestor/descendant size limits are calculated assuming that any mempool\n  ancestor of any candidate transaction is an ancestor of all the candidate\n  transactions.\n  This allows for doing simpler calculations to ensure that we're staying\n  within the mempool's package limits. If we eliminated this, we would need to\n  do much more careful package calculations for each candidate transaction and each\n  in-mempool ancestor.\n\nThis commit does not include any accessor function for utilizing this logic (eg\nby exposing this function at the p2p or rpc layer).",

          "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about some improvements to transaction relay and wanted some feedback about the design goals.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nA transaction is only accepted to our mempool and then relayed to our peers if (a) our mempool already has all unconfirmed dependencies of the transaction, and (b) the transaction itself passes a bunch of policy checks (feerate, package size limits, etc).\r\n\r\nIt is possible for one transaction to fail our feerate policy check, but had it been bundled with another child transaction, that the transactions together should make it in to our mempool (eg because the child's feerate is sufficiently high).  Here are some scenarios where this can come up:\r\n\r\n * A node on the network has a smaller mempool than the default/typical setting.  Our default mempool size is 300MB (huge); it seems like it should be the case that someone running a node with, say, a 20MB mempool ought to have all the transactions that will be appearing in the next block.  However, nodes running with smaller mempools can have a higher effective minimum feerate required for transaction acceptance (this is a consequence of our mempool limiting/eviction policy), and so high feerate children of a low feerate parent -- which might appear in the next block -- may never make it in to the mempool of such a node.\r\n\r\n * Matt Corallo recently wrote about an example on the bitcoin-dev mailing list involving lightning transactions, where pre-signed transactions might be broadcast to the blockchain long after they were generated, and thus not have been created with a fee that is sufficient to be confirmed quickly (or even be accepted to node mempools).  In such situations, channel participants may need to use chained transactions (CPFP) in order to increase the confirmation speed of such transactions, and that implies we may need to introduce a mechanism for those parent transactions to be relayed along with their higher feerate children, even if the parent transaction would be rejected by itself.\r\n\r\n*Are there other scenarios that suffer without a package relay solution, which have unique design requirements?*\r\n\r\n# Design questions\r\n\r\n## Who is responsible for initiating package relay, sender or recipient?\r\n\r\nWhile the sender of a transaction that is chained off a low-fee parent is well-positioned to guess that a transaction might need package relay in order to propagate, expecting relayers to do the same seems onerous and potentially bandwidth wasteful.  For example, one way for a sender-initiated package relay system to work might be for a sender to announce via an INV (or similar) all ancestor txid's along with a child txid.  However, what would the protocol look like beyond that first hop -- would each node on the network initiate package relay with their peers as well?  It seems like this could be used in a way that would cause the same txid's to be announced repeatedly on the same links in the network, which seems wasteful.  Is there a sender-initiated strategy that works better than this naive idea that we should consider?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the recipient of a transaction can tell if a transaction's parents are missing and can therefore know to initiate package relay from the sending peer (which means that package relay would only occur on links that require it, eg to/from low-memory-mempool nodes).\r\n\r\n## Should we update the p2p protocol to accommodate package relay, or rely on existing functionality?\r\n\r\nIn theory, we may be able to shoehorn a recipient-initiated package relay scheme within the existing p2p protocol.  A recipient who needs the parents of a transaction could iteratively request them, and then topologically sort the result once all ancestors have arrived, and then proceed with validation.\r\n\r\nBut in practice, it seems like it might be much simpler to reason about the code and computational complexity if we add some kind of special p2p messages to assist in the process, so that rather than iteratively request parents (for example) we could just ask a peer for all unconfirmed ancestors of a transaction, perhaps even already sorted in topological order. It's also possible that it'd be helpful to add information or requirements around the package feerate of such packages.\r\n\r\nThe obvious benefit to not updating the p2p protocol is that we could implement package relay in a new release and the whole network would support providing packages to new software.  The downside is potential code complexity and possibly somewhat less efficient processing of transactions due to repeatedly having to check for missing ancestors and doing the topological sort (but perhaps those could be mitigated with the right implementation).\r\n\r\n## What Denial-of-Service concerns do we need to address?\r\n\r\nIn addition to the usual things we worry about (bandwidth attacks on the network, CPU or other resource exhaustion attacks), does package relay need to incorporate further anti-DoS measures to be useful?\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose there is some low feerate transaction A, and it has multiple children: B, C, D, E ...  One of our peers relays transaction B to us, so we ask for A, but decide that A+B is not good enough for our mempool.  How many times will we be willing to re-try A, if C, D, E, etc are also relayed to us?\r\n\r\nOne approach might be to only attempt the same transaction once over some time period (say by adding it to our reject filter, which gets cleared out every block), so that the same transaction cannot be repeatedly used to CPU-attack us; however, this would seem to conflict with the lightning use-case, where we would not want an adversary to be able to prevent relay of some parent transaction.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, any situation where we might test a transaction's signatures prior to a (package-) policy failure that prevents the transaction from being ultimately accepted to the mempool would open the door to CPU-exhaustion attacks.  This would imply a design for package processing and acceptance where policy checks on the whole package are performed before signature validation -- then, if a signature is found to be invalid, we could ban the peer.  Are there any other practical solutions for this?  If we take this approach, then it seems we could re-try A over and over with limited downside.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note the existing resource usage that transaction relay can already incur -- when we receive a new transaction, we generally have to retrieve the inputs from the utxo set, which typically means that an attacker can make us do disk reads costlessly. Given that this seems difficult to avoid, I don't think package relay needs to limit an attacker's ability to have us look up inputs.  I think this implies that in the previous example, being willing to retry A+C, A+D, etc and looking up A's inputs over and over shouldn't be considered an increase in attack surface.\r\n\r\n## Consistency requirements?\r\n\r\nAre there any additional consistency requirements we should (or must) impose on package relay?  Currently it is the case that\r\nthe order that transactions are received by a node does determine which transactions make it into the mempool (some examples that come to mind: transactions that are just at the mempool min fee rate; transactions that depend on common ancestors which are near the descendant chain limit; a transaction that would conflict with another vs descendants of that original transaction; I'm sure there are more examples).\r\n\r\nNaively, we might also expect it to be the case that depending on how a package is relayed, it might affect whether a child transaction is accepted.  For instance, if we have a parent transaction A, with two children B and C, then it's possible that B+A has a high enough feerate to be accepted via package relay, but C+A does not -- so relaying B first would get all 3 transactions in, while relaying C first would only get A and B in.\r\n\r\nThis effect could be magnified if there were (for example) anti-DoS rules that would prevent A from being attempted too many times.\r\n\r\nWould this kind of behavior significantly harm any use cases that we're trying to support?",

          "body": "We currently have two structures for per-peer data:\r\n\r\n- `CNode` in net, which should just contain connection layer data (eg socket, send/recv buffers, etc), but currently also contains some application layer data (eg tx/block inventory).\r\n- `CNodeState` in net processing, which contains p2p application layer data, but requires cs_main to be locked for access.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a third struct `Peer`, which is for p2p application layer data, and doesn't require cs_main. Eventually all application layer data from `CNode` should be moved to `Peer`, and any data that doesn't strictly require cs_main should be moved from `CNodeState` to `Peer` (probably all of `CNodeState` eventually).\r\n\r\n`Peer` objects are stored as shared pointers in a net processing global map `g_peer_map`, which is protected by `g_peer_mutex`. To use a `Peer` object, `g_peer_mutex` is locked, a copy of the shared pointer is taken, and the lock is released. Individual members of `Peer` are protected by different mutexes that guard related data. The lifetime of the `Peer` object is managed by the shared_ptr refcount.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `Peer` object and moves the misbehaving data from `CNodeState` to `Peer`. This allows us to immediately remove 15 `LOCK(cs_main)` instances.\r\n\r\nFor more motivation see #19398",

Add separate fee-checking logic for clients that need to enforce max fee rates, then remove the `absurdFee` logic from ATMP.\r\n\r\nATMP's `nAbsurdFee` argument is used to enforce user-specific behavior (it is not policy since it isn't applied consistently: it is only ever used in RPC and wallet, and set to 0 everywhere else internally). It should be removed from `AcceptToMemoryPool` because (1) validation results/mempool behavior should not be user-specific and (2) enforcing a max fee rate should be the responsibility of the client instead of the mempool.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR does not intend to _remove_ protection from high fees, just re-delegate the responsibility to clients.",

          "body": "This is an implementation of [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518), using primitives in the BIP-330 (see the updated spec [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki)). Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk on the topic is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670).\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I'll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n- save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n- increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n- improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\nObviously looking for review, let's try to start with a high-level concerns, and keep nits for later.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nPlease don't be scared of 8,000 LOC added. 7,000 of them is minisketch added as a subtree.\r\n\r\nP.P.S.\r\nMy experiments of running this code live (slightly outdated) with a script to replicate the experiment: [here1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#issuecomment-599241490) and [here2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#issuecomment-600388543).\r\n",

For the p2p part, the sender-initiated approach and the package ids caching might be of interest for the conceptual discussion when we introduce p2p packages. I don't have interest to keep working on that version of package relay but I'm staying interested to review any work or draft in that area.",
