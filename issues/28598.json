The alternative would be to present the assumed state some other way, which might be confusing.\r\n\r\nBut if we do that, we need to add an exception to our policy of not spending unconfirmed received. Depending on the GUI status is implemented, I suspect this will just work, because coin selection ignores assume-utxo stuff.",
