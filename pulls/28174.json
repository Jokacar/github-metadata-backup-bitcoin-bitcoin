The changes are the following:\r\n* Adding emojis 🚀 which makes the document more vibrant\r\n* Use a more casual and interactive language to engage the reader\r\n\r\nAll the original technical contents were preserved, and the structure of the document remains the same to ensure that users still find the information they're accustomed to. \r\n\r\nThese changes aim not only to keep the document detailed and informative but also to make it easy-to-read and engaging, especially to users who may be new to the Bitcoin Core project and attract new contributors.\r\n\r\nSee preview: https://github.com/aureleoules/bitcoin/blob/2023-07-update-readme/README.md.",

I don't like the 'vibe' the changes to more informal language creates. It also makes the document less concise. \r\n\r\n- The phrase ```Curious to know more? Find further details``` feels like a pitch almost as compared to the current ```Further information about Bitcoin Core is available```\r\n\r\n- Use of an exclamation point in ```It downloads and validates transactions and blocks in real-time!``` feels forced and again like a pitch. Don't get me wrong I love me some freshie blocks and TXs but...\r\n\r\n- Emojis make this feel like an AI model or application repo see https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT my preference is to have very concise unbiased language and visuals.
