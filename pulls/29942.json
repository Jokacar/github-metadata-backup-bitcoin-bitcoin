    "body": "The `-datacarrier` option is redundant, as disabling the relay and mining of transactions creating OP_RETURN outputs can be accomplished by setting `-datacarriersize=0`. Its removal was supported by several people in the discussion of [#27261](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27261) (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27261#issuecomment-1472404739, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27261#issuecomment-1581058082) and implemented in [#28130](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28130), but that PR was rejected due to making other, more controversial changes.\r\n\r\nBeing a breaking change, this will of course need a release note. I'd recommend anyone concerned that they might accidentally start relaying and mining OP_RETURN transactions to proactively set `-datacarriersize=0` now.",

I'd recommend anyone concerned that they might accidentally start relaying and mining OP_RETURN transactions to proactively set `-datacarriersize=0` now.\r\n\r\nNot sure about saving 4 lines of code for a breaking change. There are other redundant options such as `-signet` and `-chain=signet`, so I don't see why this one should be removed?\r\n\r\n(Edit: I know I changed my opinion on this, compared to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27261#issuecomment-1581058082, but I think it is clear that some users may be using this option and saving a few lines of code may not be worth it in the end, considering this is a breaking change. However, flattening the optional can still be done, because it is not a breaking change and comes with most of the benefits of what this pull is trying to achieve?)",

However, after this pull request, the same is true if `-datacarrier=0` is set in a config file. (See #15021). That is, it is possible that this is silently ignored for a user that has it intentionally set.\r\n\r\n> Here are also a few examples of users confused about the two options:\r\n\r\nIt looks like those are examples of users using the options, so their configs will be broken. If the docs are hard to understand, an alternative would be to improve the docs.\r\n\r\nI am happy to review the optional flattening, if you split it up into another pull request, but this pull request as-is will probably have a hard time finding reviewers.",
