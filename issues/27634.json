The currently implemented one uses a 64-bit nonce and a 64-bit block counter, while the one used in RFC8439 (and thus BIP324) uses a 96-bit nonce and 32-bit block counter. This PR changes the logic to use the 96-bit nonce variant, though in a way that's compatible with >256 GiB output (by automatically incrementing the first 32-bit part of the nonce when the block counter overflows).\r\n\r\nFor those who reviewed the original PR, the biggest change is here that the 96-bit nonce is passed as a Nonce96 type (pair of 32-bit + 64-bit integer) rather than a 12-byte array.\r\n",

However, the RFC8439 authenticated encryption (as used in BIP324, see #27634) scheme makes use of Poly1305 in a way where the message consists of 3 different pieces:\r\n* The additionally authenticated data (AAD), padded to 16 bytes.\r\n* The ciphertext, padded to 16 bytes.\r\n* The length of the AAD and the length of the ciphertext, together another 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nImplementing RFC8439 using the existing `poly1305_auth` function requires creating a temporary copy with all these pieces of data concatenated just for the purpose of computing the tag (the approach used in #25361).\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the poly1305 code with new code from https://github.com/floodyberry/poly1305-donna (with minor adjustments to make it match our coding style and use our utility functions, documented in the commit) which supports incremental operation, and then adds a C++ wrapper interface using std::byte Spans around it, and adds tests that incremental and all-at-once computation match.",

          "title": "net: transport abstraction",
          "body": "This PR furthers the P2P message serialization/deserialization abstraction introduced in #16202 and #16562, in preparation for introducing the BIP324 v2 transport (making this part of #27634). However, nothing in this PR is BIP324-specific, and it contains a number of independently useful improvements.\r\n\r\nThe overall idea is to have a single object in every `CNode` (called `m_transport`) that is responsible for converting sent messages to wire bytes, and for converting received wire bytes back to messages, while having as little as possible knowledge about this conversion process in higher-level net code. To accomplish that, there is an abstract `Transport` class with (currently) a single `V1Transport` implementation.\r\n\r\nStructurally, the above is accomplished by:\r\n* Merging the `TransportDeserializer` and `TransportSerializer` classes into a single `Transport` class, which encompasses both the sending and receiving side. For `V1Transport` these two sides are entirely separate, but this assumption doesn't hold for the BIP324 transport where e.g. the sending encryption key depends on the DH key negotiation data received from the other side. Merging the two means a future `V2Transport` can handle all this interaction without callers needing to be aware.\r\n* Removing the assumption that each message is sent using a computed header followed by (unmodified) data bytes. To achieve that, the sending side of `Transport` mirrors what the receiver side does: callers can set a message to be sent, then ask what bytes must be sent out, and then allowing them to transition to the next message.\r\n* Adding internal locks to protect the sending and receiving state of the `V1Transport` implementation. I believe these aren't strictly needed (opinions welcome) as there is no real way to use `Transport` objects in a multi-threaded fashion without some form of external synchronization (e.g. \"get next bytes to send\" isn't meaningful to call from multiple threads at the same time without mechanism to control the order they'll actually get sent). Still, I feel it's cleaner to make the object responsible for its own consistency (as we definitely do not want the entire object to be under a single external GUARDED_BY, as that'd prevent simultaneous sending and receiving).\r\n* Moving the conversion of messages to bytes on the sending side from `PushMessage` to `SocketSendData`, which is needed to deal with the fact that a transport may not immediately be able to send messages.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a refactor, though some commits are. Among the semantic changes are:\r\n* Changing the send buffer pushback mechanism to trigger based on the memory usage of the buffer rather than the amount of bytes to be sent. This is both closer to the desired behavior, and makes the buffering independent from transport details (which is why it's included here).\r\n* When optimistic send is not applicable, the V1 message checksum calculation now runs in the net thread rather than the message handling thread. I believe that's generally an improvement, as the message handling thread is far more computationally bottlenecked already.\r\n* The checksum calculation now runs under the `CNode::cs_vSend` lock, which does mean no two checksum calculations for messages sent to the same node can run in parallel, even if running in separate threads. Despite that limitation, having the checksum for non-optimistic sends moved in the net thread is still an improvement, I believe.\r\n* Statistics for per-message-type sent bytes are now updated when the bytes are actually handed to the OS rather than in `PushMessage`. This is because the actual serialized sizes aren't known until they've gone through the transport object.\r\n\r\nA fuzz test of the entire `V1Transport` is included. More elaborate rationale for each of the changes can be found in the commit messages.",

It is tested through an extensive fuzz test, which verifies that v2 transports can talk to v2 transports, and v1 transports can talk to v2 transports, and a unit test that exercises a number of unusual scenarios. The transport is functionally complete, including:\r\n* Autodetection of incoming V1 connections.\r\n* Garbage, both sending and receiving.\r\n* Short message type IDs, both sending and receiving.\r\n* Ignore packets (receiving only, but tested in a unit test).\r\n* Session IDs are visible in `getpeerinfo` output (for manual comparison).\r\n\r\nThings that are not included, left for future PRs, are:\r\n* Actually using the v2 transport for connections.\r\n* Support for the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag.\r\n* Retrying downgrade to V1 when attempted outbound V2 connections immediately fail.\r\n* P2P functional and unit tests\r\n",
