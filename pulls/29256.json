    "body": "Improve new LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(),  LogWarning(), LogError() macros introduced in #28318:\r\n\r\n- Make them all accept log categories, to make it possible to filter or highlight log messages from a particular component.\r\n- Make them compatible with wallet logging, which includes the wallet name in log messages.\r\n- Make them not rely on a global LogInstance, to provide better control of logging in controlled environments, such as unit tests that want to selectively capture log output, or libbitcoinkernel applications that want to have multiple instances of validation objects without mixing their log output.\r\n- Make them consistent, now accepting the same parameters.\r\n- Make them less verbose by not requiring BCLog category constants to be specified in individual log prints.\r\n\r\nAn [overview](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/99feed7350b5fc3ae3157dd395ae6260c5bfc092/src/logging.h#L285-L322) of the macros can be found in the logging header.\r\n\r\n### Problems this PR attempts to solve\r\n\r\nThe new log macros in introduced #28318 are generally great. They allow writing code that is succinct and clear, and they remove verbosity and a lot of ambiguity about log levels and categories. Unfortunately, the new macros are *slightly* less general than than needed to be used throughout the codebase. Particularly (1) These macros cannot be used directly in wallet code because wallet log prints are supposed to automatically attach wallet names to log messages. (2) These macros cannot be used at all in libbitcoinkernel code because they do not allow specifying a logger instance. If this PR is rejected, the only alternative approach to solving these problems would be to reimplement these macros outside of the logging framework so they can be used by wallet and validation code. So this PR takes the simple approach of making a small external change to these macros while they are still brand new, so the benefits they bring can be used everywhere.\r\n\r\n### Note to reviewers\r\n\r\n I would encourage first looking at the PR description and actual code changes in this PR to see what it is about (especially looking at changes to the actual log calls in the codebase). It should be possible to come to an independent judgement of this PR, before (or without necessarily) getting into the  discussion history of this PR. Unfortunately and regrettably, I made some dismissive comments on the previous PR, so the discussion here starts out immediately heated. I believe the criticism of this PR is well intended and made in good faith, but it brings up a lot of tangential issues, goes down some paths that are less constructive, and mostly is not focused on the problems this PR is trying to solve, or pointing out any potential harms that would be caused by merging this PR. I would very much welcome and encourage independent review while the other discussion is ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "Replace `LogPrint*` functions with severity based logging functions:\r\n\r\n * `LogInfo(...)`, `LogWarning(...)`, `LogError(...)` for unconditional (uncategorised) logging (replaces `LogPrintf`)\r\n * `LogDebug(CATEGORY, ...)` and `LogTrace(CATEGORY, ...)` for conditional logging (replaces `LogPrint`)\r\n * `LogPrintLevel(CATEGORY, LEVEL, ...)` for when the level isn't known in advance, or a category needs to be added for an info/warning/error log message (mostly unchanged, but rarely needed)\r\n\r\nLogs look roughly as they do now with `LogInfo` not having an `[info]` prefix, and `LogDebug` having a `[cat]` prefix, rather than a `[cat:debug]` prefix. This removes `BCLog::Level::None` entirely -- for `LogFlags::NONE` just use `Level::Info`, for any actual category, use `Level::Debug`.\r\n\r\nAdds docs to developer-notes about when to use which level.\r\n\r\nAdds `-loglevelalways=1` option so that you get `[net:debug]`, `[all:info]`, `[all:warning]` etc, which might be helpful for automated parsing, or just if you like everything to be consistent. Defaults to off to reduce noise in the default config, and to avoid unnecessary changes on upgrades.\r\n\r\nChanges the behaviour of `LogPrintLevel(CATEGORY, BCLog::Level::Info, ...)` to be logged unconditionally, rather than only being an additional optional logging level in addition to trace and debug. Does not change the behaviour of `LogPrintLevel(NONE, Debug, ...)` and `LogPrintLevel(NONE, Trace, ...)` being no-ops.",

      "body": "Hi AJ, this is a draft, and there will be some more changes which may address your concerns.\r\n\r\n> > Make them always accept log categories to make it possible to only log messages from a particular component.\r\n>\r\n> Being able to avoid logging critical messages is adding a bug, not a feature.\r\n\r\nAgree, but the idea here is not to discard log messages, the idea just is to attach meaningful metadata to log messages so they can be filtered by component.\r\n\r\n> > Make them less verbose by not requiring BCLog category constants to be specified in individual log prints\r\n>\r\n> \"+841 -626\" and adding a dummy parameter to most calls does not make things less verbose, and it's also much harder to search for net related logging when the individual log statements just say `m_log` rather than `BCLog::NET`.\r\n\r\nI can probably make the description clearer, but the idea here is that this will make the code less noisy:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-LogPrintLevel(BCLog::NET, BCLog::Level::Warning, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n+LogWarning(log, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is true this sacrifices ability to grep by category constants in the source code, and maybe in your judgement that is an unacceptable cost? But in my opinion, if we ever using same category constants in disparate parts of source code, or different category constants in the same part of the source code, it means source code is badly organized and we should fix that instead of resorting to a coping mechanism of searching for constants instead of searching by source path. In my experience, I've haven't used logging frameworks that have encouraged category constants to be scattered and mixed like this, and I don't think it is a good idea.\r\n\r\nThe \"+841 -626\" refactoring is definitely :hankey:-y and I plan to drop it from this PR. The change to the log macros is meant to facilitate that refactoring, not the other way around. I do think we should stop relying on the global logging instance for libbitcoinkernel code, but probably can keep using it elsewhere.\r\n\r\n> > Make them compatible with wallet logging, which includes the wallet name in log messages\r\n>\r\n> The only thing needed here is renaming from `Printf` to `Info`...\r\n\r\nProbably something is lost in communication here, but the idea is to let wallet code use same LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(), LogWarning(), LogError() macros other code uses. It just adds a little formatting hook so the wallet name is automatically included when the log source is the wallet. This way full functionality of #29256 is available to the wallet and we can drop WalletLogPrintf and not have dedicated wallet logging functions.\r\n\r\n",

This narrowly scoped functionality allows use with v3-like topologies, and will be expanded at some point post-cluster mempool when diagram checks can be done efficiently against bounded cluster sizes.\r\n2) Replacement for single tx RBF(in a cluster size of up to two) against conflicts of up to cluster size two. `ImprovesFeerateDiagram` interface will have to change for this use-case, which is a future direction to solve certain pins and improve mempool incentive compatibility: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/ephemeral-anchors-and-mev/383#diagram-checks-fix-this-3\r\n\r\nAnd longer-term, this would be the proposed way we would compute incentive compatibility for all conflicts, post-cluster mempool.\r\n\r\n",

Ryanofsky [suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1867721948) A `void(KEY)` descriptor which allows for a key to be specified, but produces no scripts. These can be imported into the wallet, and subsequently retrieved with `gethdkeys`. Additionally, `listdescriptors` will output these descriptors so that they can be easily backed up.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it easier for people to add HD keys to their wallet, and to generate a new one if they want to rotate their descriptors, an `addhdkey` RPC is also added. Without arguments, it will generate a new HD key and add it to the wallet via a `void(KEY)` descriptor. If provided a private key, it will construct the descriptor and add it to the wallet.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1866961865\r\n\r\nBased on #29130 as `gethdkeys` is useful for testing this.",

          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. See the original branch for the evolution of the spec.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review? \r\n\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review. Probably starting with ECDH and the Noise Protocol.\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nSilent Payments also needs the ECDH module, so I cherry-picked the commit from #28122. It uses ECDH is a slightly different way, but perhaps there's more overlap to be had.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Upstream issues\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Noise\r\n\r\n- [ ] use EllSwift https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66, implemented in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/28\r\n- [ ] certificate signing issue: https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/717, fix in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/29\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [x] persist static key (needs #29229)\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [x] create `Sv2Transport` subclass similar to `V2Transport`: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/27\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n- [ ] adjust base58 encoding of authority public key https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/721\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [x] hold on to templates a bit after a block is found https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/709 (in case of race to prevent downstream crashes, though we still wouldn't relay it without additional changes)\r\n- [ ] hold on to template transactions even if the mempool drops them (for some time)\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

This could be useful in the future for using or testing these classes without having to instantiate any form of signal handling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587). It improves the kernel API and removes two modules from the kernel library.",

          "body": "This is a follow-up of #28155 motivated by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28155#discussion_r1362677038\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nPrior to this, when establishing a network connection via CConnman::ConnectNode, if the connection needed address resolution, a single address would be picked at random from the resolved addresses and our node would try to connect to it. However, this would lead to the behavior of ConnectNode being unpredictable when the address was resolved to various ips (e.g. the address resolving to IPv4 and IPv6, but we only support one of them).\r\n\r\nThis patches the aforementioned behavior by going over all resolved IPs until a valid one is found or until we\r\nexhaust them.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

It also downgrades `Enqueuing` messages to the `Trace` level.\r\n\r\nIt makes it easier to run for a long time without excessive log file growth. This debug category is particularly useful for keeping track of problematic headers that were seen, the timing of reorgs, see also #27276.\r\n\r\nSince this PR touches `validationinterface.cpp` anyway, it also includes a commit to drop function names from log messages, since we now have `-logsourcelocations`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, though less important, I moved `[validation] Pre-allocating up to position 0x… in rev….dat` messages to blockstorage. This reduces the number of `[validation]` log messages further. ~to 3 per (normal) block.~\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volume of log messages [could also have been reduced](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27277#discussion_r1141375638) by changing the log level of these messages to `trace`. Doing so would prevent a whack-a-mole game of moving log messages to different categories. However in this case I think the change in log category would be justified even if it didn't have a big impact on noise. I.e. someone running with `-debug=mempool` would expect to see the `TransactionAddedToMempool` messages and someone running with `-debug=blockstorage` would perhaps be surprised to not see the `Pre-allocating` message.",

This PR skips flushing to disk those blocks that already have a known position in the datastore. Skipping this means that users can write-protect the `blk` files on disk which may be useful for security or even safely sharing that data between multiple bitcoind instances.\r\n\r\n`FindBlockPos()` may also flush the undo data file, but again this is skipped if the corresponding block position is known, like during the initial stage of a reindex when block data is being indexed. Once the block index is complete the validation mechanism will call `ConnectBlock()` which will save undo data at that time.\r\n\r\nThe call stack looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninit()\r\nThreadImport() <-- process fReindex flag\r\nLoadExternalBlockFile()\r\nAcceptBlock()\r\nSaveBlockToDisk()\r\nFindBlockPos()\r\nFlushBlockFile() <-- unnecessary if block is already on disk\r\n```\r\n\r\nA larger refactor of this part of the code was started by mzumsande here:  https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/tree/202207_refactor_findblockpos including this fix, reviewers can let me know if the changes should be combined.\r\n",

This also has a bit of a performance impact on standard descriptor wallets, although less noticeable due to the small number of SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAs these functions are based on doing `IsMine` for each `ScriptPubKeyMan`, we can improve this performance by caching `IsMine` scriptPubKeys for all descriptors and use that to determine which `ScriptPubKeyMan` to actually use for those things. This cache is used exclusively and we no longer iterate the SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAlso added a benchmark for `IsMine`.",

          "body": "Fixes #27744\r\n\r\nSince #27278 we log received headers. For compact blocks we also log which peer sent it (e5ce8576349d404c466b2f4cab1ca7bf920904b2), but not for regular headers. That required an additional refactor, which this PR provides.\r\n\r\nMove the logging from validation to net_processing.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces the number of log entries (under default configuration) per compact block header from 3 to 2: one for the header and one for the connected tip.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces a new helper method `LogBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a _compact block_ we call `LogBlockHeader` from the exact same place as where we previously logged. So that log message doesn't change. What does change is that we no longer _also_ log from `AcceptBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a regular header(s) message, _we only log the last one_. This is a change in behaviour because it was simpler to implement, but it's probably better anyway. It does mean that if a peer sends of a bunch of headers of which _any_ is invalid, we won't log it (here).\r\n\r\nLastly I expanded the code comment explaining why we log this. It initially only covered selfish mining, but we also care about peers sending us headers but not following up (see e.g. #27626).\r\n\r\nExample log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:21Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:23Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223098 tx=848176824 date='2023-06-05T13:11:49Z' progress=1.000000 cache=6.4MiB(54615txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z Saw new cmpctblock header hash=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223112 tx=848179461 date='2023-06-05T13:13:58Z' progress=1.000000 cache=7.2MiB(61275txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:41Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 peer=8\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:42Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 version=0x2db3c000 log2_work=94.223126 tx=848182944 date='2023-06-05T13:14:35Z' progress=1.000000 cache=8.0MiB(69837txo)\r\n```",

      "body": "> Agree, but the idea here is not to discard log messages, the idea just is to attach meaningful metadata to log messages so they can be filtered by component.\r\n\r\nFiltering is discarding.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to *find* log messages, that what's grep is for, and if you want to make it more fine-grained than \"hey this is an important log message/warning/error\", that's what `-logsourcelocations` is for.\r\n\r\nIf it's any help, I think it's better to think of the sections as not related to which section of the code they appear in so much (again, that's what `-logsourcelocations` is for), but as a subset of the \"debug\" part, in that they let you filter/discard various parts of the full debug log that you would get with `-debug=1`.\r\n \r\n> ```diff\r\n> -LogPrintLevel(BCLog::NET, BCLog::Level::Warning, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n> +LogWarning(log, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nThe current code there is noisy because it uses `LogPrintLevel`. The change you're actually making is:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-LogWarning(\"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n+LogWarning(log, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is adding characters, without adding any information to the reader.\r\n \r\n> It is true this sacrifices ability to grep by category constants in the source code, and maybe in your judgement that is an unacceptable cost?\r\n\r\nI think `LogDebug(BCLog::NET, \"oh no, it all went wrong\\n\")` is better than `LogDebug(m_log, \"oh no, it all went wrong)`. All the characters in the former are doing something useful; `m_log` in the latter isn't (if it weren't for macro magic, we'd write `m_log.Debug(\"...\")` instead, which would be okay at least). I don't think moving the category away from the line of code it's affecting is very useful; and if you want to group all the logs from an individual file together (the way putting `m_log{BCLog::NET}` at the top of the file/class does), then, again, that's what logsourcelocations is for...\r\n\r\n> But in my opinion, if we ever using same category constants in disparate parts of source code, or different category constants in the same part of the source code, it means source code is badly organized and we should fix that instead of resorting to a coping mechanism of searching for constants instead of searching by source path.\r\n\r\nThat's something that already happens: `BCLog::NET` is in timedata and headersync and banman and net and net_processing; `BCLog::VALIDATION` is in validation and validationinterface and flatfile (thought there was a pr to fix that one) and signet; `BCLog::MEMPOOL` is in txmempool, validation and net_processing. It doesn't mean the source code is badly organised, it means different parts of the source are generating related log messages.\r\n\r\n> In my experience, I've haven't used logging frameworks that have encouraged category constants to be scattered and mixed like this, and I don't think it is a good idea.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is anything here \"encouraging\" these categories to be scattered or mixed; most of them are specific to a small set of related files: TOR:torcontrol, HTTP:httpserver, ZMQ:zmq/*, WALLETDB:wallet/*, ESTIMATEFEE:policy/fees.cpp, SELECTCOINS:wallet/coinselection, REINDEX:validation, CMPCTBLOCK:blockencodings, RAND:random.cpp, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd you obviously have worked with code designed this way: that's how `LogPrint` has worked in this codebase since it was implemented in #3009.\r\n\r\n> Probably something is lost in communication here, but the idea is to let wallet code use same LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(), LogWarning(), LogError() macros other code uses.\r\n\r\nUpdating `TraceSqlCallback` to call `LogTrace` rather than `LogPrintf` would be an improvement as those messages would get categorised properly; but otherwise this seems like massive overkill just to avoid writing `\"[%s] ...\", walletname, ...`.\r\n\r\n> It just adds a little formatting hook so the wallet name is automatically included when the log source is the wallet. This way full functionality of #29256 is available to the wallet and we can drop WalletLogPrintf and not have dedicated wallet logging functions.\r\n\r\nA +190 -109 diff because you don't like a one-line wrapper function seems crazy to me.\r\n\r\nDo you have some reason to think there's large amounts of additional wallet debug logs that would be introduced if it didn't involve writing `[%s], walletname` or are there a bunch of the current unconditional `WalletLogPrintf` calls that should be silenced and only available when debugging is enabled?",

      "body": "@ajtowns, to try to steer this discussion in a more constructive direction, would it be possible for you to make a list of the biggest harms you believe this PR would cause if it were merged? And if you have ideas on how the harms you see could be avoided, while the problems I am trying to solve (see \"Problems this PR attempts to solve\" in the PR description) could be addressed, it would be really helpful to know about. Maybe the harms you see this PR causing and the problems this PR is trying to solve are in direct contradiction, but it's not obvious to me that this is the case, so maybe there is a way out of our disagreement here. In the meantime, I responded to your last message below.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29256#issuecomment-1899825975\r\n\r\n> Filtering is discarding.\r\n\r\nIt's really not. You can view logs into a text editor or log viewer and highlight categories of messages you are interested in while not discarding other messages.\r\n\r\nI am just trying to add some basic flexibility here. If you don't want to attach categories to log messages, you don't have to, you can write `LogWarning({}, \"uncategorizable warning\")`. The PR just makes the log macros consistently accept a source parameter, so code has flexibility to set a category, set a log destination, add metadata to log messages, control log formatting, do a combination of these things, or do none of these things.\r\n\r\n> ```diff\r\n> -LogWarning(\"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n> +LogWarning(log, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n> ```\r\n> which is adding characters, without adding any information to the reader.\r\n\r\nThis adds 5 characters, but also adds category information that was previously absent to the output. You can find examples of where the API changes in this PR increase verbosity, and examples where they decrease it, and I think there should be less verbosity on net. I also think some of this discussion around verbosity misses the bigger picture, and is a distraction from the actual goal of the PR, which is to add context to log messages, and give code that needs it control over logging behavior. But if making the log parameter optional is a requirement for you, it should be possible to implement that here and never increase verbosity in any case.\r\n\r\n> All the characters in the former are doing something useful; `m_log` in the latter isn't (if it weren't for macro magic, we'd write `m_log.Debug(\"...\")` instead, which would be okay at least).\r\n\r\nI agree `m_log.Debug(\"...\")` would be better than `LogDebug(m_log, \"...\")` but I don't understand why the former would be ok, but the latter is unacceptable. You definitely have much stronger opinions about verbosity than me, so maybe we can try to engage more constructively on this. I think on net, this PR should reduce verbosity, but maybe more improvements are possible that could alleviate your concerns.\r\n\r\n> I don't think moving the category away from the line of code it's affecting is very useful\r\n\r\nThat's ok, since allowing this was a side effect, not a major goal of this PR. But `LogDebug(m_log, \"debug message\")` can be easier to write and read than `LogDebug(BCLog::TXRECONCILIATION, \"debug message\")`, especially if the code has a lot of log prints and the category is repeated a lot. In any case, you aren't forced to choose one approach or the other. The PR allows both.\r\n\r\n> It doesn't mean the source code is badly organised, it means different parts of the source are generating related log messages.\r\n\r\nOk, we definitely disagree on how well the code is organized. IMO, `validation.cpp` doing `BCLog::MEMPOOL` prints is messed up. But this is a tangent. I think log sources should encourage better organization, but this PR does not force anything or break anything that works now.\r\n\r\n> I don't think there is anything here \"encouraging\" these categories to be scattered or mixed\r\n\r\nI don't want to make a big deal out of this, but just to clarify, I think the status quo where trace and debug macros require `BCLog::LogFlags` arguments and can't take source arguments makes it easier to mix up categories, intentionally and unintentionally. The alternative where source objects can be used for error/warning/info prints, not just debug/trace prints, and can tag everything with the same category should make it easier to be consistent if you want to be consistent (and not get in the way if you don't want to).\r\n\r\n> Updating `TraceSqlCallback` to call `LogTrace` rather than `LogPrintf` would be an improvement as those messages would get categorised properly; but otherwise this seems like massive overkill just to avoid writing `\"[%s] ...\", walletname, ...`.\r\n\r\nI don't see the massive overkill. This is a reasonable PR that adds documentation, tests, and doesn't change very much code. We don't want to require every individual wallet log print to include `\"[%s] ...\", walletname, ...` boilerplate for obvious reasons, I think. The problems with the `WalletLogPrintf` function are:\r\n\r\n1. It is only capable of logging at info level, does not provide a way to log at higher or lower levels.\r\n2. It evaluates its arguments unconditionally, so if it were extended to log at lower levels, it would either be inefficient or need to duplicate preprocessor code from logging.h to be as efficient.\r\n3. It is inconsistent with the rest of the codebase. It is nice if the same logging macros can be used everywhere, and the same features can be used everywhere. It also ensures logging is consistent within the wallet and only one logging API is used there.",

      "body": "> And if you have ideas on how the harms you see could be avoided, while the problems I am trying to solve (see \"Problems this PR attempts to solve\" in the PR description) could be addressed, \r\n\r\nI think the problem you are actually attempting to solve is [\"I, ryanofsky, find this weird and I don't like it\"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28318#discussion_r1450411706), and I don't think code changes are the way of solving that, any more than code changes are the right way to solve the problem \"Bitcoin is weird and I don't like it\". I think you're wrong, but you seem unwilling to consider changing your opinion, so I'm pretty doubtful this is going to be productive. However, in case I'm wrong:\r\n\r\n> These macros cannot be used directly in wallet code because wallet log prints are supposed to automatically attach wallet names to log messages.\r\n\r\nThe only cases where wallet names are automatically attached to log messages are in info level calls, which can be trivially dealt with by changing the existing wrapper to call `LogInfo`, and with an optional scripted diff renaming the wrapper as well.\r\n\r\n> These macros cannot be used at all in libbitcoinkernel code because they do not allow specifying a logger instance. \r\n\r\nThis, also, is not true: the assumption of these macros is that there is a global `BCLog::Logger` instance, which is already provided by `LogInstance()`. If we want to allow apps to configure libbitcoinkernel's logging in future, we could allow them to setup that global instance, or provide their own callbacks for it to use, in much the same way libevent allows you to setup callbacks. That's not something that needs changing.\r\n\r\n> > Filtering is discarding.\r\n> \r\n> It's really not. You can view logs into a text editor or log viewer and highlight categories of messages you are interested in while not discarding other messages.\r\n\r\nThat's not filtering, that's 'grepping'. If you don't want to filter, but just want to highlight, then, as I've said repeatedly, logsourcelocations is what you want; the only benefit categories have compared to that is that categories can be (and by default are) filtered/discarded. logsourcelocations gives you much more exact information, is precisely separated by source file as you want, works with every level of log message, and requires no code changes or ongoing development effort to support.\r\n\r\n> I am just trying to add some basic flexibility here. If you don't want to attach categories to log messages, you don't have to, you can write `LogWarning({}, \"uncategorizable warning\")`.\r\n\r\nIn that case you will not be able to use your log viewer to highlight that message when you're looking for it, which defeats your claimed goal. (Except, of course, you can select it for highlight, by looking for `[warning]` markers)\r\n\r\n> The PR just makes the log macros consistently accept a source parameter,\r\n\r\nCan you please try using the logsourcelocations option before replying again? I really don't see how it doesn't already do everything you want, but you've ignored it every time I've mentioned it.\r\n\r\n> > ```diff\r\n> > -LogWarning(\"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n> > +LogWarning(log, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n> > ```\r\n> > which is adding characters, without adding any information to the reader.\r\n\r\nThe reader of the source code, is who I'm referring to here.\r\n \r\n> > All the characters in the former are doing something useful; `m_log` in the latter isn't (if it weren't for macro magic, we'd write `m_log.Debug(\"...\")` instead, which would be okay at least).\r\n> \r\n> I agree `m_log.Debug(\"...\")` would be better than `LogDebug(m_log, \"...\")`\r\n\r\nI don't think `m_log.Debug()` would be better than `LogDebug` -- in my opinion having a global log instance is the right thing here, and both having multiple references to a global log instance or having multiple log instances that all then coordinate writing to a single log would be worse.\r\n\r\nAs I've already said, I think `m_log.SetCategory(NET); m_log.Debug(\"connected to foo\")` is much worse than `LogDebug(NET, \"connected to foo\")`. Having to keep more context/state in your head when you're looking at code makes things harder, and it tends to make tool use go from \"usually works\" to \"never works\" (eg, `grep -RIl 'Log.*NET'`).\r\n \r\n> > It doesn't mean the source code is badly organised, it means different parts of the source are generating related log messages.\r\n> \r\n> Ok, we definitely disagree on how well the code is organized. IMO, `validation.cpp` doing `BCLog::MEMPOOL` prints is messed up. But this is a tangent. I think log sources should encourage better organization, but this PR does not force anything or break anything that works now.\r\n\r\nvalidation.cpp is where we have the code for \"is this valid for the mempool\", because we thought the word \"valid\" was more important than the word \"mempool\" in that sentence. `BCLog::VALIDATION` on the other hand is limited to blocks and headers, allowing it to be much less noisy than anything that triggers for every transaction, like `BCLog::MEMPOOL`. None of that is any indication of whether the code is well or badly organised.\r\n\r\n> > I don't think there is anything here \"encouraging\" these categories to be scattered or mixed\r\n> \r\n> I don't want to make a big deal out of this, but just to clarify, I think the status quo where trace and debug macros require `BCLog::LogFlags` arguments and can't take source arguments makes it easier to mix up categories, intentionally and unintentionally.\r\n\r\nI think by \"source arguments\" you mean \"a context argument\", and there's no reason they couldn't -- you can write `LogDebug(m_log_category, \"stuff\");` right now just as easily as you could `LogDebug(m_log, \"stuff\");` after this PR. That would still be a bad idea, though, as having the name of the log category obvious in the code is helpful.\r\n \r\n> > Updating `TraceSqlCallback` to call `LogTrace` rather than `LogPrintf` would be an improvement as those messages would get categorised properly; but otherwise this seems like massive overkill just to avoid writing `\"[%s] ...\", walletname, ...`.\r\n> \r\n> I don't see the massive overkill.\r\n\r\nIf there's a way of getting 99% of the benefits with a +1-1 change, then a +300-200 change is overkill in general.\r\n\r\n> This is a reasonable PR that adds documentation, tests, and doesn't change very much code. We don't want to require every individual wallet log print to include `\"[%s] ...\", walletname, ...` boilerplate for obvious reasons, I think. The problems with the `WalletLogPrintf` function are:\r\n> \r\n>     1. It is only capable of logging at info level, does not provide a way to log at higher or lower levels.\r\n\r\nWhy do you think that is a problem? None of the other existing cases need to add walletname boilerplate. What wallet-specific event (if it's not wallet specific, it doesn't need to be tagged with a wallet name) shouldn't be unconditionally logged (if an event is affecting the thing that holds all your funds, isn't that one of the most important things to log)?\r\n\r\n>     2. It evaluates its arguments unconditionally, so if it were extended to log at lower levels, it would either be inefficient or need to duplicate preprocessor code from logging.h to be as efficient.\r\n\r\nThat it only logs at info level means it is unconditionally logged, so all the arguments are naturally unconditionally evaluated.\r\n\r\n>     3. It is inconsistent with the rest of the codebase.\r\n\r\nIt's inconsistent with your idea of how the codebase should be, but it's completely consistent with how the codebase actually is. Which is fine: changing the codebase to match better ideas is how you improve it. But things aren't going to improve if we can't recognise how things actually are in the first place.",
