      "body": "> To me it seems that this could partition the network. In the addresses database of my node there are 2778 addresses that have advertised v2 out of 72821 total.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to respond and consider my feature request.\r\n\r\nI understand your concern about potential network partitioning, but I believe that similar risks exist with other features in Bitcoin as well. While I acknowledge that relying solely on V2 protocol connections may limit the available nodes, I believe it's crucial for those who rely on V2 for verifying the authenticity of connections.\r\n\r\n> For ensuring you really connect to the intended node (avoid MITM) using Tor or I2P may be easier or better alternative. In those networks the address represents the peer's public key and naturally when you establish a connection you know you are talking to the one who possesses the private key which corresponds to the address / public key.\r\n\r\nRegarding your suggestion about using Tor or I2P connections, I appreciate the alternative, but it's important to note that some corporate networks restrict or outright disallow connections over these networks. Additionally, in certain regions, Tor and I2P connections may be filtered out, making it essential to have the option to connect over regular IPV4 and IPV6. In such cases, being able to identify V2 connections can be instrumental.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, while it's true that V2 protocol usage alone does not guarantee protection against MITM attacks, it does provide an additional layer of security, especially for those who require confirmation of a \"bonafide\" node.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I still believe that having the ability to specify V2 protocol connections would be beneficial, particularly in scenarios where other options are restricted or unavailable.\r\n\r\n",

For such a peer, v2 connection would already be established currently. So what is the point of having such an option? To make sure MITM does not interfere with the v2 handshake in order to force v1? In this case, knowing the peer supports v2, is the inability to establish v2 equivalent to having v2 with mismatching session ids, showing that MITM is happening?\r\n\r\nGlobal v2only as described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29618#issuecomment-1994403879\r\n---\r\nConsidering a scenario where a node has clearnet-v1 and clearnet-v2 connections. Do clearnet-v1 connections hurt in any way? Is their presence harmful so that we would want to remove them with a v2only option, other than taking up slots? When picking up automatic outbound peers, we take care to have at least one peer from each of the reachable networks. Should we then insist on having at least one clearnet-v2 connection? In other words, treat ipv4-v1 and ipv4-v2 as separate networks for the purpose of choosing outbound peers?",

I got the impression that the OP is missing the fact that if this particular node supports v2 then a v2 connection will be opened even now.\r\n\r\nYes, I'm aware of this and have started using the appropriate flag for such connections.

Opening v2-only connections for all outbound connections to clearnet peers (for Tor, I2P and CJDNS v1 is as fine because they do encryption anyway).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it would be preferable if the connection couldn't be established when using addnode in certain situations. For instance, if you're in an environment where the default fallback could potentially expose you to security risks, having this control would be invaluable.

Having this option available would offer greater flexibility and security for node operators.\r\n\r\nThank you for bringing up these points, and I appreciate the opportunity to further discuss and refine these ideas.\r\n",

In 27 the global `-v2transport` defaults to `true` and the optional v2 argument to the `addnode` RPC, if not provided, defaults to `-v2transport`.\r\n\r\n> For instance, if you're in an environment where the default fallback could potentially expose you to security risks\r\n\r\nBe careful, it is better not to assume that v2 hides the fact that it is bitcoin traffic going through. That is - that \"you\" are running a bitcoin node. Why is that?\r\n* For automatic outbound connections - your node picks addresses to connect to from a publicly available list of listening bitcoin nodes. So, as soon as your router/ISP/corp/gov/spy sees a TCP connection to an address:port from that list, they know that this is bitcoin traffic, even if they cannot see the traffic itself.\r\n* For manual connections by e.g. `addnode` RPC to another node that is listening but has not announced their address:port publicly to the bitcoin network. The adversary can see the TCP connection from you to that address:port and can try to connect to address:port themselves and figure out that it is a listening bitcoin node.\r\n\r\nOr are you talking about the contents of the traffic itself? There is usually nothing sensitive going through in the p2p traffic. Maybe only if you broadcast your own transactions, is this the \"security risks\" you mentioned?",

Nevertheless, I'm optimistic that as the ecosystem evolves and matures, the concerns surrounding the potential risks of a blanket V2-only option will be addressed.\r\n\r\nI still believe that implementing a V2-only option would be a significant boon for users in less friendly environments where using the V1 protocol could pose serious risks to privacy and security.",

For such a peer, v2 connection would already be established currently. So what is the point of having such an option? To make sure MITM does not interfere with the v2 handshake in order to force v1? In this case, knowing the peer supports v2, is the inability to establish v2 equivalent to having v2 with mismatching session ids, showing that MITM is happening?\r\n\r\nThese type of attacks are most assuredly happening by nation-state actors currently. Having the ability to disable a V1 connection entirely is most assuredly the only way to put a stop to it in some locations.\r\n\r\n> Considering a scenario where a node has clearnet-v1 and clearnet-v2 connections. Do clearnet-v1 connections hurt in any way? Is their presence harmful so that we would want to remove them with a v2only option, other than taking up slots? When picking up automatic outbound peers, we take care to have at least one peer from each of the reachable networks. Should we then insist on having at least one clearnet-v2 connection? In other words, treat ipv4-v1 and ipv4-v2 as separate networks for the purpose of choosing outbound peers?\r\n\r\nGreat questions, I know that insisting on the v2 connection against the networks would be a considerable lift development wise, I think that is a great way to go but I think just having the ability to disable V1 connections entirely is a great start at the moment without the additional heavy lift.\r\n",

If it's decided to proceed with the option, it should be clear to users that it's only clearnet, Tor/I2P would still allow v1, and e.g. using Tor isn't a cure for P2P protection (it really never was, just provides a layer of protection for some attack vectors).\r\n\r\nI'm torn on the implementation of this option. On one hand, providing users with the optionality to enforce v2 transport seems reasonable. On the other hand, even with a large portion of the network supporting v2 transport, if this option ever becomes default ON (IMO it shouldn't) it could effectively force old nodes to upgrade or risk being isolated/partitioned.\r\n\r\n",
