    "title": "bitcoind hangs waiting for `g_requests.empty()`",
    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Current behaviour\r\n\r\nbitcoind hangs \r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nbitcoind shouldn't hang\r\n\r\nI was able to dump the running threads and it was stuck waiting for `g_requests` to be empty. The issue seems to be that this callback may not actually be called in case of error: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/22139f6e83a2bedd2dad9f280567d2c76c54252f/src/httpserver.cpp#L222-L227\r\n\r\nSee this issue https://github.com/libevent/libevent/issues/589 for more details. I think what happens is that interrupting `bitcoin-cli` before it has received the reply calls the error callback and then the success callback is never called.\r\n\r\nI think this is also a memory leak since `g_requests` won't get cleaned up. Whether it's severe or not probably depends on the caller and what type of requests they are making. This new code was introduced here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26742\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI was running a simple shell script in 4 terminal windows for fun:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nfor i in {1..50000}\r\ndo\r\n\t./src/bitcoin-cli -rpcuser=admin -rpcpassword=pass getrawtransaction 217819875434324c412d5e938f7f3c1670fb60814974cf7958f1fac90ee5afb7\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was messing around with this script and randomly Ctrl-C'd each terminal window in rapid succession and then when I waited up to a minute and Ctrl-C'd bitcoind, it didn't shutdown. I can reproduce it pretty reliably as well.\r\n\r\nCompilation commands:\r\n```\r\n./autogen.sh; ./configure --without-wallet --with-gui=no --disable-zmq; make -j4\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun-time options (note that I was able to reproduce this with the default number of rpcthreads as well):\r\n```\r\n./src/bitcoind -txindex -rpcthreads=1 -debug\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput of `gcc --version`:\r\n```\r\nConfigured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.2.1\r\nApple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.62)\r\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin21.6.0\r\nThread model: posix\r\nInstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput of `g++ --version`:\r\n```\r\nConfigured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.2.1\r\nApple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.62)\r\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin21.6.0\r\nThread model: posix\r\nInstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy libevent version is 2.1.12\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n```\r\n^C2023-05-22T20:56:10Z [http] Interrupting HTTP server\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z [rpc] Interrupting HTTP RPC server\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z [rpc] Interrupting RPC\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z tor: Thread interrupt\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z Shutdown: In progress...\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z [rpc] Stopping HTTP RPC server\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z torcontrol thread exit\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z [http] Unregistering HTTP handler for / (exactmatch 1)\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z addcon thread exit\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z [http] Unregistering HTTP handler for /wallet/ (exactmatch 0)\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z [rpc] Stopping RPC\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z net thread exit\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z [rpc] RPC stopped.\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z [http] Stopping HTTP server\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z [http] Waiting for HTTP worker threads to exit\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z [http] Exited http event loop\r\n2023-05-22T20:56:10Z [http] Waiting for 1 requests to stop HTTP server\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe important bit is the very last log line. bitcoind was still alive and periodically printed log lines about feeding dynamic environment data into the RNG.\r\n\r\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\r\n\r\nCompiled from source\r\n\r\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\r\n\r\n17acb2782a66f033238340e4fb81009e7f79e97a\r\n\r\n### Operating system and version\r\n\r\nmacOS intel\r\n\r\n### Machine specifications\r\n\r\n_No response_",

I can confirm that it is fixed by https://github.com/Crypt-iQ/bitcoin/commit/4fd7adb30f584664421b6431bce8ebcbf7ceef2f.\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Details</summary>\r\n\r\nThe test is executed inside a QEMU VM and runs `bitcoind` together with a bunch of client services (like `clightning`, `lnd`, `joinmarket`). It then stops all services, including `bitcoind`.\r\nSometimes `bitcoind` hangs during shutdown:\r\n1. First, it waits for a few minutes at [httpserver.cpp#L469](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v25.0/src/httpserver.cpp#L469) (`[http] Waiting for HTTP worker threads to exit`)\r\n2. Then it hangs indefinitely at [httpserver.cpp#L484](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v25.0/src/httpserver.cpp#L484) (`[http] Waiting for 1 requests to stop HTTP server`')\r\n\r\n`bitcoind` gets shutdown *after* all client services have exited, so there are never any lingering active connections.\r\n\r\nThis bug is hard to reproduce in the context of the test suite.\r\nI once could consistently trigger it on my desktop system, but never again after rebooting the system.\r\nCurrently, I can reproduce it in 80% of all test runs on our [nix-bitcoin server](https://nixbitcoin.org).\r\n\r\n[Here's the log output](https://gist.github.com/erikarvstedt/843f6d5fdb545b52f6bd34bc66651c52) of the shutdown sequence, interspersed with gdb backtraces of all threads.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n",

I have been resynchronizing the blockchain for weeks now and it's about 97% complete so I'm a little paranoid about killing the process. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks\r\n\r\nedit: should also add that prior to trying to quit the application (Bitcoin-QT, btw) it had not processed any new blocks for a few hours.
