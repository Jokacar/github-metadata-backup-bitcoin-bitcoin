    "body": "Have been testing this for a few weeks now - in my experience it helps to avoid moments during IBD where the best chain activation causes download to stop (due to the window being emptied, as no further blocks are being requested while the message handler thread is on hold while waiting for the chain to finish activating) - this becomes especially important with other changes I am testing where the MAX_BLOCKS_IN_FLIGHT_PER_PEER is significantly reduced (based upon bandwidth of each host).\r\n\r\nI might have omitted some locks that need to be used here - and also might be able to incorporate this code into existing files rather than needing new ones - but it is certainly ready enough for a proof of concept I think.\r\n\r\nAlso possible improvements might be to use signals to break out of the sleep (as was done in 351593b9c8687b4da2e86769899b8b61ea44b630), although during IBD I don't think the saving of 100ms is critical.",

Is there any advantage in this blocking?\r\n\r\nUpon further thought, I don't think this is a concern, as this PR only affects during IBD and not when the chain is synced, so the behaviour is the same, but just means that ping times are not affected (as they are currently) and the block download no longer freezes during IBD.\r\n\r\nBut if during IBD you did want to re-inforce behaviour, you could simply postpone responding to getblocks and getheader requests while fActivateChain is true - what would be the benefit in doing this though?",

If this functionality is so important, perhaps a test ought to be added to test for this?",

(CPU load averages in 50% and Bandwidth averages 40Mbps out of 300Mbps available).\r\n\r\nI believe that when a node is doing the first blockchain syncing it needs more outbound connections, for example, 16.\r\n\r\nTo avoid using too many peers and too many resources I propose only increasing  MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS to 16 temporarily when the node is doing its initial syncing and only if port 8333 is open and accepting connections (to encourage nodes to be reachable).\r\n\r\nThis would not harm the network as it would only be during the initial syncing and It would speed up it while encouraging owners to accept incoming connections.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "The application layer is any data that is transmitted within P2P message payloads, and the processing of that data. Examples are tx inventory, addr gossiping, ping/pong processing.\r\n\r\n`CNode` currently contains many data and function members that are concerned with the application layer. These should be moved into net processing, so that `CNode` is only concerned with the network layer (sending/receiving bytes, keeping statistics, eviction logic, etc).\r\n\r\nOne blocker to moving these is that the existing peer data structure in net processing is `CNodeState`, which is guarded by cs_main. Moving all application layer data into `CNodeState` would expand where we need to take and hold cs_main locks. Instead, we should create a new data structure in net processing called `Peer` which doesn't require a cs_main lock, and move the application layer data there.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/2020-06-cnode-comments is a move/comment only branch that re-orders the `CNode` data members into logical groups and adds comments for each member, including TODOs for members that should be moved to net processing. The branch isn't intended for merging, but is a guide for what I think needs to change in `CNode`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/2020-06-cs-main-split is a branch that implements `Peer` and starts moving application layer data into that structure. I intend to peel off commits from that branch into separate PRs. That branch also starts moving data that doesn't require the cs_main lock from `CNodeState` into `Peer`. Longer term, I believe almost all `CNodeState` data can be moved into `Peer`, greatly reducing the scope that cs_main locks are held in net processing.\r\n\r\nAny help reviewing or implementing these changes would be very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nPRs:\r\n\r\n- [x] #19219 Replace automatic bans with discouragement filter\r\n- [x] #19472 Reduce cs_main scope in MaybeDiscourageAndDisconnect()\r\n- [x] #19583 clean up Misbehaving()\r\n- [x] #19607 Add Peer struct for per-peer data in net processing\r\n- [x] #19910 Move peer_map to PeerManager\r\n- [x] #20624 Remove nStartingHeight check from block relay\r\n- [x] #19829 Move block inventory state to net_processing\r\n- [x] #20651 Make p2p recv buffer timeout 20 minutes for all peers\r\n- [x] #20811 Move net_processing implementation details out of header\r\n- [x] #20927 Clean up InactivityCheck()\r\n- [x] #20721 Move ping data to net_processing\r\n- [x] #21187 Only call PushAddress() from net_processing\r\n- [x] #21236 Extract `addr` send functionality into MaybeSendAddr()\r\n- [x] #21186 Move addr data into net_processing\r\n- [x] #21162 Move RelayTransaction() into PeerManager\r\n- [x] #21160 Move tx data into net_processing\r\n\r\n<details><summary><code>CNode</code> with comments.
