    "title": "Libbitcoinkernel Project Tracking",
    "body": "#### Project Board: https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/projects/3\r\n\r\nThis is the tracking issue for the `libbitcoinkernel` project. The original tracking issue is found in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303. This issue contains much of the content written by Carl Dong in the original issue but is more regularly updated.\r\n\r\nThe libbitcoinkernel project is a new attempt at extracting Bitcoin Core's consensus engine. The kernel part of the name highlights one of the key functional differences from the deprecated libbitcoinconsensus and in fact, most libraries: it is a stateful library that can spawn threads, do caching, do I/O, and many other things that one may not normally expect from a library.\r\n\r\nThis statefulness is necessary for libbitcoinkernel's decidedly incremental approach to extracting our consensus engine. This approach favors:\r\n\r\n1. Reusing existing code\r\n...which allows us to be continually integrated with Bitcoin Core and benefit from our extensive test suite\r\n\r\n2. Incremental decoupling instead of building from scratch\r\n ...which allows us to avoid having to prematurely optimize for a \"perfect\" boundary or API (tends to be highly subjective, non-obvious, may lead to unproductive bike-shedding before we've even done anything meaningful)\r\n\r\nThe work of extracting our consensus engine into a library and making the API ergonomic is likely to be a multi-release project involving multiple contributors. The incremental approach takes this into account and respects the sheer size of work (both in writing code and getting it through review) that needs to be undertaken.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\nPlease see the project board: https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/projects/3\r\n\r\n## The Game Plan\r\n\r\n* [ ] Stage 1\r\n    * [x] Step 1\r\n    * [x] Step 2\r\n    * [x] Step 3\r\n    * [ ] Step 4\r\n* [ ] Stage 2\r\n\r\n### Stage 1: Extracting out a usable `libbitcoinkernel.{so,dylib,dll}`\r\n#### Step 1: Introduce internal `bitcoin-chainstate` and `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. What `.cpp` files do we need?\r\n\r\nThis `bitcoin-chainstate` executable uses our consensus engine and its build system code revealed the minimal set of files needed to link in to use the consensus engine as-is. This list of files (the `_SOURCES` in `Automake` speak) then serves as the basis for a `libbitcoinkernel`, which `bitcoin-chainstate` will be linked against.\r\n\r\n**Key Result:** Any further coupling of our consensus engine with non-consensus modules will result in linker errors, preventing this project from becoming a Sisyphean task of battling coupling regressions.\r\n#### Step 2: Decouple most non-consensus code from `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. Prune the unnecessary `.cpp` files (and their respective headers)!\r\n\r\nIn this step many modules were removed from the `libbitcoinkernel` that do not logically belong in `libbitcoinkernel` (e.g. `index/*.cpp`, `netaddress.cpp`), but are nevertheless necessary to be included in its `_SOURCES` for `bitcoin-chainstate` to link correctly.\r\n\r\n**Developer Note:** We do not decouple the mempool _yet_ because most users of `libbitcoinkernel` may want to have an embedded mempool with Bitcoin Core's policies and we can decouple it later. This stage is more about extracting obvious non-kernel functionality, like argument parsing, or shutdown handling, than it is about extracting Bitcoin Core specific functionality like assumevalid, assumeutxo, checkpoints, or the mempool. Such extractions fall under stage 2.\r\n\r\n#### Step 3: Decouple most non-consensus headers from `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. Prune the unnecessary `.h` files!\r\n\r\nThe goal of this step is to allow users of the `libbitcoinkernel` to include its header files without having to include headers of external dependencies, platform-specific definitions, or non-consensus related definitions. A linter enforcing that the headers are not re-added to the header tree should be added.\r\n\r\nA notable piece of this step is removing the `boost` multiindex includes currently required by our mempool headers. Due to their extensive usage between multiple modules, it will take longer to complete and might extend into the second stage.\r\n\r\n#### Step 4: Use the `libbitcoinkernel` library for internal compilation\r\n\r\nNow that `libbitcoinkernel` contains some minimal set of source files, it should also be used as an internal library for `libbitcoin_node`. The desired library organization is shown in [doc/design/libraries.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/libraries.md).\r\n\r\n### Stage 2: Ship an external kernel API \r\n\r\nNow that an internal kernel library with a limited feature set exists, expose it to external users with a C header. Start with a reduced header, exposing just enough functionality to build a utility tool. Ideas for such a utility tool could be a rewrite of bitcoin-chainstate using the C header's API, or a reindexer tool. These tools could also be written in other languages, such as Rust or Python. Care should be taken that the API is as consistent as possible in all respects, manages its own memory to the extent possible, minimizes type conversions between C and C++, and keeps versioning in mind.\r\n\r\n* [ ] Introduce initial C API\r\n* [ ] Add utility using the libbitcoinkernel's C API\r\n* [ ] Add tests exercising the C API\r\n* [ ] Bench performance overhead of going through the C API compared to calling the C++ code directly\r\n* [ ] Add fatal error return codes\r\n\r\nIdeally, users looking to integrate with `libbitcoinkernel` will provide inputs on which library features might be desirable to have exposed. The API will initially have a very idiosyncratic, Bitcoin Core-specific interface. Continual polishing over multiple versions will incrementally make the `libbitcoinkernel` API more ergonomic for users outside of Bitcoin Core. Note though, that there is a possible dichotomy here between optimizing the library interface for external users and for the internal interface within Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nAt this point, we have a usable `libbitcoinkernel` that is _somewhat_ minimally linked. However, it has a very idiosyncratic, Bitcoin Core-specific C++ interface. \r\n\r\n## Getting `libbitcoinkernel` Through Review\r\n\r\nThe project will touch a lot of code that will not have been touched in some time and might resurface older issues. Any outstanding review comments not pertinent to the main thrust of a PR will be taken note of in the TODO section below and then either triaged in an issue or addressed in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n## Action Items\r\n\r\n1. If you have any questions, please post them below!\r\n2. If you have any ideas for the future direction of \"Stage 2: Polishing the API / Continual De-coupling\", please leave a comment below, I'd love to talk!\r\n\r\n## Project-wide TODOs\r\n\r\nThese are suggestions for further cleanup and improvements that came up during review:\r\n\r\n* [ ]  Various followups for [[kernel 2c/n] Introduce `kernel::Context`, encapsulate global init/teardown #25065](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065)\r\n  * [x]  ~Marco's post-merge review comments: [[kernel 2c/n] Introduce `kernel::Context`, encapsulate global init/teardown #25065 (review)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065#pullrequestreview-996614232)~\r\n  * [ ]  Cory's `kernel::Context` cleanup suggestions: [[kernel 2c/n] Introduce `kernel::Context`, encapsulate global init/teardown #25065 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065#discussion_r882182549)\r\n* [ ]  Russell's post-merge review comment: [[kernel 2e/n] miner: Make `mempool` optional, stop constructing temporary empty mempools #25223 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25223#discussion_r898164322)\r\n* [ ]  Various followups for [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487)\r\n  * [x] ~Improve `DumpMempool`'s mutex: [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r916228022).~ Won't fix, see [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r923360777).\r\n  * [ ]  Change `LoadMempool`'s semantics: [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r916044902)\r\n  * [ ]  Make LoadMempool less foot-gunny: [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r921234107), [c4249c1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/c4249c1243981f42091950d1295c2be6bd4bf118)\r\n* [ ] Various followups for [refactor, kernel: Decouple ArgsManager from blockstorage #27125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125)\r\n  * [ ] Martin's request for a follow-up fixing the docstring: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125#discussion_r1190350876\r\n* [ ]  Followups for [kernel: Remove util/system from kernel library, interface_ui from validation #27636](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636)\r\n  * [ ] Cory's request for cleaning up the kernel interface functions of pointer and reference types: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1202937682\r\n  \r\n#### Other various items that arose during review and should be tracked\r\n* Marcos' request for unrolling the reindex loop: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125#discussion_r1183633068\r\n* Marco's request for getting rid of exceptions in the `ArgsManager`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27491#discussion_r1189586654\r\n* Russell's request for eliminating the BlockNotify signal: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1193904693",
