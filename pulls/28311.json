    "body": "This is a (rough draft) clean rewrite of BIP300 (Drivechain) consensus-level code.\r\n\r\nInstead of a separate sidechain database (which may be prone to hard-to-review/test consistency issues), instead the unusable 8 MSB of the UTXO index are reserved for non-UTXO database entries, and the existing UTXO db and caching layer is shared. This can be refactored in the future, but I think it is the cleanest and most reviewable approach initially - open to other ideas, though. There's also some ugliness in the undo data to handle restoring the new data, but it's abstracted and shouldn't be too hard to reason about.\r\n\r\nUsing these new primitives, Drivechains can be reimplemented with a UTXO-like model. Note that there is zero activation logic in the current PR: the protocol changes are *always* active. Therefore, this will *not* work (at least not safely) on Bitcoin today, and cannot be deployed without significant additional changes to handle an activation.\r\n\r\nA new `SERIALIZE_TRANSACTION_FOR_WEIGHT` serialization flag is also added, that is meant only for weight counting. This allows for adjusting weight (upward) to fit additional resource requirements by new functionality. In this case, several Drivechain \"messages\" are expected to have a larger burden than their `OP_RETURN` encoding would otherwise weigh. However, the specific adjustments are not implemented in this draft.\r\n\r\nAs a consensus change, this can only be implemented with community support. Many people seem to have opinions, but please keep them to other forums. Despite providing and continuing this implementation, I myself do not thereby endorse or otherwise comment on the proposal itself.\r\n\r\nTherefore, not looking for concept ACKs/NACKs (ie, about Drivechains), just *Approach* ACKs / constructive criticism (ie, about *how* I'm implementing it).",

Per @luke-jr's [request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28311#issue-1860387785):\r\n\r\n> Many people seem to have opinions, but please keep them to other forums... not looking for concept ACKs/NACKs, just Approach ACKs / constructive criticism.\r\n\r\nIn case this request was missed, or there was a misunderstanding about the request, by \"just Approach ACK / constructive criticism\" Luke is saying he only wants feedback on his specific _approach_ taken to implement BIP300 in this PR. If a reviewer likes this approach, or does not like this approach and can suggest a better approach to implementing the BIP300 spec, then that is the kind of feedback Luke is looking for. On the other hand, if a reviewer has feedback about the _general concept_ of BIP300 then Luke requests that that feedback be shared elsewhere -- may I suggest the [bitcoin-dev](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev) mailing list or the new [Delving Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org) forum?",

          "body": "Since https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17487 we no longer need to clear the coins cache when syncing to disk. A warm coins cache significantly speeds up block connection, and only needs to be fully flushed when nearing the `dbcache` limit.\r\n\r\nFor frequent pruning flushes there's no need to empty the cache and kill connect block speed. However, simply using `Sync` in place of `Flush` actually slows down a pruned full IBD with a high `dbcache` value. This is because as the cache grows, sync takes longer since every coin in the cache is scanned to check if it's dirty. For frequent prune flushes and a large cache this constant scanning starts to really slow IBD down, and just emptying the cache on every prune becomes faster.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we can add two pointers to each cache entry and construct a doubly linked list of dirty entries. We can then only iterate through all dirty entries on each `Sync`, and simply clear the pointers after.\r\n\r\nWith this approach a full IBD with `dbcache=16384` and `prune=550` was 32% faster than master. For default `dbcache=450` speedup was ~9%. All benchmarks were run with `stopatheight=800000`.\r\n\r\n|  | prune | dbcache | time | max RSS | speedup |\r\n|-----------:|----------:|------------:|--------:|-------------:|--------------:|\r\n| master | 550 | 16384 | 8:52:57 | 2,417,464k | - |\r\n| branch | 550 | 16384 | 6:01:00 | 16,216,736k | 32% |\r\n| branch | 550 | 450 | 8:05:08 | 2,818,072k | 8.8% |\r\n| master | 10000 | 5000 | 8:19:59 | 2,962,752k | - |\r\n| branch | 10000 | 5000| 5:56:39 | 6,179,764k | 28.8% |\r\n| master | 0 | 16384 | 4:51:53 | 14,726,408k | - |\r\n| branch | 0 | 16384 | 4:43:11 | 16,526,348k | 2.7% |\r\n| master | 0 | 450 | 7:08:07 | 3,005,892k | - |\r\n| branch | 0 | 450 | 6:57:24 | 3,013,556k |2.6%|\r\n\r\nWhile the 2 pointers add memory to each cache entry, it did not slow down IBD. For non-pruned IBD results were similar for this branch and master. A non-pruned IBD with full `dbcache` to tip ended up using 12% more memory, but it was also 2.7% faster somehow. For smaller `dbcache` values the `dbcache` limit is respected so does not consume more memory, and the potentially more frequent flushes were not significant enough to cause any slowdown.\r\n\r\nInspired by [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15265#issuecomment-457720636).\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11315.",

But in CheckTxInputs, HaveInputs is first invoked, which on its turn calls HaveCoin. HaveCoin is implemented in CCoinsViewDB, but not in CCoinsViewErrorCatcher, and thus the disk read exception escapes.\r\n> A solution may be to just add an override for HaveCoin in CCoinsViewErrorCatcher.\r\n\r\nI implemented `CCoinsViewErrorCatcher::HaveCoin` and also added a periodic disk space check that shutdowns the node if there is not enough space left on disk, the minimum here is 50MB.\r\n\r\nFor reviewers, it's possible to saturate disk space to test the PR by creating large files with `fallocate -l 50G test.bin`",

          "body": "While we are evaluating a package, we split it into \"subpackages\" for evaluation (currently subpackages all have size 1 except the last one). If a subpackage has size 1, we may add a tx to mempool and call `LimitMempoolSize()`, which evicts transactions if the mempool gets full. We handle the case where the just-submitted transaction is evicted immediately, but we don't handle the case in which a transaction from a previous subpackage (either just submitted or already in mempool) is evicted. Mainly, since the coins created by the evicted transaction are cached in `m_view`, we don't realize the UTXO has disappeared until `CheckInputsFromMempoolAndCache` asserts that they exist. Also, the returned `PackageMempoolAcceptResult` reports that the transaction is in mempool even though it isn't anymore.\r\n\r\nFix this by not calling `LimitMempoolSize()` until the very end, and editing the results map with \"mempool full\" if things fall out.\r\n\r\nPointed out by instagibbs in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/faeed687e5cde5e32750d93818dd1d4add837f24 on top of the v3 PR.",

      "body": "@luke-jr @petertodd As someone that can claim to be your technical peer and with experience in consensus development, I would appreciate if you can publish on the communication space of your convenience the contractual commitment excerpts linking your work on drivechain to the proposal authors themselves . The amount and all personal matters are no public business, though at the very least I hope you have minimal provisions protecting the autonomy of your creative work or ensuring the intellectual outcome respect FOSS licenses.\r\n\r\nWith all my respect, I’m not questioning the legitimacy as an independent technical expert who has accumulated years of hard works of being paid to offer a grounded and in-depth technical opinion on a subject in the scope of its competence. Here I’m just asking for transparency on potential conflict of interest that one would request in all walk of life (law, health, energy) when experts are expressing themselves on a complex subject with potential large-scale and serious impact on the end-users (financial) life.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have the competence and knowledge to evaluate the proposal both in code and its associated documentation without relying on “domain experts”, though I think other folks in the community would appreciate the ethical effort. \r\n\r\nI understand it’s delicate as a remark though as Rusty Russell [observed](https://rusty-lightning.medium.com/the-corrosion-of-ethics-in-cryptocurrencies-f7ba77e9dfc3) a while back in matters of open-source cryptocurrency development ethics, we’re keeping each other in check as peers. I’ve been in the same situation early last year when I’ve been approached to do a paid security review of the CTV soft-fork and I politely declined. My professional policy for years have been to decline any work commitment related to consensus changes to preserve the independence of my views.\r\n\r\nIf you would like feedback on how to construct ethically and legally such agreement, I’m staying available out of band to provide my viewpoint and relevant information. I don’t think the discussion is appropriate for the GH repository. I’m staying available to discuss the ethics and ideal development process of consensus changes on the mailing list or other forum of discussions. As a community, I think we’re still paying the trauma of a group of Bitcoin dev experts raising millions in VC-funding almost a decade ago to promise new technology and corresponding consensus changes and finding themselves in a massive situation of conflict of interests with the rest of the ecosystem, whatever the great achievements they have realized on a lot of significant fronts.",

      "body": "> This is a (rough draft) clean rewrite of BIP300 (Drivechain) consensus-level code.\r\n> \r\n> Instead of a separate sidechain database (which may be prone to hard-to-review/test consistency issues), instead the unusable 8 MSB of the UTXO index are reserved for non-UTXO database entries, and the existing UTXO db and caching layer is shared. This can be refactored in the future, but I think it is the cleanest and most reviewable approach initially - open to other ideas, though. There's also some ugliness in the undo data to handle restoring the new data, but it's abstracted and shouldn't be too hard to reason about.\r\n> \r\n> Using these new primitives, Drivechains can be reimplemented with a UTXO-like model. Note that there is zero activation logic in the current PR: the protocol changes are _always_ active. Therefore, this will _not_ work (at least not safely) on Bitcoin today, and cannot be deployed without significant additional changes to handle an activation.\r\n> \r\n> A new `SERIALIZE_TRANSACTION_FOR_WEIGHT` serialization flag is also added, that is meant only for weight counting. This allows for adjusting weight (upward) to fit additional resource requirements by new functionality. In this case, several Drivechain \"messages\" are expected to have a larger burden than their `OP_RETURN` encoding would otherwise weigh. However, the specific adjustments are not implemented in this draft.\r\n> \r\n> As a consensus change, this can only be implemented with community support. Many people seem to have opinions, but please keep them to other forums. Despite providing and continuing this implementation, I myself do not thereby endorse or otherwise comment on the proposal itself.\r\n> \r\n> Therefore, not looking for concept ACKs/NACKs (ie, about Drivechains), just _Approach_ ACKs / constructive criticism (ie, about _how_ I'm implementing it).\r\n\r\nNACK, concept, approach, all. IMV Bitcoin is NOT made for the BIP/PR mania, Core Devs profit absolutely from. Any Core Devs, are by definition, not the ones to decide anything due to lack of exemption as service providers in Bitcoin, not unbiased customers/node operators(the only unbiased who must decide about their OWN property). It is for long been that Devs keep pushing node operators out of the decisions that belong solely to them as owners of Bitcoin, NOT to Devs, NOT to miners. Instead of coding every time an OPTION in full nodes software to allow (UN)SUPPORT for each non-stop new BIP/PR mania non-bug fixing CHANGE to Bitcoin, they discretely discuss things in a 'only for the experts central Hub' environment, like this one in GitHub and less user friendly, MS-DOS/command prompt like and as geeky as possible, JUST LIKE ALTCOINERS DID when inventing a lot of weird new jargon for things that always existed, so that all the idiots could eat their very shady technical jargon in speculative marvel and fiat dollar signs in their eyes.",

      "body": "@psztorc\r\n\r\n> This area is for discussing the Approach/Implementation. Everything else is off-topic.\r\n\r\nThere is an uncertainty on the open-source status of the technical contributions due to the apparent mode of financial compensation of the \"champions\" developers, among other issues. While this might be acceptable for a lot of contributions in other areas of the Bitcoin ecosystem, here we're talking about consensus changes in a $500B ecosystem, any exposure due to uncertain license on key components might taint the rest of the open-source Bitcoin software. I think we've already enough issues with CSW lawsuits from now on to minimize the legal exposure of all ecosystem stakeholders, in my reasonable opinion.\r\n\r\nThis type of discussion happens, among other forums, on the Github repository. E.g #28175.\r\n\r\n> Any skeptics or opponents of DC should at least pretend to want to see a real implementation, before dismissing it. After all, pre-implementation the idea is inherently unfinished.\r\n\r\nI've never seen any Bitcoin Core commit or substantial review on delicate critical components realized under your pseudonym, or even substantial technical contributions on deployed and with real-world usage multi-party applications or contracting protocols (e.g payment channels), so I don't know your level of understanding of the Bitcoin network, protocols architecture and ecosystem. Even when an idea is fully fleshed out in code and once it deployed you have unmeasurable security, safety and compatibility maintenance costs beared by the whole ecosystem ad vitam aeternam (i.e\r\nas long as Bitcoin is around for the next decaces/centuries hopefully). Additionally, it also increases the development cost on all the affected Bitcoin systems: miner stack, mempool and transaction-relay, lightning, vaults, data carriage cost as investigating for the lack or the finding of potentially harmful interactions due to modified miner incentives is a very high technical bar.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't have strong technical opinion on DC / sidechains, as with any complex technical matter this is far from being a \"binary\" subject. All I know is we're Aug 30 (depending your timezone) and there is far enough hard technical issues to review and test for the coming year (package relay, assumeutxo, libitcoinkernel, bip324, _maybe maybe_ APO, transaction-relay policy improvement for data carriage usage). Speaking for myself and myself only, this is not worthy to allocate high-caliber technical review time (in a pure FOSS fashion without financial compensation to preserve independence of my judgement) on a consensus changes project with that level of uncertainty in its development process, at the very least until next year Aug 30 2024. By then, I hope project champions will have clarified the development and technical evaluation process of DC.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss in depth the ethics of Bitcoin consensus changes, what lessons can be sketched out from the failed activation of CTV by its champion Jeremy Rubin last year or the best development practices of critical Bitcoin components, I'm staying available to discuss it during in person at a panel or another public format at a Bitcoin conference during the coming years.",

In future mining will be done for a big part by pools.\r\nCreating drivechains and give them the possibility to create their own chain, pegged on the mainchain,\r\ncan create huge legal implications.  Pools can also ask contributing miners to cooperate, give them a reward\r\non their sidechain but hodl the bitcoin for themselves.  Then about voting.  A minority of them can just push changes\r\nthrough on their chain.  This is pretty much centralisation.\r\n\r\nYou are clearly affiliated with RogerVer having bitcoincash.

Refering to this can be translated as, look I donated in the defensive\r\ncase against faketoshi CSW.\r\n\r\nWe all know that Craig Wright does hoax.  Clearly not Satoshi Nakamoto, because he lacks not only the technical skills but also he has NO SINGLE private key related to the genesisblock (block 0), block 1 and not even the PGP key.  \r\nSigning is key.  And he has for sure not the mentality of an open source developer...\r\n\r\nIt was very generous of You to help that teacher in the trails seen he was clearly bullied by CSW who's intention is clearly to grab income from legal pursuits, while the same time he seems not to pay his lawyers or when he loses his case.\r\nThat all is possible in the UK, maybe the USA, but I want to see that happen in West-Europe...\r\n\r\nBut that does not mean You can push through, imo, a pretty dirty hack to centralise bitcoin, to peg on the blockchain and to leak away bitcoin in a sidechain.\r\n\r\nThat is like to use a cherry trunk, branch other fruit on it...when the fruit is rotten or the branch is rot....cut.\r\nAnd those on the branch end up with a trash reward...\r\n\r\nEveryone can fork bitcoin and create their own altcoin.  But to create drivechains, to have indirectly an altcoin,\r\nown rules, own power, own votes, piggy backing on bitcoin...until there is a huge issue and they will all claim. it's bitcoin core that made the error.... I am totally against that idea\r\n\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > Speaking for myself and myself only, this is not worthy to allocate high-caliber technical review time\r\n> \r\n> Why not speak openly, of whatever is really on your mind? Clearly we don't expect a review from every single person on Earth -- as you must know. So either say whatever it is you want to say, or go back to reviewing whatever you think is important.\r\n\r\nFirst **Stratum** improvement....  \r\n\r\nBTW why all those people like You want always change things and 'improve' things?!  Currently bitcoin is safe, robust and all those new idea's clearly not well thought through, experimental, **unsafe** like Peter Todd said, we can miss this totally.\r\n\r\nPersonally I also see this as a very dangerous way to ruin bitcoin.  I explain in detail.\r\n\r\nAnd I quote Satoshi (whatever you think about this claim, and it's not CSW)\r\n\r\n_They can create a #drivechain, convince, force (by law) people to move their bitcoin to the sidechain.  Now their terms.  That's like creating fiat backed by gold so to speak, an altcoin or CBDC.  Then force people by law or defacto to use theirs ?!_\r\n\r\nBTW You did block that account on twitter, i hope there will be no digital sign or You will look like a...,  including a big amount of people inside the bitcoin  community. You push like a merchant with full force propaganda your idea...\r\nMany did state already...this is stinky.\r\n\r\nSo is your purpose to leak out bitcoin to a sidechain to finally have your own terms, control, tracking, whatever?\r\nThis is IMO a major attack (again) on bitcoin just like the blocksize war was, reason Satoshi did revoke his repo key at that time, if nobody did notice.\r\n\r\nI warn you personnally, if bitcoin is again attacked in such way, some will not deal with the ridiculous claims of\r\nCraig Wright but You will have your answer in text SIGNED with the genesis block. And when this need to happen,\r\nyou and those people should provide a huge budget to defend their case because the whale wallet of the early blocks is pretty useful in such case to defend bitcoin.\r\n\r\n**Bitcoin is not to hijack for commercial reasons**, to soft or hard fork in a centralised solution **to finally leak out bitcoin** to an alternative form of an altcoin, but now on a drivechain.\r\n\r\nThanks for your proposal but my vote is, as you know, **NACK** including the one of Ace of Bitcoin You did block btw.\r\n\r\nBtw when You mine have a full node... **`bitcoin-cli -generate 1 2147483647`**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@psztorc \r\n\r\n> Not to me. The source code is in the pull request.\r\n\r\nPublishing the code is in the open does not minimize intellectual property hostile claims towards the project in the future. Whatever one think about the philosophical legitimacy of patent and intellectual property, especially in the Internet world, under US patent law, software _might_ sadly be eligible_ to patent protection. If this consensus change and the corresponding source code has been funded by incorporated entities they can very claim resulting licensing to enter into their corporate assets, and from then make a lot of claims. I don’t assume hostile intentions, though in case of future dispute with shareholders in this DC project, it’s hard to predict what can happen.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, I think a reasonable and ethical practice could be for any affiliated corporate entity sponsoring the project to pledge any intellectual rights arising from DC development to be pledged in an open patent organization, e.g https://www.opencrypto.org/about/\r\n\r\n> You are referring to disclosed financial compensation, only. But everyone here may have undisclosed financial\r\n> compensation, including [you](https://blog.okcoin.com/okcoin-bitcoin-developer-grant-antoine-riard/). Plus, we all own\r\n> different amounts of Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n_Undisclosed_ financial compensation is the ethical issue at stake. If you’re have or expect financial compensation (equity valuation or capital investment) from the successful deployment of DC (which might have technical and economics risks on the stability of the Bitcoin network and therefore the value of the coins themselves), I think you're in a situation of _conflict of interests_ with all the _passive_ intelligent Bitcoin investors, of which the financial portfolio strategy can be to wait a slow appreciation of their Bitcoin digital assets. Without playing wizardry with the fundamentals of the system.\r\n\r\nOn the past okcoin funding grant, this contract framework explicitly includes a provision of technical autonomy in the area of Bitcoin consensus changes, on the model of Bitmex bitcoin developer grant agreement (cf. 2.2): https://github.com/jonathanbier/Bitcoin-Developer-Grant-Agreement/blob/master/Bitcoin-Developer-Grant-Agreement.md \r\nThough I can take opportunity to say, in matters of technical neutrality open-source funding, from the viewpoint of a developer I can only recommend to work with the set of historical people I’ve been collaborating with at okcoin as part of their open-source funding program. From my knowledge some historical developers at Blockstream had a similar legal provision of autonomy in their employment agreement.\r\n\r\nEthics and integrity of scientific research are quite well understood in established scientific and software engineering practice. The IETF has rules on [conflict of interests](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/policies-procedures/conflict-interest/), the NASA has guidelines for promoting [scientific and research integrity](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_guidelines_for_promoting_scientific_and_research_integrity-july_2018.pdf) and the ACM has a pretty well-reasoned [code of ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics).  Of course ethics is evolutionary, and there is always a sense of proportion and contextualization to keep.\r\n\r\n> The appropriate way to handle such un-resolv-able issues, is to discuss the idea on its merits only.\r\n\r\nI think this is a hard issue where we’re diverging. While those issues are \"un-resolv-able” (“Men are not angels” - James Madison iirc), though it doesn’t mean principles and ethics have nevertheless been developed and nurtured by technical and scientific communities all around the world, as decades of history is showing it (cf. examples above).\r\n\r\nDiscussing in depth an idea as complex as a Bitcoin consensus changes related to miners incentives would consume hundreds of hours of review time, if you have high-caliber technical eyes and you do not wish to give a simple “binary” answer. A displayed low-level of ethics by a technical idea propoent is not appealing and it appears as a hint of a potential waste of time, when such open-source time could be invested in the review of other sensible technical projects such as package relay, bip324 or libbitcoinkernel.\r\n\r\n> FYI I personally donated thousands of $ to fight such lawsuits, some of which provably so -- in public at Bitcoin events.\r\n\r\nI think this is appreciated by the community and you have my own thanks for it, sincerely. I’m not defendant on the CSW lawsuits (at least for now - fingers crossed) though from my looking on the database rights case this is crazy how someone can make such dubious claims on weak materials. And this is a reason of concern from my point above establishing clear open-source and no-patent/defensive patent status of all technical contributions on critical areas like consensus changes.\r\n\r\nAnd as it sounds you have been in Bitcoin since a while, I think you also remember the [ASICBOOST scandal](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/breaking-down-bitcoins-asicboost-scandal-solutions), and related issues about patent.\r\n\r\n> Why not speak openly, of whatever is really on your mind? Clearly we don't expect a review from every single person on\r\n> Earth -- as you must know. So either say whatever it is you want to say, or go back to reviewing whatever you think is\r\n> important.\r\n \r\nI would appreciate a more respectful tone from someone (to the best of my knowledge) who has never contributed a line of cpp or find a noteworthy bug in the sensible areas of Bitcoin Core, or equivalent full-node software so far.\r\n\r\nTo speak my mind, I think this will be more efficient in term of review, testing and quality assurance of the proposed consensus changes to have this BIP300 PR be opened in bitcoin-inquisition fork: https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/wiki Bitcoin inquisition purpose as a community R&D platform has been discussed here: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020921.html\r\n\r\nAdditionally, about reviewing Bitcoin consensus changes in 2023, I think this is pointless to review only the consensus primitives changes, without proof-of-concept on associated application software (at least an experimental side-chain, wallet, nodes) to enable giving a judgement on the whole end-to-end usage. Such end-to-end technical bar is at least experimentally followed for APO: https://github.com/instagibbs/lightning/commits/eltoo_support\r\n\r\nBeyond on the ethics of Bitcoin consensus changes, and a wish in the community to have a flat development from centralized companies and their own time agenda ensuring we “give a chance and time” to maybe-not-every-single-person -on-Earth though to as much people has we can to have their say on a consensus change, I think it has been discussed here: \r\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-August/020819.html\r\n\r\nAll that said, I’m maintaining that personally I won’t have time to review proposed DC consensus changes before August 2024 as doing it correctly would take at least 3 months of intense review work, and I think this is quite invariant for any skilled Bitcoin reviewers I know. From my appreciation, there has been a trend to have a more public list (package relay / bip324 / libbitcoinkernel) of shared technical priorities in Bitcoin Core and an aim to follow them. I think this is a waste of time and the door towards _real_ ossification of the protocol if skilled technical eyes have to interrupt their monthly-long review cycle every time someone shows up with a consensus change idea, neither build serenity of conservations.\r\n\r\nMy invitation to discuss in person about the topic of Bitcoin consensus change at a conference during the coming years stays open, or on the mailing list if it’s a communication medium you think it’s better suited. I won’t have time to comment or reply further on this PR at least until December of this year.",

And this is a reason of concern from my point above establishing clear open-source and no-patent/defensive patent status of all technical contributions on critical areas like consensus changes.\r\n> \r\n> And as it sounds you have been in Bitcoin since a while, I think you also remember the [ASICBOOST scandal](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/breaking-down-bitcoins-asicboost-scandal-solutions), and related issues about patent.\r\n> \r\n> > Why not speak openly, of whatever is really on your mind?

Such end-to-end technical bar is at least experimentally followed for APO: https://github.com/instagibbs/lightning/commits/eltoo_support\r\n> \r\n> Beyond on the ethics of Bitcoin consensus changes, and a wish in the community to have a flat development from centralized companies and their own time agenda ensuring we “give a chance and time” to maybe-not-every-single-person -on-Earth though to as much people has we can to have their say on a consensus change, I think it has been discussed here: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-August/020819.html\r\n> \r\n> All that said, I’m maintaining that personally I won’t have time to review proposed DC consensus changes before August 2024 as doing it correctly would take at least 3 months of intense review work, and I think this is quite invariant for any skilled Bitcoin reviewers I know. From my appreciation, there has been a trend to have a more public list (package relay / bip324 / libbitcoinkernel) of shared technical priorities in Bitcoin Core and an aim to follow them. I think this is a waste of time and the door towards _real_ ossification of the protocol if skilled technical eyes have to interrupt their monthly-long review cycle every time someone shows up with a consensus change idea, neither build serenity of conservations.\r\n> \r\n> My invitation to discuss in person about the topic of Bitcoin consensus change at a conference during the coming years stays open, or on the mailing list if it’s a communication medium you think it’s better suited. I won’t have time to comment or reply further on this PR at least until December of this year.\r\n\r\nAlthough I agree with at least half of what you are saying namely against this IMV insane BIP300, you have my aplause in that part, you are though also still a Dev, also implicitly in permanent conflict of interests, together with miners, as both groups are service providers for Bitcoin(ers). The only ones to decide ANYTHING about their own property, ARE bitcoiners, by operating their own full node, BUT are being for long pushed away from that role/vote by a CENTRAL HUB of Core Devs, using shady/techy/nerdy platforms such as this one (GitHub) where most bitcoiners do not log to discuss or get awareness of what Devs are conspiring next. For example, with the BIP9 and BIP8 scandalous attack to Bitcoin, known as 'SPEEDY TRIAL' (a CATAPULT for many other BIP mania to start being FORCEFED to Bitcoiners without their decision (as it seems for example doing BIP119 - covenants, using such GATE for BIP mania EXPLOITS) taking decisions away from Bitcoin owners, into service providers instead🤡🤡🤡. It is like if a company, thru their board of directors, decided to hand their strategic decisions to suppliers 🤡 🤡🤡Hello! Adding more op_codes create a 'world computer' like altcoin. That is NOT what Bitcoin is about...! In order to have value its scope must be kept tyranically (Satoshi's term) TINY. Bitcoin is about THE LEAST op_codes possible just enough to address its TINY SCOPE. THAT IS IT. Still altcoiners in Bitcoin, self-entitled bitcoiners, cannot get this after so many years of Devs brainwashing them, as if there was ANY need for continuous non-bug fixing BIP mania. So, definetely, NOT more and more op_codes promoted by the BIP mania, which is profitable only for Devs projects, but in detriment of Bitcoin, by turning it into an altcoin, filled up with unneeded op_code complexity, 'world computer' alike of another altcoin, full of wonderful 'features', which ARE NEITHER TO BE ACHIEVED ON-CHAIN, neither we lack of enough ALTCOIN examples WHICH DID EXACTLY THAT. Devs can only become an exempt role, when only about coding either bug-fixes paid by companies using Bitcoin, and coding MORE OPTIONS in full nodes software to let node operators themselves DECIDE, by (UN)support, WHAT IS CORE=CONSENSUS and what it is not. BUT NEVER service providers, who took over dictatorily UNTIL TODAY such decision role, as currently is still the case in Bitcoin. That is NOT DECENTRALIZATION.",

Whatever one think about the philosophical legitimacy of patent and intellectual property, especially in the Internet world, under US patent law, software _might_ sadly be eligible_ to patent protection. If this consensus change and the corresponding source code has been funded by incorporated entities they can very claim resulting licensing to enter into their corporate assets, and from then make a lot of claims.

If you’re have or expect financial compensation (equity valuation or capital investment) from the successful deployment of DC (which might have technical and economics risks on the stability of the Bitcoin network and therefore the value of the coins themselves), I think you're in a situation of _conflict of interests_ with all the _passive_ intelligent Bitcoin investors, of which the financial portfolio strategy can be to wait a slow appreciation of their Bitcoin digital assets.

      "body": "Thank you for the proposed BIP on drivechains. I have some concerns regarding the approach:\r\n\r\n1. Coins held in hashrate escrow might become enticing for miners as time progresses.\r\n2. Over time, users could develop a misplaced confidence when seeing drive chain coins in BTC denomination. Any coin losses might prompt calls for forks, with users naturally wanting to recover their funds.\r\n\r\nA potentially more robust solution could be inspired by the demurrage concept from @petertodd. Consider incorporating an escrow fee of 0.01% per day (144 blocks) into the coinbase, possibly emulated as a transaction self-spent with FLOOR(satoshis / 10000). This could ensure:\r\n\r\n- A consistent income stream for miners, enhancing the coinbase indefinitely without favoring individual miners.\r\n- Managed user expectations, promoting chain utility and transaction volume. A reduced market cap on the chain could also yield a more game-theoretically stable environment. Moreover, users might be inclined to transact with their coins on the sidechain and regard L1 as a secure value store.\r\n\r\nJust a suggestion. Appreciate the work being done here!",

I will check out the bitcoin for dummies book you recommend though thank you for the tip.\r\n\r\nYes the zero block has indeed a key assigned to it.  It is actually possible to digital sign messages with block 0\r\naka the genesis block.\r\n\r\nThe genesis block is not generated with bitcoind, it is generated with my own scripts.\r\n\r\nSo far Your excellent knowledge in the field.\r\n\r\nI will really close this debate.\r\n\r\nBut I warn people.  Some do know I am on twitter using the same handle.\r\nI was forced to do 'something' when Gavin want to make the blocksize larger with his 'BitcoinXT\r\nLater on I saw he blindly belief a hoaxer who could not even digital sign, however that hoaxer\r\ndid follow me on IRC, ICQ at that time and to get rid of him, I gave him an empty wallet.\r\nThat is the reason he could also inform some inside information.\r\n\r\nI warned that person, if he keeps to attack the Bitcoin Core Dev and if COOPA fails,\r\nhe will deal with me personally.  I do not bluff when I state I have the private keys of the \r\nGenesis (Yes Block 0) and (Block 1) and Yes, the private key of PGP key  0x18C09E865EC948A1\r\nAnd I have 20 keys more, I have keys since 1997\r\n\r\nI told many times , my native language is not English, most of my communication was reviewed\r\nmy  Hal and some others who could speak perfectly British English.  The fact I am not from the UK,\r\nYou can find out I gave in bitcointalk an example using the currency 'euro'  and I used the German\r\nMailbox service.  Most mail to Hal was signed with PGP and I did use Mutt to strip headers.\r\nI used a chain of openproxies and tor to hide my IP and a anon mailforwarder.   I did buy bitcoin.org\r\nwith a very specific method as well I will not disclose...But Sirius knows what I talk about probably.\r\nI can not disclose too much inside information, because I do not want to arm my hoaxer to have more\r\ninfo to attack the project.  But I can say those keywords already mountainbike and poker.\r\n\r\nBesides this I warn that hoaxer, scammer Craig Wright again.  Before I did distribute the whitepaper,\r\nI used the technique many software writers do in my country.  They go to the notary office.  They give\r\na sealed envelope.  That content is unknown to the notary office.  Inside there are papers and a DVD.\r\nThat depot is legally made and registered and that stays in the vaults of the notary.  Only a judge can\r\nopen this to check content or of course it is void if someone else does.  Inside that envelope is my\r\nwhitepaper bitcoin.pdf...The original version before I did distribute it... Additionally Sato Shi Naka Moto\r\nare indeed 4 words in Japanse language with a meaning to explain that the real insight, wisdom is in\r\nanyones heart (center)  it is based a variation of a caeserian cypher I made from my firstname, middlename of my grandfather and my family name.  And finally, where all of you think there are some random bits here and there,\r\nwhen creating the genesisblock I did inject encrypted my name.  Actually that was Hal's idea because we did cooperate pretty close.  But I say this again.  Craig Wright will never, never sign with the genesisblock (block 0) and block 1.\r\nAnd if CSW reads this well, in ICQ/IRC chat we did talk about Freud and why I had totally no intention to come forward and claim (what Craig did suggest) the noble price.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is a decentralised project.  That is the reason the blocksize need to be minimal.  So everyone can be a fullnode.\r\nI am totally against that miners are not full nodes.  I do not agree either with the fact setgenerate was removed in version 0.13.... And I do not agree at all the ideas in BIP300.  Sidechaining can be an option but that option takes\r\na lot of preparion and study.  You simply can't run broken code or make decisions that mining becomes centralised.\r\n\r\nMany who did mine became rich, wealthy because of the use of GPU and later on ASIC.  I did mine only temporary\r\nusing CPU and actually Hal did mine faster as I did seen he used a mainframe...  Later on Hal shared bitcoin with me\r\nsimply transfering the wallets with IRC...\r\n\r\nBut I say this.  The project is centralised.  Belief what You want about me.  If I had a choice I would not be here to talk, neither I would done something 10 years ago so the community could wake up.\r\n\r\nBut the legal game of CSW will fail.  But if I see the code, protocol of bitcoin changes in that way, I see centralisation, greed, whatever or safety issues and this is pushed through, I will act.  Then I will if needed digital sign, proof without doubt that I am the one and I FORK the project.\r\n\r\nYou all forget I have also a whale wallet, I currently use to stabilize bitcoin so to speak like a keel of a ship.  \r\nThe purpose of this wallet is to put later on mostly in a foundation to support free speech, innovation and so on.\r\nBecause I do not need fame, I do not need to drive a lambo.  I did realise with Hal and others of You, bitcoin. \r\nThat is my life project and much more valuable than all the money in the world.  You can not tame the Mammon\r\n(god of money) if you are the slave of it...  Some people have higher goals in their lives...\r\n\r\nDon't mess up bitcoin.  That's all I ask.  You may mock me as much you want.  Tell people I speak crappy English,\r\nbut I code since I was 12, I did generate the genesisblock, I am the keyholder and sorry, but I am Satoshi Nakamoto.\r\nSorry I disappoint some of You.  I am not from the USA, the UK, Japan...I am not AI or part of the secret services.\r\n\r\nI am only a coder with a vision to bring the best to this world full of greed, exploitation and lies.  Especially\r\nwhen it is related to fiat money what needs to be pure after all and not manipulated by printing it behind the back\r\nof people to steal their purchasing power or actually their energy they did put into society...\r\n\r\nThanks for all those people who did contribute on the project.  Stay pure.\r\n\r\nSatoshin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the Best,",

And if there are multiple deposits in a block then each deposit after the first one must spend the previous unconfirmed CTIP in order to be accepted.\r\n\r\nIf the fee rate required to be included in a block is higher than the minimum fee to be included in miner mempools, this seems to open the door for \"freeloaders\" who pay the minimum fee to be included in the mempool, hoping to be subsidised by subsequent depositors within the same block - as subsequent depositors are forced to spend the freeloader's unconfirmed CTIP in order to be accepted into mempools. This seems like it could result in a bad user experience.\r\n\r\nIs it not possible to make it so that deposits do not have to spend the CTIP, but rather make an additional output to the sidechain address? Then, when a block is mined, there can be a different rule where the miner is forced to make a consolidation transaction merging all the sidechain UTXOs into one. So essentially, the \"only one CTIP allowed\" rule is only checked based on the final state once all transactions in the block are accounted for.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how this would affect the overall size of the deposits, but it seems that it would be minimal. There'd be 1 more transaction, 1 more input and 1 more output in total compared to the current method. We could also allow both methods of depositing and users can choose based on the circumstances.",
