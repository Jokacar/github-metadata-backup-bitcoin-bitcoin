          "body": "The `PopulateAndValidateSnapshot` function introduced in f6e2da5fb7c6406c37612c838c998078ea8d2252 from #19806 has been setting fake `nTx` and `nChainTx` values that can show up in RPC results (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29328) and make `CBlockIndex` state hard to reason about, because it is difficult to know whether the values are real or fake.\r\n\r\nRevert to previous behavior of setting `nTx` and `nChainTx` to 0 when the values are unknown, instead of faking them. Also drop no-longer needed `BLOCK_ASSUMED_VALID` flag.\r\n\r\nDropping the faked values also fixes assert failures in the `CheckBlockIndex` `(pindex->nChainTx == pindex->nTx + prev_chain_tx)` check that could happen previously if forked or out-of-order blocks before the snapshot got submitted while the snapshot was being validated. The PR includes two commits adding tests for these failures and describing them in detail.\r\n\r\nCompatibility note: This change could cause new `-checkblockindex` failures if a snapshot was loaded by a previous version of Bitcoin Core and not fully validated, because fake `nTx` values will have been saved to the block index. It would be pretty easy to avoid these failures by adding some compatibility code to `LoadBlockIndex` and changing `nTx` values from 1 to 0 when they are fake (when `(pindex->nStatus & BLOCK_VALID_MASK) < BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS`), but a little simpler not to worry about being compatible in this case.",

          "body": "## Goals of this issue\r\n\r\n- Track all ongoing work on assumeutxo until mainnet params are included in a release\r\n- Categorize the work into critical/optional for mainnet readiness\r\n- Conceptual discussion on assumeutxo topics that may or may not be critical for mainnet readiness\r\n\r\nThe initial categorizations here are suggestions and changes should be discussed here in the issue. Obviously let me know if I missed anything.\r\n\r\n## Critical Issues/PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29612 (which fixes #25675) - Improves size of dump, critical because it is not backwards compatible\r\n- [ ] #29519 - Stop syncing non-snapshot chain from peers that are already connected\r\n- [x] #29370 - Get rid of faked nTx and nChainTx values (closing issues discussed in #29261)\r\n- [ ] #28553 - The mainnet params themselves\r\n\r\n## Optional Issues/PRs\r\n\r\n(Attempted a rough ordering by importance)\r\n\r\n- [ ] #28616 (which fixes #28598) - Show background chain funds as not fully confirmed in GUI\r\n- [ ] #29553 - `dumptxoutset` with height param\r\n- [ ] #28670 - Improved error handling for `loadtxoutset`\r\n- [x] #29478 - Additional test coverage for `loadtxoutset`\r\n- [ ] #29617 - Additional test coverage\r\n- [ ] #29428 (draft) - Additional test coverage\r\n- [ ] #28608 (draft) - State and locking cleanup\r\n\r\n## Critical conceptual discussion\r\n\r\n- [ ] Agreement on a rule of thumb which height we choose once there is consensus for mainnet readiness, i.e. how to choose the height for #28553 once we are close to an upcoming release. I think the earlier we discuss this the better, so that this doesn't get in the way later.\r\n\r\n## Optional conceptual discussion\r\n\r\nThese were taken from #28553 and [the original assumeutxo PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27596#issuecomment-1727936044).\r\n\r\n- [ ] Distribution of snapshots - This recently came up [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29551#pullrequestreview-1917416713) and [here](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2024-03-07#1012635;). There are multiple levels to this topic but I believe that this is not critical either way. If it were critical then, at the most basic level, we would probably provide an \"official\" torrent/download link for the dump with the release. It would be great if one or more contributors could do that (@Sjors did this in #28516 for example) and are willing to maintain this for a reasonable amount of time but it is not critical IMO because anyone can use `dumptxoutset` to recreate the dump and then share it any way they like. So there is no need to provide this service from within the project. I think anyone who plans to distribute the dump to other users (think of downstream projects like BTCPayServer, Raspiblitz, Umbrel, Greenlight etc.) should validate the dump like this at least once anyway. And there may even be options for distribution possible for downstream projects that we can not even think of right now but if we don't make the feature available they can also not be explored.\r\n- [ ] Usage of MuHash #27669 - While it would be nice to have this I don't think it is blocking because this can still be introduced later without invalidating existing dumps.\r\n- [ ] Make params configurable/not hardcoded params - I think it would be good to stay on the safe side for now and make the feature available to the public as originally planned. If the feature sees wide adoption and requests for more flexibility come in that would be the right point to explore this further.\r\n- [ ] Should old hashes be removed from source code at some point? - Obviously not relevant for the first mainnet params\r\n- [ ] How frequently should we update testnet/signet params and is there any way to deal with the possibility that these chains [may get nuked at some point](https://x.com/kallewoof/status/1763222648367308958)?",

I think that this existing separation should work well, the problem that this PR fixes is that `FindNextBlocksToDownload` would pick historical blocks from the background chain when it shouldn't because higher-prio blocks are available.",

      "body": "The code and reasoning look good to me and I have been trying to write a test but I am currently unable to reproduce the behavior described before the change, i.e. to make the test fail on master.\r\n\r\nHere is the test so far: https://github.com/fjahr/bitcoin/commit/478fb28dac4e22175da150cee97991a66b4f5695\r\n\r\nThis now does fail on master but only because it also checks for the debug log `HERE` I have added. This log confirms that the test does trigger the behavior change, i.e. on master the last common block is set once, after the change here it is set twice within `FindNextBlockToDownload`. But, of course, we would rather like to have the test fail at the asserts at the end but that is not the case so far.\r\n\r\n@mzumsande do you have an idea why this doesn't reproduce the behavior you have seen on master?",
