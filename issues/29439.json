    "title": "Gathering Priorities of 28.0",
    "body": "Please nominate projects that you are the champion of that could become priorities for the next ~6 months (until the 28.0 release). We (frequent contributors) will vote on which projects will be priorities next week in a separate issue.\r\n\r\nThere were concerns in the voting of previous priority projects that some projects nominated did not have champions who were willing to have their project be a priority project. To ensure that all nominated projects have champions who want their project to be a priority project, nominations are limited to self-nominations only.\r\n\r\nProject priorities are those which the frequent contributors to this project have voted on to have more focused review on for the next ~6 months. This issue is to list what projects are ongoing that can be voted on. Voting will occur in a separate issue that will be opened next week.\r\n\r\nNominations will close at the start of the IRC meeting on February 22nd at 14:00 UTC. The issue for voting will be opened at that time as well.\r\n\r\nNominations and voting is limited to those who are part of the bitcoin github organization. Comments in this issue from those outside of the organization will be ignored, and may be deleted. If you are not part of the organization and believe that you should be, please send me an email or message me on IRC.",
