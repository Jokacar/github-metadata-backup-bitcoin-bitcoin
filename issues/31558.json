This code looks like it has 4 lines that do nothing.\r\n\r\nIn commit: 0fbaef9676a a call to `std::ceil` was added which makes the following `if` statement do nothing. There is no harm done but it makes the code confusing for non-c++ devs to read.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nCAmount CFeeRate::GetFee(uint32_t num_bytes) const\r\n{\r\n    const int64_t nSize{num_bytes};\r\n\r\n    // Be explicit that we're converting from a double to int64_t (CAmount) here.\r\n    // We've previously had issues with the silent double->int64_t conversion.\r\n    CAmount nFee{static_cast<CAmount>(std::ceil(nSatoshisPerK * nSize / 1000.0))};\r\n\r\n    if (nFee == 0 && nSize != 0) {\r\n        if (nSatoshisPerK > 0) nFee = CAmount(1);\r\n        if (nSatoshisPerK < 0) nFee = CAmount(-1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return nFee;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThere is no behaviour issue with the current code.\r\n",
