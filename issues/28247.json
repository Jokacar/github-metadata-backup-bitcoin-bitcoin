    "body": "### Motivation\n\nLosing money on the internet is all too common these days, and I don't see why anyone should be ashamed to admit it. The frightening thing is that anyone can become a victim, regardless of intelligence,I would have considered reporting the theft to law enforcement or the FBI's anti-money laundering unit, but the chances of those actions resulting to the recovery of stolen crypto are extremely remote.\n\n### Possible solution\n\nI learnt about the Reclaim RECOVERY CENTRE INC. through a friend that we both got scammed by the same company , at first I wasnâ€™t buying the idea to reach out to Reclaim RECOVERY CENTRE for assistance until when my friend successfully got back his funds to his Binance Wallet account and I quickly rushed to the find Hacking Team for help .. in my head , I believed if it worked out for my friend it will definitely work out for me as well and am extremely lucky that it did work out perfectly in the end .   It can also work out for you just like it did for me , just send a message to the Reclaim RECOVERY CENTRE INC. on EMAIL: reclaimcryptoagent1 @ gmail.com  wats   app +1  [559 481 1601\n\n### Useful Skills\n\nLOST WALLETS,STOLEN BITCOIN OR LOST BITCOIN\n\n### Guidance for new contributors\n\nWant to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
