    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nThis will crash the application when false:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    ~CCheckQueue()\r\n    {\r\n        assert(m_worker_threads.empty());\r\n    }\r\n```\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nPossibly do something more like this?\r\n```\r\n\r\n    ~CCheckQueue() {   \r\n        try {\r\n            if (!m_worker_threads.empty()) {\r\n                // Attempt to stop worker threads if they haven't been stopped yet.\r\n                StopWorkerThreads();\r\n            }\r\n        } catch (const std::exception& e) {\r\n            LogPrint(BCLog::UTIL, \"Exception in ~CCheckQueue: %s\\n\", e.what());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n    \r\nI am not very familiar with the code base. This just looked weird to me.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nOpen settings in bitcoin-qt, adjust and save.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\nCrash with:\r\n\r\nassertion failure in the file checkqueue.h at line 198. The assertion that failed is m_worker_threads.empty()\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\n26.1\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nWindows, MinGW64 (using portable_endian.h)\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
