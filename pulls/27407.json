          "body": "This PR adds `last_block_announcement` to the per-peer `getpeerinfo` RPC result. This is the most recent time that this peer was the first to notify our node of a new block (one that we didn't already know about), or zero if this peer has never been the first to notify us of a new block. This timestamp already exists internally and is used for stale-tip eviction logic; this PR exposes it at the RPC layer.\r\n\r\nThis PR started out as a suggestion for additional test coverage, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26172#issuecomment-1259678260. It turned out that the easiest way to test (already-merged) #26172 is to add this field to `getpeerinfo` and have a functional test verify its value. But it may also be useful to have this result in its own right, similar to that RPC's existing `last_block` field -- it indicates something about the quality of our peers. It allows one to predict which peer will be evicted when the stale tip logic activates. (I'm not sure if that would be useful, but it may be.)\r\n\r\nExposing this timestamp to the RPC layer required moving it from `CNodeState` to `CNode`, which we want to do anyway, since `CNodeState` is intended for validation, and this timestamp isn't part of validation; it's similar to `last_block` (also used for eviction), which is already in `CNode`.\r\n\r\nThe functional test added here fails without #26172, which is the main goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not test the actual stale-tip eviction logic; that's difficult to do with a functional test. But it does test the correctness of the timestamp that the eviction logic depends on. #23352 is an attempt to test the eviction logic using a unit test, it's not ready to be merged yet. I think having both kinds of tests would be beneficial.",

          "title": "tracing: Only prepare tracepoint arguments when actually tracing",
          "body": "Currently, if the tracepoints are compiled (e.g. in depends and release builds), we always prepare the tracepoint arguments regardless of the tracepoints being used or not. We made sure that the argument preparation is as cheap as possible, but we can almost completely eliminate any overhead for users not interested in the tracepoints (the vast majority), by gating the tracepoint argument preparation with an `if(something is attached to this tracepoint)`. To achieve this, we use the optional semaphore feature provided by SystemTap.\r\n\r\nThe first commit simplifies and deduplicates our tracepoint macros from 12 TRACEn macros to a single TRACEPOINT macro. The `TRACE(context, event)` macro (without arguments) is renamed to `TRACEPOINT0(context, event)`. This makes them easier to use and also avoids more duplicate macro definitions in the second commit. These changes should be compatible with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541 and both https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25832 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26531 should be trivial to rebase and adopt to this.\r\n\r\nThe Linux tracing tools I'm aware of (bcc, bpftrace, libbpf, and systemtap) all support the semaphore gating feature. Thus, all existing tracepoints and their argument preparation is gated in the second commit. For details, please refer to the commit messages and the updated documentation in `doc/tracing.md`.\r\n\r\nAlso adding unit tests that include all tracepoint macros to make sure there are no compiler problems with them (e.g. some varadiac extension not supported). \r\n\r\nReviewers might want to check:\r\n- Do the tracepoints still work for you? Do the examples in `contrib/tracing/` run on your system (as bpftrace frequently breaks on every new version, please test master too if it should't work for you)? Do the CI interface tests still pass?\r\n- Is the new documentation clear? \r\n- As a demonstration that the tracepoint gating works, https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin/commit/21774ab9618932a4df68baa36de11c7788adf143 extends the PR branch. Here is the [Cirrus CI output](https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5278617885212672) for the task running the USDT interface tests on this commit. Do you agree that this demonstrates that the semaphore gating works?\r\n- The `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE(event, context)` macros places global variables in our global namespace. Is this something we strictly want to avoid or maybe move to all `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE`s to a separate .cpp file or even namespace? I like having the `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE()` in same file as the `TRACEPOINT()`, but open for suggestion on alternative approaches. \r\n- Are newly added tracepoints in the unit tests visible when using `readelf -n /src/test/test_bitcoin`? You can run the new unit tests with `./src/test/test_bitcoin --run_test=util_trace_tests* --log_level=all`.\r\n\r\nThese links might provide more contextual information for reviewers:\r\n- [How SystemTap Userspace Probes Work by eklitzke](https://eklitzke.org/how-sytemtap-userspace-probes-work) (actually an example on Bitcoin Core; mentions that with semaphores \"the overhead for an untraced process is effectively zero.\")\r\n- [libbpf comment on USDT semaphore handling](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/blob/1596a09b5de2a50ab8d44218fc29b6d42f886305/src/usdt.c#L83-L92) (can recommend the whole comment for background on how the tracepoints and tracing tools work together)\r\n- https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/UserSpaceProbeImplementation#Semaphore_Handling",

          "body": "Efficient isolated fuzzing of our message processing code (net processing) would be very valuable. However, to make that deterministic, fast and fuzzer friendly it appears that extensive refactoring is required. There are three main blockers: module separation (net/net processing/validation split), determinism, performance.\r\n\r\nI am gonna use this issue to track and motivate the work that needs to be done. It would be great if we can achieve the same outcome with less refactoring but I don't see how at the moment. Open to suggestions and feedback.\r\n\r\n### Module separation\r\n\r\nOnce we have a clean separation between our net, net processing and validation modules, we can fuzz/test them in isolation to maximize the bug yield (üêõ, ü™≤, ü™≥). By design, most fuzzing engines are not great at finding bugs when the scope of the targets is too large (e.g. fuzzing net, net processing and validation all at once).\r\n\r\n* net / net processing split\r\n  * Move application layer data from net to net processing ([#19398](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19398))\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26621\r\n  * Define a clean interface between net processing <-> net \r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25268\r\n      - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25500\r\n      - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25572\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25515\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27407\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27257\r\n* net processing / validation split (lots of overlap with kernel)\r\n  * Reduce `cs_main` usage in net processing\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26151\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26140\r\n    - [ ] Kill CNodeState\r\n  * Define a clean interface between net processing <-> validation\r\n\r\n### Determinism\r\n\r\nNon-deterministic fuzz targets are less efficient at finding bugs and debugging non-reproducible bugs is annoying/costly.\r\n\r\n* All required components should be newly setup for each target execution\r\n  * Can be done currently using our testing setup suite but that's waaaay too slow for fuzzing.\r\n* Avoid  `GetRand()` (mock it?)\r\n* Avoid globals (are there any globals left in net processing?)\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nFuzzing is a search, the faster the search - the better.\r\n\r\n* LevelDB (is in memory but still slow?)\r\n  * Probably solved by mocking out validation?\r\n* PeerManager construction is expensive because it requires multi megabyte allocations each time (mostly due to large bloom filters)\r\n* Disk usage\r\n  * Block storage\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125\r\n    - [ ] Create a mock of BlockManager for in memory block storage?\r\n  * BanMan (banlist is written to disk)\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n* Decouple net processing from ArgsMan (args setup is slow)\r\n  * Allows to fuzz the peerman options without depending on the global args man \r\n  - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27499\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you think there are PRs that aren't listed here but should be.\r\n",

          "body": "To improve privacy, relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for relaying sensitive data (our own transactions) with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local unbroadcast transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer and the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed\r\n\r\n* Relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers.\r\n\r\n* Hide those transactions from `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` requests, as if we don't have them.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, request the transaction with `GETDATA`, as if we didn't have it before.\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the unbroadcast list.\r\n\r\n* `INV` it to others as a result of the `TX` message we get, like what we do with transactions that are not ours.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new local transaction is received (from the wallet or RPC), the node will send it to 5 (`SENSITIVE_RELAY_NUM_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 5 more peers (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptInitialBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived sensitive relay connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers will blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [x] Disable if `-connect` is used or Tor and I2P are not reachable.\r\n* [x] Use I2P transient connections even if listening on I2P.\r\n* [x] Do something with the user-agent string (could reveal identity if it has been personalized) and make sure no identifying information in the `VERSION` message. Done: took the [suggestion below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#issuecomment-1517896418).\r\n* [x] Improve the condition when we consider the transaction seen by the network: right now a single INV from somebody suffices (this is still an improvement over `master` which is ok right after pushing the tx to a peer). We could wait for more than one INV, from peers that we have selected (outbound) and that are specifically not the ones we broadcasted to (via short-lived connection). Edit: One `INV` should be enough because after that we broadcast the transaction to everybody we are connected to (like if it is not ours).\r\n* [ ] Idea: start with one connection per transaction (not 5 as it is now), optimistically assuming it will be sufficient. (numbers are examples) After 1 minute, if still not received from the network, try 2 connections, after a few minutes try more. If still unsuccessful after 10 minutes, then fall back to the old mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to address:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450\r\n",

More information on the RPC design and implementation can be found in that issue.\r\n\r\n**_Massive_** thank-you to amitiuttarwar, vasild, and ajtowns for their help on this :pray: Over the course of several months, they have patiently provided a tremendous amount of guidance and assistance in more ways than I can count! \r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n## getnetmsgstats RPC\r\nReturns the message count and total number of bytes for sent and received network traffic. Results may optionally be arranged by direction, network, connection type and/or message type.\r\n\r\n### Arguments\r\n\r\n**show_only**: an optional array of one or more dimensions to show as part of the results. Valid options are: direction, network, message_type, and connection_type. If no dimensions are specified, totals are returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nBelow are some examples on how the new `getnetmsgstats` RPC can be used.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n

}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Things to consider\r\n\r\n### RPC behavior: Should we allow dimensions to be rearraged?\r\n\r\nWhen it comes time to gather up the RPC results, @vasild has provided an [alternate implementation](https://github.com/vasild/bitcoin/commits/getnetmsgstats) that uses an array instead of the `MultiMap` structure. This results in two changes:\r\n\r\n- using the stack over the heap (yay!)\r\n- enforcing a strict ordering of dimensions (direction, network, connection type, message type)\r\n\r\nAside from being good for memory, the reasoning here is allowing users to rearrange dimensions may be too confusing. I personally really like the ability to rearrange dimensions, which is why I have not integrated that solution into this PR, but am open to whatever the larger community prefers :)\r\n\r\n### Locking & Consistency Beyond Individual Values\r\n\r\nWith atomics, we know we can rely on the values for individual stats like bye count and message count. However, the byte count and message count may not always match. For example, let‚Äôs say we currently have 5 messages, and 100 bytes:\r\n\r\n    1. A new 20 byte message comes in. First the byte count is incremented to 120.\r\n    2. A request to read the stats comes in. The RPC returns message count 5 and byte count 120.\r\n    3. The message count is incremented to 6 in response to the new message that came in at step 1.\r\n\r\nThe read operation did not return accurate data! Unlike the torn write example for a single value, It returned data that was true for some point in time, it‚Äôs just that the values for message count and byte count were inconsistent.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, it‚Äôs actually not enough to lock the `MsgStat` struct. It's my understanding that you need a mutex to protect the entire `NetStats` data structure.\r\n\r\nThe trade off here isn‚Äôt attractive. A lock would halt network threads that are doing important stuff, all for the sake of consistent stats. Even for reads, we would have to stop writes. We‚Äôd end up stopping threads that are doing important things for something that is not that important.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is how often will this RPC be called? If it‚Äôs once in a blue moon, then such a mutex is probably fine. But for a live dashboard that is making a call every second, this is not acceptable.\r\n\r\n### Making Enum Indices Safe and Reliable\r\n\r\n`src/net.cpp` contains a bunch of `*To/FromIndex()` methods that convert an enum to an index number. I‚Äôve decided to be explicit about these conversions because enums are not guaranteed to start at zero and it‚Äôs not enough to simply associate the first value in an enum with a number. \r\n\r\nTo protect against potential gaps or overlaps in numbering, every single enum value must be assigned an index. This is the only way to guarantee that the numbering is safe and reliable. \r\n\r\nInstead of updating the existing `Network` and `ConnectionType` enums to assign indices to each enum value, and risk unintentionally modifying the behavior of code that uses these enums, I‚Äôve opted for the conversion methods. This also narrows the scope of the conversion methods, making changed behavior easier to spot if the indices are modified.\r\n\r\nI‚Äôm interested in feedback on this. The `*To/FromIndex()` methods have low review and maintenance cost, but I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôve correctly evaluated the risks associated with updating the `Network` and `ConnectionType` enums <can insert an example of assigning specific indices to each enum value>. Also open to discussion on if there is a better place for these conversion methods to live.\r\n",

There, it has been observed that if both sides of a P2P connection have a significant amount of data to send, a stall can occur, where both try to drain their own send queue before trying to receive. The same issue seems to apply to the current Bitcoin Core codebase, though I don't know whether it's a frequent issue for us.\r\n\r\nThe core issue is that whenever our optimistic send fails to fully send a message, we do subsequently not even select() for receiving; if it then turns out that sending is not possible either, no progress is made at all. To address this, the solution used in this PR is to still select() for both sending and receiving when an optimistic send fails, but skip receiving if sending succeeded, and (still) doesn't fully drain the send queue.\r\n\r\nThis is a significant reduction in how aggressive the \"receive pushback\" mechanism is, because now it will only mildly push back while sending progress is made; if the other side stops receiving entirely, the pushback disappears. I don't think that's a serious problem though:\r\n* We still have a pushback mechanism at the application buffer level (when the application receive buffer overflows, receiving is paused until messages in the buffer get processed; waiting on our own net_processing thread, not on the remote party).\r\n* There are cases where the existing mechanism is too aggressive; e.g. when the send queue is non-empty, but tiny, and can be sent with a single send() call. In that case, I think we'd prefer to still receive within the same processing loop of the network thread.\r\n",

Logging was added pre-patch to document the delay through the queue and was observed for both send and receive to be occasionally > 30 seconds when the daemon was busy following the tip or during reorgs when the cup utilization for the assigned core  approached 100%.  Significant queue delay occurs most often in the receive queue (several times a minute) and infrequently in the send queue ( 1 observation in several hours of testing ).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n  _Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply._\r\n- [X ] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [X ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [ ] I have added or updated relevant unit/integration/functional/e2e tests\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have assigned this pull request to a milestone _(for repository code-owners and collaborators only)_\r\n",

          "title": "net: transport abstraction",
          "body": "This PR furthers the P2P message serialization/deserialization abstraction introduced in #16202 and #16562, in preparation for introducing the BIP324 v2 transport (making this part of #27634). However, nothing in this PR is BIP324-specific, and it contains a number of independently useful improvements.\r\n\r\nThe overall idea is to have a single object in every `CNode` (called `m_transport`) that is responsible for converting sent messages to wire bytes, and for converting received wire bytes back to messages, while having as little as possible knowledge about this conversion process in higher-level net code. To accomplish that, there is an abstract `Transport` class with (currently) a single `V1Transport` implementation.\r\n\r\nStructurally, the above is accomplished by:\r\n* Merging the `TransportDeserializer` and `TransportSerializer` classes into a single `Transport` class, which encompasses both the sending and receiving side. For `V1Transport` these two sides are entirely separate, but this assumption doesn't hold for the BIP324 transport where e.g. the sending encryption key depends on the DH key negotiation data received from the other side. Merging the two means a future `V2Transport` can handle all this interaction without callers needing to be aware.\r\n* Removing the assumption that each message is sent using a computed header followed by (unmodified) data bytes. To achieve that, the sending side of `Transport` mirrors what the receiver side does: callers can set a message to be sent, then ask what bytes must be sent out, and then allowing them to transition to the next message.\r\n* Adding internal locks to protect the sending and receiving state of the `V1Transport` implementation. I believe these aren't strictly needed (opinions welcome) as there is no real way to use `Transport` objects in a multi-threaded fashion without some form of external synchronization (e.g. \"get next bytes to send\" isn't meaningful to call from multiple threads at the same time without mechanism to control the order they'll actually get sent). Still, I feel it's cleaner to make the object responsible for its own consistency (as we definitely do not want the entire object to be under a single external GUARDED_BY, as that'd prevent simultaneous sending and receiving).\r\n* Moving the conversion of messages to bytes on the sending side from `PushMessage` to `SocketSendData`, which is needed to deal with the fact that a transport may not immediately be able to send messages.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a refactor, though some commits are. Among the semantic changes are:\r\n* Changing the send buffer pushback mechanism to trigger based on the memory usage of the buffer rather than the amount of bytes to be sent. This is both closer to the desired behavior, and makes the buffering independent from transport details (which is why it's included here).\r\n* When optimistic send is not applicable, the V1 message checksum calculation now runs in the net thread rather than the message handling thread. I believe that's generally an improvement, as the message handling thread is far more computationally bottlenecked already.\r\n* The checksum calculation now runs under the `CNode::cs_vSend` lock, which does mean no two checksum calculations for messages sent to the same node can run in parallel, even if running in separate threads. Despite that limitation, having the checksum for non-optimistic sends moved in the net thread is still an improvement, I believe.\r\n* Statistics for per-message-type sent bytes are now updated when the bytes are actually handed to the OS rather than in `PushMessage`. This is because the actual serialized sizes aren't known until they've gone through the transport object.\r\n\r\nA fuzz test of the entire `V1Transport` is included. More elaborate rationale for each of the changes can be found in the commit messages.",
