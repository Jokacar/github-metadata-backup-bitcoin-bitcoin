    "body": "Enable `sethdseed` for descriptor wallets. To be able to use `createwalletdescriptor` with the other address types, we need a way to change the wallet extended key, and so `sethdseed` has been updated and enabled for descriptor wallets. As with legacy wallets, when called without parameters, it will generate a new random master key for the wallet. It can also take a xprv and set that as the master key. It still takes a BIP 32 seed as WIF or as hex as we do for legacy wallets. The seed will be transformed into and stored as a BIP 32 extended key. The latter is to give us greater compatibility with other wallets which often produce non-WIF HD seeds.\r\n\r\nSplit from #25907",

This is especially useful when a new default descriptor has been implemented as it allows wallets created before that time to quickly and easily add that type of descriptor.\r\n\r\nIn particular, descriptor wallets created before Taproot was implemented can use the new `createwalletdescriptor` RPC in order to get a Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to keep the newly generated descriptor in line with the existing descriptors, this PR uses #26728 as it exposes a \"wallet extended key\" for us (in addition to upgrading wallets implemented prior to have a wallet xpub). The newly generated descriptors will use the \"wallet extended key\" stored in `CWallet` that PR adds.\r\n\r\n`createwalletdescriptor` is generic and so it can also be used with the other address types. Of course, it given the same wallet extended key, address type, and internal-ness, it will create the same descriptor. So some refactoring has been done in order to detect that the same descriptor is about to be created, and to avoid overwriting any existing descriptors.",

          "title": "RPC: add new `listmempooltransactions`",
          "body": "## Proposed Update\r\n\r\nAdd a new RPC endpoint, `listmempooltransactions`. Takes as args a `start_sequence` and `verbose`.\r\n\r\nReturns: \r\n- if verbose false, list of txids + their `entry_sequence` where each entry's `entry_sequence` >= the provided `start_sequence.\r\n- if verbose true, raw tx output info including each entry's `entry_sequence`.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilds on work done in #19572.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\nThe current mempool RPCs are lacking an ability to scan for updates in a more efficient manner. You can subscribe for updates via the ZMQ pipeline, but even this is inefficient to recover from if your consumer app falls offline.\r\n\r\nZMQ also is a push protocol, and doesn't provide a rate-limiting mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn the case of core-lightning, we don't assume access to bitcoin-core/ZMQ, so we're unable to do efficient mempool querying. There have been some recent CVEs come to light where having optional access to mempool updates may prove useful.\r\n\r\nPaging, filtering by last seen, and the addition of full tx data in the call makes mempool data more readily available to any client app. This is good for self-sovereignty as it reduces the need for additional dependencies and app data sources to efficiently query and parse mempool data. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Things I Considered\r\nMy initial attempt at this modified `getrawmempool` to \r\n- take a `start_sequence` to allow for filtering, and\r\n- adding the txdata (inputs outpoints + outputs (amount + scriptPubKeys)). \r\n\r\nThat was pretty ugly however, given that the current data model for `getrawmempool` is around a concept of \"mempool entry\" data. This returns transaction data (and does not report on information about other mempool dependencies etc; for that you should still call `getrawmempool` or `getmempoolentry`). \r\n\r\nYou could add a `start_sequence` to the existing `getrawmempool` to help with entry data paging/querying but that's secondary to my goals for fetching relevant txdata from the mempool.\r\n\r\n## Additions/Changes\r\n\r\nThis PR could be further improved by\r\n- Add a `page_size` argument which allows a calling application to limit the number of results returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\nThe current RPC only supports finding *added* mempool transactions. It'd be interesting to experiment with keeping track of evicted/not mined transactions and adding them to the results.\r\n\r\nThis would require:\r\n- An additional memory buffer (perhaps a configurable memory limited ring buffer?) for evicted tx data and the mempool sequence of the eviction.\r\n- Adding a `sequence_action` field for results, which indicates whether the sequence is for the tx's `addition` or `eviction`.\r\n\r\nYou could also keep track of tx movements into blocks, but this seems less useful/urgent in general.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nYou can see an example of this implemented and used in CLN for finding paid onchain invoices in this branch: https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/compare/master...niftynei:lightning:nifty/mempool-scan\r\n\r\nNote that the CLN implementation doesn't currently keep the mempool_sequence in disk, so it'll reload/rescan the mempool at start. This *may* be desirable?\r\n\r\nHere's how a caller would use this\r\n\r\n```\r\n1) start node\r\n2) listmempooltransactions 0 to get backlog\r\n3) call listmempooltransactions again with `start_sequence` set to `mempool_sequence` result from last call\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this works well with ZMQ as the `mempool_sequence` number is identical.",

          "body": "The benchmark conducted locally showed a ~65% processing time reduction, on a SSD.\r\nResults can be found at the end of the description.\r\n\r\n#### Detailed Description:\r\nThe current wallet migration process performs only individual db writes. Accessing disk to\r\ndelete all legacy records, clone and clean each address book entry for every created wallet,\r\ncreate each new descriptor (with their corresponding master key, caches and key pool), and\r\nalso clone and delete each transaction that requires to be transferred to a different wallet.\r\n\r\nThis work consolidates all individual disk writes into two batch operations. One for the descriptors\r\ncreation from the legacy data and a second one for the execution of the migration process itself.\r\nEfficiently dumping all the information to disk at once atomically at the end of each process.\r\n\r\nThis represent a speed up and also a consistency improvement. During migration, we either\r\nwant to succeed or fail. No other outcomes should be accepted. We should never leave a\r\npartially migrated wallet on disk and request the user to manually restore the previous wallet from\r\na backup (at least not if we can avoid it).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since db transactions relevant to the key pool generation were also batched, this work\r\nalso speeds up the regular wallet creation process.\r\n\r\n#### Note for Testers:\r\nThe first commit introduces a benchmark for the migration process. This one can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master to compare results pre and post changes.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the benchmark setup may take some time (~70 seconds here) due to the absence\r\nof a batching mechanism for the address generation process (`GetNewDestination()` calls). Which,\r\nI plan to address in a separate PR, just to not continue expanding this PR.\r\n\r\n#### Final Notes:\r\nThis PR is intended to be an \"all-in-one\" solution that's ready for use and testing. In the coming days, \r\nwill start breaking it down into smaller, focused PRs for better manageability and review.\r\n\r\n————————————————————————\r\n\r\nBenchmark on master (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:-----------\r\n|   65,093,884,958.00 |                0.02 |    0.0% |     65.09 | `WalletMigration`\r\n\r\nBenchmark on this branch (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|   22,926,814,750.00 |                0.04 |    0.0% |     22.93 | `WalletMigration`",

          "body": "A couple of users have requested that we support wallets that encrypt everything, even if the wallet is watch-only, in order to have better privacy if the wallet is stolen. This PR introduces an `EncryptedDatabase` backend for the wallet which encrypts/decrypts each key-value record individually before reading from or writing to the database.\r\n\r\n`EncryptedDatabase` is only supported for SQLite databases and descriptor wallets. This was done in order to have an easier way to get downgrade protection that also does not involve writing an existing record in plaintext (e.g. `minversion` or `flags`). SQLite has a fixed field \"application id\" that we already use for cross-network protection. This is reused to detect if a sqlite database is an encrypted wallet, and thus it prevents older software from attempting to open such wallets.\r\n\r\nIn order to read records from the database, `EncryptedDatabase` will cache the decrypted key in memory so that it can lookup the encrypted key in the database. Values will always be decrypted when read.\r\n\r\nThe encryption scheme is the same one that we use for encrypting private keys. It's not that great, but I didn't feel like re-implementing it, and it seems good enough. The encryption key itself is encrypted with the passphrase and stored in a new record.\r\n\r\nWallets with encrypted databases cannot be loaded on start. They can only be loaded by explicit user action through `loadwallet` which now has a `db_passphrase` parameter to allow the decryption of these wallets. `createwallet` also has a `db_passphrase` to create these wallets. For now, there is no way to encrypt the database after it has been created, nor is there a way to change the passphrase.",

This is done in various places, such as `IsMine`, and helper functions for fetching a `ScriptPubKeyMan` and a `SolvingProvider`. This also has a bit of a performance impact on standard descriptor wallets, although less noticeable due to the small number of SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAs these functions are based on doing `IsMine` for each `ScriptPubKeyMan`, we can improve this performance by caching `IsMine` scriptPubKeys for all descriptors and use that to determine which `ScriptPubKeyMan` to actually use for those things. This cache is used exclusively and we no longer iterate the SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAlso added a benchmark for `IsMine`.",

          "body": "This PR introduces support for v2 P2P encryption(BIP 324) in the existing functional test framework and adds functional tests for the same.\r\n\r\n### commits overview\r\n1. introduces a new class `EncryptedP2PState` to store the keys, functions for performing the initial v2 handshake and encryption/decryption.\r\n3. this class is used by `P2PConnection` in inbound/outbound connections to perform the initial v2 handshake before the v1 version handshake. Only after the initial v2 handshake is performed do application layer P2P messages(version, verack etc..) get exchanged. (in a v2 connection)\r\n    - `v2_state` is the object of class `EncryptedP2PState` in `P2PConnection` used to store its keys, session-id etc.\r\n    - a node [advertising](https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md#advertising-to-support-v2-p2p) support for  v2 P2P is different from a node actually [supporting v2 P2P](https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md#supporting-v2-p2p) (differ when false advertisement of services occur)\r\n        - introduce a boolean variable `supports_v2_p2p` in `P2PConnection` to denote if it supports v2 P2P.\r\n        - introduce a boolean variable `advertises_v2_p2p` to denote whether `P2PConnection` which mimics peer behaviour advertises V2 P2P support. Default option is `False`.\r\n    - In the test framework, you can create Inbound and Outbound connections to `TestNode`\r\n        1. During **Inbound Connections**, `P2PConnection` is the initiator [`TestNode` <--------- `P2PConnection`]\r\n            - Case 1:\r\n                - if the `TestNode` advertises/signals v2 P2P support (means `self.nodes[i]` set up with `\"-v2transport=1\"`), different behaviour will be exhibited based on whether:\r\n                    1. `P2PConnection` supports v2 P2P\r\n                    2. `P2PConnection` does not support v2 P2P\r\n               - In a real world scenario, the initiator node would intrinsically know if they support v2 P2P based on whatever code they choose to run. However, in the test scenario where we mimic peer behaviour, we have no way of knowing if `P2PConnection` should support v2 P2P or not. So `supports_v2_p2p` boolean variable is used as an option to enable support for v2 P2P in `P2PConnection`.\r\n              - Since the `TestNode` advertises v2 P2P support (using \"-v2transport=1\"), our initiator `P2PConnection` would send:\r\n                1. (if the `P2PConnection` supports v2 P2P) ellswift + garbage bytes to initiate the connection\r\n                2. (if the `P2PConnection` does not support v2 P2P) version message to initiate the connection\r\n           - Case 2:\r\n                - if the `TestNode` doesn't signal v2 P2P support; `P2PConnection` being the initiator would send version message to initiate a connection.\r\n       2. During **Outbound Connections** [TestNode --------> P2PConnection]\r\n           - initiator `TestNode` would send:\r\n                - (if the `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P) ellswift + garbage bytes to initiate the connection\r\n                - (if the `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P) version message to initiate the connection\r\n          - Suppose `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P support when it actually doesn't support v2 P2P (false advertisement scenario)\r\n               - `TestNode` sends ellswift + garbage bytes\r\n               - `P2PConnection` receives but can't process it and disconnects.\r\n               - `TestNode` then tries using v1 P2P and sends version message\r\n               - `P2PConnection` receives/processes this successfully and they communicate on v1 P2P\r\n\r\n4. the encrypted P2P messages follow a different format - 3 byte length + 1-13 byte message_type + payload + 16 byte MAC\r\n5. includes support for testing decoy messages and v2 connection downgrade(using false advertisement - when a v2 node makes an outbound connection to a node which doesn't support v2 but is advertised as v2 by some malicious\r\nintermediary)\r\n\r\n### run the tests\r\n* functional test - `test/functional/p2p_v2_encrypted.py` `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py`\r\n\r\nI'm also super grateful to @ dhruv for his really valuable feedback on this branch.\r\nAlso written a more elaborate explanation here - https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md",

          "title": "descriptors: Be able to specify change and receiving in a single descriptor string",
          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",

It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",

This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

Here I'll just copy the relevant context for the wallet API changes:\r\n\r\n\"_In short, Paul's idea is to periodically split coins and send them to yourself, making it look like common \"spend\" transactions, such that blockchain ownership analysis becomes more difficult, and thus improving the user's privacy.\r\nWe've implemented this as an additional \"Deniability\" wallet view. The majority of the code is in a new deniabilitydialog.cpp/h source files containing a new DeniabilityDialog class, hooked up to the WalletView class._ \"\r\n\r\nWhile the Deniability dialog can be implemented entirely with the existing API, adding the core \"deniabilization\" functions to the interfaces::Wallet API allows us to implement the GUI portion with much less code, and more importantly allows us to add RPC support and more thorough unit tests, which is what this PR attempts to do.\r\n\r\nThe main \"deniabilization\" functionality is implemented in spend.cpp/h and feebumper.cpp/h and exposed via the interfaces::Wallet API. \r\nWe've added RPC support via a new RPC call \"walletdeniabilizecoin\". \r\nWe also extended the Wallet tests with coverage for the functionality.\r\n",

          "title": "wallet: Keep track of the wallet's own transaction outputs in memory",
          "body": "Currently, the wallet is not actually aware about its own transaction outputs. Instead, it will iterate all of the transactions stored in `mapWallet`, and then all of the outputs of those transactions, in order to figure out what belongs to it for the purposes of coin selection and balance calculation. For balance calculation, there is caching that results in it only iterating all of the transactions, but not all of the outputs. However when the cache is dirty, everything is iterated. This is especially problematic for wallets that have a lot of transactions, or transactions that have a lot of unrelated outputs (as may occur with coinjoins or batched payments).\r\n\r\nThis PR helps to resolve this issue by making the wallet track all of the outputs that belong to it in a new member `m_txos`. Note that this includes outputs that may have already been spent. Both balance calculation (`GetBalance`) and coin selection (`AvailableCoins`) are updated to iterate `m_txos`. This is generally faster since it ignores all of the unrelated outputs, and it is not slower as in the worst case of wallets containing only single output transactions, it's exactly the same number of outputs iterated.\r\n\r\n`m_txos` is memory only, and it is populated during wallet loading. When each transaction is loaded, all of its outputs are checked to see if it is `IsMine`, and if so, an entry added to `m_txos`. When new transactions are received, the same procedure is done.\r\n\r\nSince imports can change the `IsMine` status of a transaction (although they can only be \"promoted\" from watchonly to spendable), all of the import RPCs will be a bit slower as they re-iterate all transactions and all outputs to update `m_txos`.\r\n\r\nEach output in `m_txos` is stored in a new `WalletTXO` class. This class contains references to the parent `CWalletTx` and the `CTxOut` itself. It also caches the `IsMine` value of the txout. This should be safe as `IsMine` should not change unless there are imports. This allows us to have additional performance improvements in places that use these `WalletTXO`s as they can use the cached `IsMine` rather than repeatedly calling `IsMine` which can be expensive.\r\n\r\nThe existing `WalletBalance` benchmark demonstrates the performance improvement that this PR makes. The existing `WalletAvailableCoins` benchmark doesn't as all of the outputs used in that benchmark belong to the test wallet. I've updated that benchmark to have a bunch of unrelated outputs in each transaction so that the difference is demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a larger project to have the wallet actually track and store a set of its UTXOs.\r\n\r\nBuilt on #24914 as it requires loading the txs last in order for `m_txos` to be built correctly.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks:\r\n\r\nMaster:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       92,245,141.50 |               10.84 |    0.1% |  988,823,975.00 |  66,803,340.50 |    0.0% |      2.04 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            5,709.90 |          175,134.50 |    0.5% |       80,968.24 |      25,539.15 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|          139,396.17 |            7,173.80 |    0.6% |    1,383,390.50 |     430,276.86 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            5,055.80 |          197,792.47 |    0.3% |       80,968.10 |      25,539.02 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|                9.79 |      102,152,396.19 |    0.1% |          161.00 |          37.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,552,736.00 |              644.02 |    1.5% |   20,316,315.80 |     618,545.80 |    0.6% |      0.08 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|      114,114,732.00 |                8.76 |    0.5% |1,291,047,717.60 | 320,244,602.00 |    0.0% |      6.30 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      359,315,754.00 |                2.78 |    0.1% |4,339,447,818.00 | 136,619,757.00 |    0.7% |      1.80 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|       98,230,601.00 |               10.18 |    0.1% |  537,688,964.00 |  97,332,266.00 |    0.3% |      0.49 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n\r\nPR:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       75,319,868.50 |               13.28 |    0.2% |  863,758,229.00 |  30,892,593.00 |    0.2% |      1.66 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            2,367.62 |          422,364.95 |    1.0% |       35,785.05 |       9,893.01 |    0.2% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|            2,685.58 |          372,359.55 |    0.2% |       36,501.05 |      10,027.01 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            3,462.24 |          288,830.68 |    2.7% |       35,785.06 |       9,893.01 |    0.3% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|               11.65 |       85,838,176.97 |    0.1% |          180.00 |          42.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,563,092.60 |              639.76 |    1.5% |   20,426,154.40 |     649,953.80 |    0.6% |      0.09 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|       58,367,804.40 |               17.13 |    0.9% |  587,164,005.00 | 107,905,843.80 |    0.1% |      3.21 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      365,302,636.00 |                2.74 |    0.2% |4,349,345,147.00 | 138,730,668.00 |    0.8% |      1.83 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|      124,995,585.00 |                8.00 |    1.2% |  801,998,316.00 | 103,210,721.00 |    0.3% |      0.63 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n",

This makes it difficult to add new automatically generated descriptors when new ones are introduced. So instead of losing this information after the descriptors are created, have `CWallet` store it. The xpub will be stored in a new `activehdkey` field. The private key must be one of the keys that is used by the descriptors, and will be extracted upon loading.\r\n\r\nAs this is a new field, wallets will be automatically upgraded upon loading. This loading is backwards compatible and uses a new non-required flag `WALLET_FLAG_GLOBAL_HD_KEY` to signal that the upgrade completed. The upgrade will search for an xpub that is shared by `pkh()`, `wpkh()`, and `sh(wpkh()` descriptors with the derivation pattern that we use. For new wallets, the xpub will be set during descriptor creation rather than trying to reverse engineer it. The flag will be set for all wallets, regardless of whether such an xpub was found or can even exist, in order to indicate that the upgrade will not need to be run in the future.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to have a `gethdkey` command which is useful for those who need a simple way to get an xpub from a wallet. `gethdkey` can also take a boolean parameter to indicate whether it should also output the corresponding xprv.\r\n\r\nSupercedes #23417",

          "title": "Deniability - a tool to automatically improve coin ownership privacy",
          "body": "This new feature is an implementation of the ideas in Paul Sztorc's blog post \"Deniability - Unilateral Transaction Meta-Privacy\"(https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/deniability/).\r\n\r\nIn short, the idea is to periodically split coins and send them to yourself, making it look like common \"spend\" transactions, such that blockchain ownership analysis becomes more difficult, and thus improving the user's privacy.\r\n\r\nThis is the GUI portion of the PR (bitcoin-core/gui). The core functionality PR ( https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27792 ) is in the main repo (bitcoin/bitcoin).\r\n\r\nThis PR implements an additional \"Deniability\" wallet view. The majority of the GUI code is in a new deniabilitydialog.cpp/h source files containing a new DeniabilityDialog class, hooked up via the WalletView class. \r\n\r\nOn startup and on notable events (new blocks, new transactions, etc), we evaluate the privacy of all coins in the wallet, and we build a \"deniabilization\" candidate list. UTXOs that share the same destination address are grouped together into a single candidate (see DeniabilityDialog::updateCoins and DeniabilityDialog::updateCoinTable).\r\n\r\nWe inspect the blockchain data to find out if we have performed \"deniabilization\" transactions already, and we count how many \"cycles\" (self-sends) have been performed for each coin (see DeniabilityDialog::calculateDeniabilizationStats). Since we infer the state entirely from the blockchain data, even if the wallet is restored from a backup, the state would not be lost. This also means that if the user has performed manual self-sends that have improved the ownership privacy, they will be counted too.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_initial\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/6626cca3-1b96-4ccd-9463-2a91a9993faa\">\r\n\r\nThe user has a couple of controls for the \"deniabillization\" process - a Frequency selector and a Budget spinner, which respectively determine how often to perform a cycle (see below) and how much total BTC to spend on transaction fees.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_pick_budget_frequency\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/7508c23f-2ebb-4345-a440-49b9f60b8412\">\r\n\r\nThe user can initiate the \"deniabillization\" process by pressing the Start button (DeniabilityDialog::startDeniabilization). \r\nThe first time the button is pressed, we offer an information / confirmation box to explain to the user how Deniability works.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"532\" alt=\"deniability_view_start_confirmation\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/c08ee856-8736-4e4e-be71-28219735f764\">\r\n\r\nThe process periodically perform a \"deniabilization\" cycle (DeniabilityDialog::deniabilizeProc). In each such cycle we do the following: \r\nA coin is selected form the candidate list. The more a coin is \"deniabilized\", the less likely it is to be selected. Smaller coins are also less likely to be selected. If a coin is selected, we prepare and broadcast a transaction, which splits the coin into a pair of new wallet addresses (DeniabilityDialog::deniabilizeCoin). \r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_tx_awaiting_confirmation\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/df0354dc-f60f-45db-b692-db5c6ca36253\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"transaction_view_after_deniabilization\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/709084d3-227d-4c0d-ac47-cd83433b992a\">\r\n\r\nIf Bitcoin Core is left running continuously, the cycles would be performed at the selected frequency (with some randomization). If Bitcoin Core is shutdown, the \"deniabilization\" process will resume at the next restart, and if more time has elapsed than the selected frequency, it will perform a single cycle. We deliberately don't \"catch up\" all missed cycles, since that would expose the process to blockchain analysis. The state is saved and restored via QSettings (DeniabilityDialog::loadSettings and DeniabilityDialog::saveSettings).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_next_cycle_countdown\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/da5a71e1-0174-4f2a-a9b3-b8a635abe769\">\r\n\r\nWe monitor each broadcasted transaction and we automatically attempt a fee bump if the transaction is still in the memory pool since the previous cycle (DeniabilityDialog::bumpDeniabilizationTx). We don't issue any other deniabilization transactions until the previous transaction is confirmed (or abandoned/dropped).\r\n\r\nThe process ends when the budget is exhausted or if there's no candidates left. The user can also stop the process manually by pressing a Stop button (DeniabilityDialog::stopDeniabilization).\r\n\r\nExternal signers are supported in a \"best effort\" way - since the user needs to manually sign, we postpone the deniabilization processing till the external signer is connected and use some additional UI to get the user's attention to sign (see the codepath predicated on hasExternalSigner). This is not ideal, so I'm looking for ideas if we can improve this in some way.\r\n\r\nWatch-only wallets are partially supported, where we display the candidate list, but we don't allow any processing (since we don't have the private keys to issue transactions).\r\n\r\nI've tested all this functionality on regtest, testnet, signet and mainnet. I've also added some unit tests (under WalletTests) to exercise the main functions.\r\n\r\nThis is my first change and PR for Bitcoin Core, and I did my best to validate everything against the guidelines and documentation and to follow the patterns in the existing code, but I'm sure there may be things I've missed, so I'm looking forward to your feedback. \r\nIn particular one thing I'm not particularly happy with - the save/restore of state via QSettings makes me a bit nervous as we store wallet specific data keyed on wallet name, however wallets can be erased and new ones created with the same name, so this is not ideal. I made an effort to validate all data on load, but it would be great if we could improve this somehow - either by storing the settings based on some wallet identity signature, or by storing the state in the wallet database (however that doesn't seem accessible via the interfaces::Wallet API). Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

          "title": "sqlite: Disallow writing from multiple `SQLiteBatch`s",
          "body": "The way that we have configured SQLite to run means that only one database transaction can be open at a time. Typically, each individual read and write operation will be its own transaction that is opened and committed automatically by SQLite. However, sometimes we want these operations to be batched into a multi-statement transaction, so `SQLiteBatch::TxnBegin`, `SQLiteBatch::TxnCommit`, and `SQLiteBatch::TxnAbort` are used to manage the transaction of the database.\r\n\r\nHowever, once a db transaction is begun with one `SQLiteBatch`, any operations performed by another `SQLiteBatch` will also occur within the same transaction. Furthermore, those other `SQLiteBatch`s will not be expecting a transaction to be active, and will abort it once the `SQLiteBatch` is destructed. This is problematic as it will prevent some data from being written, and also cause the `SQLiteBatch` that opened the transaction in the first place to be in an unexpected state and throw an error.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this situation, we need to prevent the multiple batches from writing at the same time. Although SQLite does have facilities for doing that, they require the Write Ahead Log (WAL) mode, which is a feature that we explicitly chose to disable since it spread wallet data to multiple files. As such, we need to be handling the concurrency ourselves. To do so, I've implemented added a `CSemaphore` within `SQLiteDatabase` which will be used by any `SQLiteBatch` trying to do a write operation. `wait()` is called by `TxnBegin`, and at the beginning of `WriteKey`, `EraseKey`, and `ErasePrefix`. `post()` is called in `TxnCommit`, `TxnAbort` and at the end of `WriteKey`, `EraseKey`, and `ErasePrefix`. To avoid deadlocking on ` TxnBegin()` followed by a `WriteKey()`, `SQLiteBatch will now also track whether a transaction is in progress so that it knows whether to use the semaphore.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not a problem for BDB wallets since BDB uses WAL and provides transaction objects that must be used if an operation is to occur within a transaction. Specifically, we either pass a transaction pointer, or a nullptr, to all BDB operations, and this allows for concurrent transactions so it doesn't have this problem.\r\n\r\nFixes #29110",

          "body": "This PR adds a `createwalletdescriptor` RPC which allows users to add new automatically generated descriptors to their wallet, e.g. to upgrade a 0.21.x wallet to contain a taproot descriptor. This RPC takes 3 arguments: the output type to create a descriptor for, whether the descriptor will be internal or external, and the HD key to use if the user wishes to use a specific key. The HD key is an optional parameter. If it is not specified, the wallet will use the key shared by the active descriptors, if they are all single key. For most users in the expected upgrade scenario, this should be sufficient. In more advanced cases, the user must specify the HD key to use.\r\n\r\nCurrently, specified HD keys must already exist in the wallet. To make it easier for the user to know, `gethdkeys` is also added to list out the HD keys in use by all of the descriptors in the wallet. This will include all HD keys, whether we have the private key, for it, which descriptors use it and their activeness, and optionally the extended private key. In this way, users with more complex wallets will be still be able to get HD keys from their wallet for use in other scenarios, and if they want to use `createwalletdescriptor`, they can easily get the keys that they can specify to it.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1866961865",

These can be imported into the wallet, and subsequently retrieved with `gethdkeys`. Additionally, `listdescriptors` will output these descriptors so that they can be easily backed up.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it easier for people to add HD keys to their wallet, and to generate a new one if they want to rotate their descriptors, an `addhdkey` RPC is also added. Without arguments, it will generate a new HD key and add it to the wallet via a `void(KEY)` descriptor. If provided a private key, it will construct the descriptor and add it to the wallet.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1866961865\r\n\r\nBased on #29130 as `gethdkeys` is useful for testing this.",
