    "title": "descriptors: represent multiple derivation paths within one descriptor",
    "body": "It would be useful to express a full wallet of external and change scripts derived from the same xpub as one descriptor. Currently this requires two different descriptors where most of the descriptor is the same but only the derivation path at the end is different. So instead, one descriptor could contain multiple derivation paths following the xpub.\r\n\r\nI propose that we could use `{}` to contain the multiple derivation paths, separated by `,`. So it would look something like:\r\n```\r\nxpub...{0,1}/*\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\ncc @sipa ",

Specifically for Electrum's current HD wallets it would be a `m/0/i` (receive), `m/1/j` (change) hierarchy. To do this you however currently need two `KEY` expressions.\r\nI think basically all light wallets use this hierarchy atm (m/0/i, m/1/j), this is also what BIP44 uses.\r\n\r\nAs detailed in first link above, currently in Electrum when constructing a multisig wallet, cosigners share xpubs with each other; other contextual information such as number of required signers are selected in the GUI. To be able to construct an output script descriptor that describes a multisig where cosigners have key origin information for example, instead of xpubs, we could show `KEY` expressions to cosigners that they would share each other. The issue is HOW the cosigners are supposed to create the script descriptor.\r\n\r\nFor now, we would want to support at least the above described receive/change hierarchy, but with the current `KEY` expression syntax cosigners would need to be shown and then expected to share two of these. \r\n\r\nI know there are some undesirable properties of sharing these instead of the xpubs as now not the whole thing is checksummed, but the script descriptor needs to be constructed **somehow**. When looking at the output descriptors doc, I feel like this point has been considered completely out of scope so far, but it is a real UX issue.",

      "body": "+1 on @SomberNight's comments.  Collaborative multisig requires exchanging xpubs and then agreeing on how to derive & use addresses (script template, derivation paths, &c.).  If these decisions aren't tracked well, this \"contextual information\" becomes hidden state which frustrates users and developers alike.\r\n\r\nDescriptors are *almost* the perfect way to encode these decisions into a concise, robust, portable format.  The ability to specify multiple \"families\" of addresses for (say) receiving vs. change addresses would be extremely useful.\r\n\r\nOne can argue that multiple descriptors are just as good but practically they lack a shared checksum and aesthetically using to almost identical long strings to represent two related families seems wrong.  Related descriptors are extremely similar and differ merely in one derivation path segment.  It would be more natural for the descriptor definition to allow multiple wildcards `.../*/*` or constructs such as `.../{0,1}/*` to enable this use case.",

          "body": "Multiple people, or even just one person with multiple devices, want to setup a multi-sig wallet. The end result is a [descriptor wallet](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16528), perhaps [miniscript enhanced](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16800).\r\n\r\nProblem: how do you coordinate this setup? See Electrum thread about the same issue: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/5715\r\n\r\nBonus points: it should also work with a protocol like MuSig that requires more than one round of communication.\r\n\r\n## Current situation\r\n\r\nI made a [tutorial and screencast](https://nthkey.com/tutorial) of a setup flow, in this case using two signers: a ColdCard  and an iOs app that I'm working on. It's based on the flow ColdCard uses to setup a multisig between two of their devices. [Specter wallet](https://github.com/cryptoadvance) uses a similar flow and the same file format, last time I checked.\r\n\r\nThe general idea there is for each cosigner to export a (JSON) file with information about their public keys, and for the other signers to import that. Derivation paths are standardised (see also #16895). All participating devices will derive the same addresses; the user just needs to enter the (same) threshold on all devices.\r\n\r\nThe above is pretty easy to implement.\r\n\r\n## Flexible signer policies\r\n\r\nThe above approach requires everyone to contribute a single key. Individual participants can't do fancy stuff like having their own internal multisig setup or some backup key after a timeout. Yet this could be very useful, e.g. imagine a user with two hardware wallets who wants to use an external service provider as the third key. That service provider may have some super fancy setup, but they don't want to ship custom software to the user, let alone merge their special sauce into Bitcoin Core. What if you could use the Green Address service, but with your favourite orange QT wallet?\r\n\r\nA more flexible setup could use miniscript, where each participant provides a policy language snippet they want to use. These are then aggregated with `thresh(M, policy1, policy2, ... policyN)`. The result is then compiled by a coordinator (one of the participants) and shared with the others. Each participant could use a simple public key, or some super convoluted scheme. The cool thing about miniscript if that each participant can verify, without understanding the policy of the others, that they indeed control 1/Nth.\r\n\r\nIIUC the plan is to [combine](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16800) the powers of miniscript and output descriptors, and eventually add that to the wallet. Hopefully this allows for putting xpubs and origin info in both the policy language and the miniscript itself.\r\n\r\nThere is no current plan to add the policy language to miniscript compiler to Bitcoin Core, but we can start with a naive concatenation of participant miniscripts. Also AFAIK existing hardware wallets don't support anything other than plain OP_CHECKMULTISIG (`thresh_m(2, xpub1, xpub2, xpub3))` anyway.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we would use future proof syntax like the policy language, but in practice \"compile\" only to trivial, non-optimized, miniscript(s) that match what we can already do with descriptors.\r\n\r\n## Wallet composer file?\r\n\r\nWhat I have in mind is to (wait for someone else to) design a (binary) format, perhaps similar to PSBT, to compose a wallet interactively.\r\n\r\nIt would start with a coordinator. They populate the file with the \"shape\" of the wallet (YAML for illustrative purposes): \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- descriptor: null\r\n- policy: thresh(2, participant_1, participant_2, participant_3))\r\n- participant_1:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n- participant_2:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n- participant_3:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the first participant, probably the coordinator, fills in their details. They can also list their (advanced) capabilities, e.g. if they're able to decompile miniscript or only understand very basic policies.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- descriptor: null\r\n- policy: thresh(2, participant_1, participant_2, participant_3))\r\n- participant_1:\r\n   - policy: c:pk([00000000]/m/48h/0h/0h/2h/xpub_1/{0,1}/*)\r\n   - can_decompile_miniscript: false\r\n- participant_2:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n- participant_3:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe file is then passed to participants 2 and 3. Participant 3 will have all the info it needs to construct a final descriptor (set), and it can prompt the user to \"commit\" to that wallet:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- descriptor: multi(2, [00000000]/m/48h/0h/0h/2h/xpub_1/{0,1}/*, ......)\r\n- policy: ...\r\netc...\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`{0,1}` is a fake descriptor syntax; for now you need a separate receive and change descriptor)\r\n\r\nEach participant needs to \"commit\" to the wallet, in the sense of storing it in their memory. This lets them display receive addresses, and it lets them check the change address before signing a transaction.\r\n\r\nIt then passes it to the other participants. If the devices all have screens, the user can now compare the first receive address as a sanity check.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core should be able to import this a watch-only descriptor wallet (or maybe it has one of the keys).\r\n\r\nIf any of the devices isn't smart / powerful enough to figure out the descriptor, then it needs to go back to the coordinator first. Conversely you could start with a round where each participant announces their capabilities (support for lock times, if they can decompile miniscript and understand their role in the top policy, taproot support, resource limits, etc). A coordinator can then propose a top level policy based on that.\r\n\r\nAdditional fields can be added e.g. to include nonces for a musig pubkey generation ritual. Also additional fields could contain friendly names for the participants.\r\n\r\nIdeally the whole thing is small enough to copy-paste or put in a QR code (e.g. bech32-ish encoded).",

      "body": "In the BitBox02, we have arrived at using one descriptor at the account level. Change and receive addresses (scripts) are simply assumed to be at ./1/* and ./0/*, as derived from the xpubs given in the multisig descriptor.\r\n\r\nWe also register the multisig setup in the device. Having one descriptor correspond to one multisig account makes things easier than to register multiple descriptors (one for receive, one for change), as the user has to verify less data. Backup is also simplified - one descriptor is easier to backup and restore than two.\r\n\r\nSince pretty much every wallet deals with changes and receive addresses in this way, I don't see it as very useful track two separate descriptors, or even to put two separate derivation paths into one descriptor. Sounds easiest to stick to the convention of ./1/* and ./0/* for change and receive addresses.",

          "body": "There has been incredible work implementing descriptor wallets, PSBTs, offline signing, HWWs; and GUI support for it all into Bitcoin Core.  It has been incredibly exciting to watch!\r\n\r\nMy goal is to financially support developers to implement offline multisignature wallets into Bitcoin Core.  I believe we are almost there.\r\n\r\nI am here to humbly try to attempt to describe what I see, as a user and through talks with other developers, as the work that is needed to implement secure, offline multisignature wallets in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n1) A standard for Coordinating Multisignature Wallets, with an authentication scheme.  This is being discussed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18142).\r\n\r\nBlockchainCommons has done a lot of work around this:\r\n\r\nOnline Node Coordinator sends a 'Policy Request' to Offline Co-Signers, if acceptable, co-signers send a 'Keyset', and then get an 'Account Map' back.\r\n\r\nPolicy Request = empty descriptor\r\n\r\nKeyset = BIP48 path\r\n\r\nAccount Map = descriptor w/ no xprvs in it\r\n\r\nAND/OR\r\n\r\nCo-Signers send array of descriptors for all script types ([BCR-2020-015](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-015-account.md)) to Coordinator, Coordinator selects necessary descriptor and creates wallet, then sends 'Account Map' back.\r\n\r\nConcerns:  lack of complete standardization.  use of BIP48.  Names still up in the air.\r\n\r\n@Sjors also discussed the possibility of a 'Wallet Composer File' that could compose a wallet interactively, use future-proof syntax (can the signer decompile miniscript?), and support other capabilities.  Not sure how much work has been done on this.\r\n\r\n1 A)  The authentication:\r\n\r\nJust trust on first use, with warnings if data changes?  @benma has done great research and reporting on this:\r\n\r\nTo receive securely, the offline signers need to be able to verify the following:\r\n\r\n> The receive address, which has to encode the hash of an ordinary multisig redeem script with no other spending conditions\r\n> The key of the hardware wallet, which has to be one of the public keys in the redeem script\r\n> The keypath of the displayed address in order to avoid ransom attacks if no restrictions are enforced by the hardware wallet\r\n> The number of cosigners in order to prevent an attacker from adding more\r\n> The threshold of required signatures to not be higher or lower than intended\r\n> The xpubs of the cosigners in order to prevent an attacker from swapping them\r\n\r\nThe above is written for hardware wallets, but I believe any BIP written and code implemented should be for both HWWs and offline Core wallets.  With descriptor wallets, I believe a lot of the above authentication can be automated by the info in the Account Map that all offline co-signers have.\r\n\r\nTo send securely, the offline signers need to be able to verify the following:\r\n\r\n> The recipient’s address, displayed and confirmed by the user like with singlesig\r\n> The change address, having the same cosigners and threshold in an ordinary multisig script with no other spending conditions\r\n> The change goes to an address at a keypath recoverable by the user\r\n\r\nI think all the above is very important, since there have been many instances of devices not properly implementing the above security measures, so having a BIP for devices/software to comply with would be important.\r\n\r\n\r\n@Sjors and @achow101 have been doing a ton of work integrating HWWs.  This looks like it will be merged soon: (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16546).  After that, the UI will be worked on (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/4), and there is a currently-closed PR for HWW multisig functionality on top (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16895).  Perhaps some of this code can be re-used for multisig with Core on offline computers, but I am not sure.\r\n\r\nI believe having this ability would be an extensive security gain (being able to create a multisig wallet with Core on offline computers through the GUI).\r\n\r\n\r\n2)  Represent multiple derivation paths with one descriptor (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190)\r\n\r\nSingle descriptors make creating, backing up, and restoring multisignature wallets much simpler.  For example:\r\n\r\nTo create a multisignature wallet in Bitcoin Core, you can currently:\r\n\r\n1. Create wallet\r\n2. Dump `hdseed`\r\n3. Create address, dump xpriv\r\n4. Repeat Steps 1-3 N times\r\n5. Create multisig wallet using descriptor containing all N xprvs (M of N multisig)\r\n6. Use the N `hdseed`s along with Account Map as backup\r\n\r\nHowever, the above wallet can not create change addresses.  You need to create (backup and restore) a second descriptor for change addresses, even though most of the descriptor is the same, except for the derivation path at the end.  This can be very time consuming/confusing for end users, especially when backing up by paper/hand.\r\n\r\nFor a comprehensive offline multisignature wallet, I believe this change needs to be implemented.  Currently in Yeti, we bypass this by recommending coin control and only sending entire UTXO's (which is a pretty bad user experience and short term solution we have chosen).\r\n\r\nSome users like setting custom change descriptors (for example, for sending to an application for mixing change) so I believe this should be able to be done behind expert options, and perhaps this makes a single descriptor less controversial.\r\n\r\n\r\n3)  QR code scanner (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/9913)\r\n\r\nQR codes are the most secure way to pass data between airgapped signers.  I currently have a $300 bounty on implementing this.  BlockchainCommons has a standard ([BCR-2020-005](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md)) that is compatible with PSBTs (multiple QR codes checksummed; or a single animated QR code), and has a C++ reference implementation (https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur).\r\n\r\n\r\n4)  After the above (1-3) is finished, I believe implementing offline multisignature wallets into Bitcoin Core will be possible.\r\n\r\nI am not trying to influence consensus (this should just be wallet code), and ultimately it is of course up to the developers and the community if these are changes that are good for Bitcoin, and if the above is how it should be implemented.  I am just trying to put all the thoughts/discussions down in one place.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopers who might be interested:\r\n\r\n@Sjors @gwillen @instagibbs @achow101 \r\n\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nI, Robert Spigler, am offering a $1,500 bounty for implementing 1, 2, 3, and 4 (standard for coordination of co-signers, single descriptors, QR codes, and offline multisignature wallets) in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nThis does not include the already existing $300 bounty for #3 (QR codes).\r\n\r\nThe bounty will be split between developers as I see most fair (author and substantial reviews/discussions).\r\n\r\nThe bounty has no expiration and will be paid in bitcoin.\r\n\r\nThe date is 2021-02-02.\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n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\r\nYGS81OAQfIV/MJFffSJ581uU6th1s+7g9nWjeT9vGqTSJbNd1P4=\r\n=Xm2a\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n",

Within private or semi-private discussions, people said that they like the idea, noted the usefulness of this format and having it standardized. I attribute the lack of public discussions to the template format being boring but practical, and thus uncontroversial. I think that having this as a formal standard will be a benefit to the Bitcoin-related software and hardware ecosystem. I hope that submitting this as PR will bring more discussion and comments.\r\n\r\nThere are three implementations, including two reference implementations: in C and in Python (that is also compatible with micropython to be suitable for embedded applications). The implementations are thoroughly tested with the test data generated from the formal specification, and thus their behaviour follows the formal spec closely.\r\n\r\nMy thanks to @Enegnei for the help in fixing grammatical and punctuation errors in the early draft.\r\n\r\n",

I don't think so.\r\n  - Share it with the other participants.\r\n- Second phase: Every participant imports the following descriptors using `importdescriptors`:\r\n  - Receiving  (`internal: false`) addresses are `wsh(sortedmulti(<M>,xpubA/0/*,xpubB/0/*,xpubC/0/*,…))`\r\n  - Change (`internal: true`) addresses are `wsh(sortedmulti(<M>,xpubA/1/*,xpubB/1/*,xpubC/1/*,…))`\r\n- Send funds to the resulting address (every participant should get the same addresses).\r\n- When making a sending transaction create one using `walletcreatefundedpsbt` (everyone can initiate this)\r\n  - Send the resulting PSBT to other users\r\n  - At least M users checks it with `decodepsbt` then (if ok) signs it with `walletprocesspsbt`\r\n  - Collect the signed PSBTs with `joinpsbts` then broadcast the resulting transaction\r\n",

      "body": "Another question that was posed to me recently was why do we even have split derivation paths in the first place? It seems to me that there isn't really an advantage to having receiving and change addresses be separated. If anything, it is creating more of a problem because it makes backups harder. Unless there is a strong reason to continue to use separate receiving and change descriptors, I think the entire ecosystem should move away from this separation. That would make this entire issue moot.\r\n\r\nFrom reading BIP 32, it seems like the primary reason for recommending split key chains is to allow for an xpub to be given out to people (for some reason) but still maintain some privacy about funds that were sent to change. I don't think xpubs are shared publicly, and there are known issues with unhardened derivation, so I don't think this is a valid use case anymore.",

However, in the consolidated case, if the user had made a transaction that had a change output in the time between giving out unused addresses and restoring, then the change address would be marked as used, and that would mark all of the addresses up to that change address as being used, and if those were ones given out but unused, then there is no possibility for the user to accidentally reuse those addresses.

So this shouldn't be a problem.

So this shouldn't be a problem. Even when restoring a wallet, it is obvious which outputs are change through inspection, and restored wallets already have to be doing that to figure out what index to start new addresses at.\r\n\r\nThe BitBoxApp, and most other wallets I looked at (e.g. Electrum), use the derivation path to determine which outputs are change and which aren't. How exactly would it be obvious when restoring a wallet which outputs are change if they are not derived on separate derivation paths?\r\n\r\nKnowing which outputs are change is important for the wallet to function properly, e.g. to display the correct balance.\r\n",

      "body": "Thinking on BIP 88 (and this idea in general), it seems like having multiple possible derivation paths starts to break down once you get past the basic change and not change aspects, and especially when there are multiple keys and different derivation path patterns.\r\n\r\nIn a single key case, this is pretty obvious, it just becomes a lot of descriptors. So something like\r\n\r\n    wpkh(xpub.../{0-10}/{0-1}/*\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n    wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)\r\n    wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)\r\n    wpkh(xpub.../1/0/*)\r\n    wpkh(xpub.../1/1/*)\r\n    wpkh(xpub.../2/0/*)\r\n    wpkh(xpub.../2/1/*)\r\n    ... etc.\r\n\r\nBut if there are multiple keys, such as in multisigs, it gets a bit more complicated. For example\r\n\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../{0-1}/*, xpub.../{0-1}/*)\r\n\r\nTo fit with the expectation of change and not change, this would become\r\n\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../0/*, xpub.../0/*)\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../1/*, xpub.../1/*)\r\n\r\nrather than\r\n\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../0/*, xpub.../0/*)\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../0/*, xpub.../1/*)\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../1/*, xpub.../0/*)\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../1/*, xpub.../1/*)\r\n\r\nBut maintaining this pattern for change and not change doesn't quite work if there are multiple of these multipath expressions as BIP 88 allows. For example, how would\r\n\r\n    multi(2,xpub.../48h/0h/{0,1}/*,xpub.../48h/{0-10}/{0,1})`\r\n\r\nbe expanded?\r\n\r\nSo I think perhaps this is not a tenable solution, or it may result in expansions that contain unexpected descriptors. I suppose one method is to just limit this syntax to single key descriptors, but then it isn't quite as useful, and I would prefer to have Key expressions which don't have special syntaxes that only work for certain descriptors.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nInstead of a generic solution like BIP 88, we could implement a specific solution for just the receive and change issue. Perhaps a special path index `{r,c}` that is allowed to appear once per path. `r` is the path to use for receiving addresses, and `c` is the path to use for change addresses. This works for descriptors with multiple keys as this would become two descriptors, one with only the `r` indexes, and one with only the `c` indexes. Since only one is allowed per path specifier, there is no issue with multiple path specifiers as BIP 88 would have. In the common case, it would still be written as `{0,1}`, but other derivation paths could be used for `r` and `c` if desired.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../{0,1}/*, xpub.../{2,3}/*)\r\n\r\nwould become\r\n\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../0/*, xpub.../2/*)\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../1/*, xpub.../3/*)",

So there is no way to examine the transaction during restore and differentiate b/w send to self and change? (without separate descriptors).

I don't believe BIP129 would currently support multiple accounts per signer, as it would require multiple signatures per key record.\r\n\r\nI like your `{r,c}` proposal, because then it is explicit about how something like your example of :\r\n\r\n`multi(2, xpub.../{0-1}/*, xpub.../{0-1}/*)` is to be expanded\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> Interesting. So there is no way to examine the transaction during restore and differentiate b/w send to self and change? (without separate descriptors).\r\n\r\nThe only case where I think it would be obvious is when the transaction does not have any change. So a tx that spends inputs from the wallet and creates a single output also owned by the wallet can be assumed to be a send to self. But if there is a change (so 2 outputs to self), then we cannot distinguish which is for change and which is the send to self without checking which descriptor was used to generate each address.\r\n\r\n> Could this be marked by metadata?\r\n\r\nYes, and it is. But that doesn't apply when restoring a wallet.\r\n\r\n> Re: BIP88:\r\n> \r\n> I don't believe multisigs would have multi-account path expressions (at least when BIP88 is used with [BIP87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki) and [BIP129](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki)) - or atleast that was my understanding.\r\n> \r\n> How would `wsh(sortedmulti(2,[xfpForA/87'/0'/0']XpubA/{0,1}/*,[xfpForB/87'/0'/0']XpubB/{0,1}/*))` work if one of the participants had a BIP88 account range of `{0,10}`? I don't believe BIP129 would currently support multiple accounts per signer, as it would require multiple signatures per key record.\r\n\r\nWithin the framework of existing BIPs, this scenario is probably not possible. But we can't just think within what already exists. We have to think about all of the other weird stuff that could happen. So that means considering what could happen if a descriptor had multiple multi-path specifiers with multiple keys in the descriptor. That would still be BIP 88 valid, and I don't think the way to expand that would work well with what people actually want.\r\n",

          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",

      "body": "_Maybe I'm showing my inexperience, but here it goes..._\r\n\r\nI'm reviewing #22838 and don't really like the idea of making descriptors more complex than they already are (and to me this seems like a narrow use-case that is already pretty straightforward to do with descriptors as-is). So it's not like we're gaining extra functionality with this change.\r\n\r\nFrom my view, in its current form, multipath descriptors would add more complexity to make the UX feel nice/\"correct\", but is really putting makeup on some (weird?) underlying design decisions: why do we need this convention of derivation paths at `{xpub}/0/*` and `{xpub}/1/*` to differentiate between receiving and change (`internal`) addresses? Since pretty much every wallet deals with changes and receive addresses in this way, couldn't we just always consider even paths `range_index % 2 == 0` (ie `{xpub}/0/0`, `{xpub}/0/2`, ...) receiving,  and odd indexes (`{xpub}/0/1`, `{xpub}/0/3`, ...) change/`internal`?  I don't see how this imposes any limitations or additional complexity, and seems to fit better with the boolean nature of `internal == true/false`. At that point we have one **simple** descriptor, and I think this aligns more with what users would actually expect to see (why would they need to do anything extra to handle change? Even a multipath `<0;1>` in the descriptor is extra, and seems like unnecessary details for pretty much everyone but those working on the implementation of descriptor wallets).\r\n\r\nReading through the descriptor/wallet code, I don't understand why we need both:\r\n```c++\r\nstd::map<OutputType, ScriptPubKeyMan*> m_external_spk_managers;\r\nstd::map<OutputType, ScriptPubKeyMan*> m_internal_spk_managers;\r\n```\r\nThe differentiation between the two doesn't make much sense to me, as it seems to just come down to \"when we receive to this address do we show it as an incoming transaction, or is this just change from a send we did?\" So I'm also wondering if there's an opportunity to simplify/refactor code instead of make it more complicated.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how entrenched these conventions are, or maybe I'm missing some implementation details that make my idea impractical. Please lmk!\r\n\r\nReading through the discussion here, @benma seemed to have somewhat similar thoughts as me, and took an approach that wouldn't require any changes to core (although my idea would involve a deprecation process and refactor):\r\n> Since pretty much every wallet deals with changes and receive addresses in this way, I don't see it as very useful track two separate descriptors, or even to put two separate derivation paths into one descriptor. Sounds easiest to stick to the convention of ./1/* and ./0/* for change and receive addresses.",

For example, it may be desirable to have change addresses use a hardened derivation path while receiving addresses are unhardened.\r\n\r\nIt is important to keep in mind that this is not really to deal with the default/usual case and pattern (i.e. the descriptors that the wallet will generate) but rather with unusual and custom descriptors that advanced users may want to use. The name of the game is flexibility.\r\n\r\n> From my view, in its current form, multipath descriptors would add more complexity to make the UX feel nice/\"correct\", but is really putting makeup on some (weird?) underlying design decisions: why do we need this convention of derivation paths at `{xpub}/0/*` and `{xpub}/1/*` to differentiate between receiving and change (`internal`) addresses?

      "body": "Thanks for the explanation, makes sense and gets me close to a Concept/Approach ack. One last thought, hopefully this either crosses the idea out or lets me know if it's worth looking into more:\r\n\r\nIf we were to implement the \"rule\":\r\n- even derivation paths `range_index % 2 == 0` (ie `{xpub}/*/0`, `{xpub}/*/2`, ...) are **always** receiving\r\n- odd paths (ie `{xpub}/*/1`, `{xpub}/*/3`, ...) are **always** change/internal\r\n\r\nI would think there's a way to do this that doesn't limit flexibility or have significant downsides. Let's say we add an RPC option: `include_change`\r\n\r\nThen, going with the multisig example from #22067:\r\n```python\r\nmultisig = node.get_wallet_rpc(f\"{self.name}_{i}\")\r\nexternal = multisig.getdescriptorinfo(f\"wsh(sortedmulti({self.M},{f'/0/*,'.join(xpubs)}/0/*))\")\r\ninternal = multisig.getdescriptorinfo(f\"wsh(sortedmulti({self.M},{f'/1/*,'.join(xpubs)}/1m/*))\").  # hardened\r\nresult = multisig.importdescriptors([\r\n  {  # receiving addresses (internal: False)\r\n      \"desc\": external[\"descriptor\"],\r\n      \"internal\": False,\r\n      \"include_change\": False,\r\n  }\r\n  { # change addresses (internal: True)\r\n      \"desc\": internal[\"descriptor\"],\r\n      \"internal\": True,\r\n      \"include_change\": False,\r\n   },\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this shows that since `include_change` is `False` we can still accomplish this with two descriptors, same as before. This highlights that it's still simple to have a completely different descriptor for change as well as a different derivation path.\r\n\r\nBut, we could also now do:\r\n```python\r\nmultisig = node.get_wallet_rpc(f\"{self.name}_{i}\")\r\ndescriptor = multisig.getdescriptorinfo(f\"wsh(sortedmulti({self.M},{f'/0/*,'.join(xpubs)}/0/*))\")\r\nresult = multisig.importdescriptors([\r\n  {  # both change and receiving addresses\r\n      \"desc\": descriptor[\"descriptor\"],\r\n      \"include_change\": True,  # maybe this defaults to `True` to make it even more intuitive for the average user?\r\n  },\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo me, it seems this is a win in terms of UX (even when compared to multipath descriptors in many cases). And may allow us to simplify some of the wallet / signer / descriptor code. It also may be a solid convention in general to build on for the wallet ecosystem?\r\n\r\nImportant to note, that even when `include_change` is `False`, receiving addresses will only ever use even paths and change/internal will only use odd paths. So the derivation paths actually used in the `range` is only ever half utilized as (even/odd paths are skipped over depending on receiving/change). But I don't see a practical reason that would be a problem.\r\n\r\nEither way I'll definitely be finishing my review of #22838 and have some ideas how I want to test it. But it's a pretty heavy change so I want to push back and make it's the best way forward",

      "body": "I tend to agree with @craigraw that receive/change is a common and old enough pattern to warrant a special case. And having paper backups of the full string is useful, and a big reason why we bothered with a checksum in the first place. This could be done implicitly though, by only communicating the receive descriptor. But it seems much safer to slightly complicate the descriptor standard to add support for `n` derivation paths.\r\n\r\nThe `<NUM;NUM>` format used in #22838, or the `{NUM,NUM}` format above, can trivially be expanded to arbitrary length later. If constraining it to 2 items for now makes implementations easier, that's fine by me.\r\n\r\nOne thing to consider is the question of whether we should leave unused characters alone for future use. Any descriptor parser already needs to be significantly smarter than just looking for the presence of a specific character, so it probably doesn't matter what we pick here. That said, I don't find the argument for the current choice in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22838#issuecomment-930374136 particularly strong. And it seems several wallets have already jumped the gun on `<NUM;NUM>`.\r\n\r\nAs for multiple accounts: I think it's OK for users and wallet software to treat those as separate wallets. You probably wouldn't want to import multiple accounts into a single Bitcoin Core wallet, since it won't segregate the funds. So I can live with not having a nested version of this. But again it seems possible to add that later, without making the syntax too atrocious. That may actually be an argument in favor of `< ;` over `{ ,`, since it won't be ambiguous with `multi()`.",

The existing `combo()` function doesn't fit the bill as it covers too much (e.g. legacy P2PK) and too little (no P2TR?),  they are at one pubkey (not BIP44-compatible) and its specification can change over time, while descriptors should remain static.",

          "body": "The current descriptor parsing fuzz target requires valid public or private keys to be provided. This is unnecessary as we are only interested in fuzzing the descriptor parsing logic here (other targets are focused on fuzzing keys serializations). And it's pretty inefficient, especially for formats that need a checksum (`xpub`, `xprv`, WIF).\r\n\r\nThis introduces a new target that mocks the keys as an index in a list of precomputed keys. Keys are represented as 2 hex characters in the descriptor. The key type (private, public, extended, ..) is deterministically based on this one-byte value. Keys are deterministically generated at target initialization. This is much more efficient and also largely reduces the size of the seeds.\r\nTL;DR: for instance instead of requiring the fuzzer to generate a `pk(xpub6DdBu7pBoyf7RjnUVhg8y6LFCfca2QAGJ39FcsgXM52Pg7eejUHLBJn4gNMey5dacyt4AjvKzdTQiuLfRdK8rSzyqZPJmNAcYZ9kVVEz4kj)` to parse a valid descriptor, it just needs to generate a `pk(03)`.\r\n\r\nNote we only mock the keys themselves, not the entire descriptor key expression. As we want to fuzz the real code that parses the rest of the key expression (origin, derivation paths, ..).\r\n\r\nThis is a target i used for reviewing #17190 and #27255, and figured it was worth PR'ing on its own since the added complexity for mocking the keys is minimal and it could help prevent introducing bugs to the descriptor parsing logic much more efficiently.",
