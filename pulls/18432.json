          "body": "This PR is replaced by #27224 (because of a permissions issue it was closed and locked and couldn't be reopened)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #21353.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`7a05b1dee2f` refactor: Remove CAddressBookData::destdata](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18608/commits/7a05b1dee2fa68b32bfb19e273fb55a5b3836a3e)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is cleanup that doesn't change external behavior.\r\n\r\n- Removes awkward `StringMap` intermediate representation\r\n- Deals with receive request \"rr\" keys in walletdb.cpp instead of all over qt, wallet, and interfaces code\r\n- Deals with destination \"used\" keys in walletdb.cpp instead of all over wallet code\r\n- Adds test coverage\r\n- Reduces code (+85/-138 lines)\r\n- Reduces memory usage\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't change externally observable behavior. Internally, only change in behavior is that EraseDestData deletes directly from database because the `StringMap` is gone. This is more direct and efficient because it uses a single btree lookup and scan instead of multiple lookups\r\n\r\nMotivation for this cleanup is making changes like #18550, #18192, #13756 easier to reason about and less likely to result in unintended behavior and bugs\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

Currently the list of includes is not sorted, so developers that write tests and have `clang-format` installed will either have an unrelated change (sorting) included in their commit or they will have to manually undo the sort.\r\n\r\nThis pull preempts both issues by just sorting all includes in one commit.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that this is **NOT** a change to policy to enforce clang-format or any other developer guideline or process. Developers are free to use whatever tool they want, see also #18651.\r\n\r\nEdit: Also includes a commit to bump the copyright headers, so that the touched files don't need to be touched again for that.",
