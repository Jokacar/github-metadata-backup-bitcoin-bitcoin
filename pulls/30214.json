    "body": "This PR contains the first part of #28608, which tries to make assumeutxo code more maintainable, and improve it by not locking `cs_main` for a long time when the snapshot block is connected, and by deleting the snapshot validation chainstate when it is no longer used, instead of waiting until the next restart.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR are just refactoring. They make `Chainstate` objects self-contained, so for example, it is possible to determine what blocks to connect to a chainstate without querying `ChainstateManager`, and to determine whether a Chainstate is validated without basing it on inferences like `&cs != &ActiveChainstate()` or `GetAll().size() == 1`.\r\n\r\nThe PR also tries to make assumeutxo terminology less confusing, using \"current chainstate\" to refer to the chainstate targeting the current network tip, and \"historical chainstate\" to refer to the chainstate downloading old blocks and validating the assumeutxo snapshot. It removes uses of the terms \"active chainstate,\" \"usable chainstate,\" \"disabled chainstate,\" \"ibd chainstate,\" and \"snapshot chainstate\" which are confusing for various reasons.",

          "body": "The validation caches are currently setup independently from where the rest of the validation code is initialized. This makes their ownership semantics unclear. There is also no clear enforcement on when and in what order they need to be initialized. The caches are always initialized in the `BasicTestingSetup` although a number of tests don't actually need them.\r\n\r\nSolve this by moving the caches from global scope into the `ChainstateManager` class. This simplifies the usage of the kernel library by no longer requiring manual setup of the caches prior to using the `ChainstateManager`. Tests that need to access the caches can instantiate them independently.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis pull request is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).",

Transaction download logic refers to the process of deciding what transactions to request, download, and validate.[1]\r\nAll of the changes here should result in no behavior change.\r\n\r\nThere are several benefits to this interface, such as:\r\n- Unit test coverage and **F U Z Z I N G** for logic that currently isn't feasible to test as thoroughly (due to the code paths not being reachable through `PeerManager` without a ton of overhead) and/or currently only lightly tested through `assert_debug_log` ( :-1: ) in functional tests.\r\n    - See for example the `MempoolRejectedTx` test, where we can define a matrix of expected outcomes for each `TxValidationResult` and test them very easily.\r\n    - For fuzzing, see the `txdownloadman` and `txdownload_impl` targets.\r\n- When we add more functionality (e.g. package relay messages, more robust orphan handling), the vast majority of it will be within `TxDownloadManager` instead of `PeerManager`, making it easier to review and test.\r\n- A thinner and easier-to-use interface for `PeerManager`, which will no longer know anything about / have access to `TxOrphanage` or rejection caches. Its primary interface with `TxDownloadManager` would be:\r\n    - Notify `txdownloadman` of tip changes (i.e. passing on some `ValidationInterface` callbacks)\r\n    - Tell `txdownloadman`when a {transaction, package} is {accepted, rejected} from mempool, and receive a few instructions\r\n    - Each time a peer connects or disconnects + sanity check functions during cleanup\r\n    - Pass transaction `inv`s, `notfound`s to `txdownloadman` and receive instructions on what to validate\r\n    - Get the `getdata` requests to send\r\n    - Get the transactions to reconsider in `ProcessOrphanTx`\r\n    - Get whether a peer `HaveMoreWork` for the `ProessMessages` loop\r\n    - ^note that there are some cleanups I still have to do, so it's not this clean yet, but this is the vision. For example, while I'm writing this, I plan to make `Find1P1CPackage` private to `TxDownloadImpl`\r\n    - ^in the future, it would also pass package-related messages on, and we would reuse the `PackageToValidate` struct to return the things `peerman` needs for validation.\r\n- (todo) with some more interface changes, we can make this manager internally thread-safe instead of having `PeerManager` handle it (e.g. currently it locks `cs_main` to synchronize accesses to `m_txrequest`!)\r\n\r\n[1]: This does not include transaction announcements, i.e. what we *send* to our peers. All of that happens after we download/accept a tx. Txreconciliation (erlay) is excluded from this module, as it is part of announcements and/or part of helping the other peer decide which `inv`s to send.",

As a result, this simplifies the `kernel::Notifications` interface.\r\n- removes warnings.cpp from the kernel library\r\n- removes warning globals\r\n- adds testing for the warning logic\r\n\r\nBehaviour change introduced:\r\n- the `-alertnotify` command is executed for all `KernelNotifications::warningSet` calls, which now also covers the `LARGE_WORK_INVALID_CHAIN` warning\r\n- the GUI is updated automatically whenever a warning is (un)set, covering some code paths where it previously wouldn't be, e.g. when `node::AbortNode()` is called, or for the `LARGE_WORK_INVALID_CHAIN` warning\r\n\r\nSome discussion points:\r\n- ~is `const std::string& id` the best way to refer to warnings? Enums are an obvious alternative, but since we need to define warnings across libraries, strings seem like a straightforward solution.~ _edit: updated approach to use `node::Warning` and `kernel::Warning` enums._",

          "title": "wallet: Avoid potentially writing incorrect best block locator",
          "body": "This PR updates the `CWallet::chainStateFlushed` method to write the `m_last_block_processed` locator to the database as the wallet's best block instead of the chain tip locator.\r\n\r\nSaving the last block processed locator as the best block is less fragile than saving `chainStateFlushed` locator as best block.\r\n\r\nRight now wallet code relies on `blockConnected` notifications being sent before `chainStateFlushed` notifications, and on the `chainStateFlushed` locator pointing to the last connected block. But this is a fragile assumption that can be easily broken by `ActivateBestChain`/`ConnectTrace` changes, and in fact is currently broken (since d96c59cc5cd2f73f1f55c133c52208671fe75ef3 from #25740) when the assumeutxo snapshot block is validated. In that case the background validation `chainStateFlushed` notification is sent _before_ the `blockConnected` notification so writing the locator as the best block would record a best block that was never processed. This specific change does not cause a problem for the wallet, because the wallet ignores events from the background validation chainstate. But nothing prevents similar out-of-order `chainStateFlushed` notifications from being sent in the future, so it is safer for the wallet to not rely on the chain tip sent in `chainStateFlushed` notifications.\r\n\r\nA good followup to this change would probably be to drop the `ChainStateFlushed` locator argument entirely so it is not misused in the future. Indexing code already stopped using this locator argument a long time ago for identifying the best block (in 4368384f1d267b011e03a805f934f5c47e2ca1b2 from #14121), though it is currently using the locator argument to log diagnostic warnings.",

These changes should also improve code organization and make functions easier to discover. Some of these same moves are (or were) part of #28690, but did not help with code organization, or made it worse, so it is better to move them and clean them up in the same PR so code only has to change one time.\r\n",

This PR makes the wallet UI safer by not rendering transactions as fully confirmed until the background validation is done.\r\n\r\nInstead it shows the same icon as when a transaction has 1 confirmation. This is quite conservative. The cost of tricking someone into accepting a fake coin, by giving them a invalid snapshot`*` and then mining a block on top of it, is higher than a regular doublespend by mining.\r\n\r\n![pending](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/10217/a2a95190-a1a7-402e-822b-b0829d5bdf45)\r\n\r\n`* =` in the current implementation this involves giving someone a malicious binary or getting them to recompile\r\n\r\nCaveat: because transaction state is updated after `blockConnected`, if you restart the node during background sync, then the transaction will show as fully confirmed (`\"assumed\": false`) briefly - until the next block is connected.",

          "title": "tracing: Only prepare tracepoint arguments when actually tracing",
          "body": "Currently, if the tracepoints are compiled (e.g. in depends and release builds), we always prepare the tracepoint arguments regardless of the tracepoints being used or not. We made sure that the argument preparation is as cheap as possible, but we can almost completely eliminate any overhead for users not interested in the tracepoints (the vast majority), by gating the tracepoint argument preparation with an `if(something is attached to this tracepoint)`. To achieve this, we use the optional semaphore feature provided by SystemTap.\r\n\r\nThe first commit simplifies and deduplicates our tracepoint macros from 13 TRACEx macros to a single TRACEPOINT macro. This makes them easier to use and also avoids more duplicate macro definitions in the second commit.\r\n\r\nThe Linux tracing tools I'm aware of (bcc, bpftrace, libbpf, and systemtap) all support the semaphore gating feature. Thus, all existing tracepoints and their argument preparation is gated in the second commit. For details, please refer to the commit messages and the updated documentation in `doc/tracing.md`.\r\n\r\nAlso adding unit tests that include all tracepoint macros to make sure there are no compiler problems with them (e.g. some varadiac extension not supported). \r\n\r\nReviewers might want to check:\r\n- Do the tracepoints still work for you? Do the examples in `contrib/tracing/` run on your system (as bpftrace frequently breaks on every new version, please test master too if it should't work for you)? Do the CI interface tests still pass?\r\n- Is the new documentation clear? \r\n- The `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE(event, context)` macros places global variables in our global namespace. Is this something we strictly want to avoid or maybe move to all `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE`s to a separate .cpp file or even namespace? I like having the `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE()` in same file as the `TRACEPOINT()`, but open for suggestion on alternative approaches. \r\n- Are newly added tracepoints in the unit tests visible when using `readelf -n /src/test/test_bitcoin`? You can run the new unit tests with `./src/test/test_bitcoin --run_test=util_trace_tests* --log_level=all`.\r\n<details><summary>Two of the added unit tests demonstrate that we are only processing the tracepoint arguments when attached by having a test-failure condition in the tracepoint argument preparation. The following bpftrace script can be used to demonstrate that the tests do indeed fail when attached to the tracepoints.</summary>\r\n\r\n`fail_tests.bt`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bpftrace\r\n\r\nusdt:./src/test/test_bitcoin:test:check_if_attached {\r\n  printf(\"the 'check_if_attached' test should have failed\\n\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nusdt:./src/test/test_bitcoin:test:expensive_section {\r\n  printf(\"the 'expensive_section' test should have failed\\n\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the unit tests with `./src/test/test_bitcoin` and start `bpftrace fail_tests.bt -p $(pidof test_bitcoin)` in a separate terminal. The unit tests should fail with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning 594 test cases...\r\ntest/util_trace_tests.cpp(31): error: in \"util_trace_tests/test_tracepoint_check_if_attached\": check false has failed\r\ntest/util_trace_tests.cpp(51): error: in \"util_trace_tests/test_tracepoint_manual_tracepoint_active_check\": check false has failed\r\n\r\n*** 2 failures are detected in the test module \"Bitcoin Core Test Suite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nThese links might provide more contextual information for reviewers:\r\n- [How SystemTap Userspace Probes Work by eklitzke](https://eklitzke.org/how-sytemtap-userspace-probes-work) (actually an example on Bitcoin Core; mentions that with semaphores \"the overhead for an untraced process is effectively zero.\")\r\n- [libbpf comment on USDT semaphore handling](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/blob/1596a09b5de2a50ab8d44218fc29b6d42f886305/src/usdt.c#L83-L92) (can recommend the whole comment for background on how the tracepoints and tracing tools work together)\r\n- https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/UserSpaceProbeImplementation#Semaphore_Handling",
