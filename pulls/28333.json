    "body": "Instead of constructing ScriptPubKeyMans with no data, and then loading data as we find it, we should gather everything first and then load it all on construction. If there actually is no data and we want to setup generation, then that should also occur in a constructor rather than afterwards.\r\n\r\nThis change is only applied to DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan and ExternalSignerScriptPubKeyMan, and should be done for any ScriptPubKeyMans added in the future. I don't think it's really worth it to do this for LegacyScriptPubKeyMan since it would make loading performance worse (or cause layer violations) and it's (supposed to be) going away soon.",

          "body": "## For reviewers\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to make reviewing a bit more sane, I'm breaking this up into a few smaller PRs, but will keep this one open as the parent PR and keep it rebased on the child PRs. The main purpose of having this PR is to track progress on child PRs and also have an easy way to compile `bitcoind` with both send and receive support for testing. Additionally, I'll be adding more functional tests to this PR since it's much easier to test when `bitcoind` can both send and receive.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122\r\n  - Implements the logic from BIP352 without any wallet code. This PR adds the necessary cryptographic functions and implements the logic needed for sending and scanning. This PR also includes the test vectors from the BIP as unit tests. Both the send and receive PRs have this as a dependency. In terms of priority, this PR should be reviewed first\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201\r\n  - Implements sending in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to send to a silent payment address, regardless of whether or not the wallet can receive silent payments\r\n  - Ready for review, but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28202\r\n  - Implements receiving in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to generate silent payment addresses and scan for silent payments, regardless of whether or not the wallet can send to a silent payment address\r\n  - Ready for review but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n\r\nFor the silent payments specification, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458\r\n\r\n## Overall\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the full silent payments scheme: sending and receiving. The following items are not covered in this PR and are intended for follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n* Adding labels for the receiver wallet\r\n* Full RPC coverage (only `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` are covered in this PR)\r\n* Light client support (vending the tweak data per block, either in an index or to serve to indexer, such as electrum server)\r\n* Add benchmarks to validate that there are no DoS concerns for doing silent payment verification for transactions in the mempool\r\n* External signer support (dependent on hardware wallets supporting silent payments)\r\n* More unit / functional test coverage\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24897. Below is a summary of the major changes:\r\n\r\n* Remove labels\r\n  * The original draft included labels, but this has been deferred for a later PR. Labels are not necessary for sending and receiving and there are still some open questions on how best to implement them in Bitcoin Core. Labels can also be added at any point by the receiver without requiring any changes from the sender\r\n* Remove indexes\r\n  * In the original draft, indexes were used when scanning for silent payments and when doing wallet rescans. This has been removed in favor of using `rev*.dat` files for rescanning. It may make sense to add an index in the future, but for the purpose of vending tweak data to light clients, which is still an open question\r\n* Update to implement the most current version of BIP352\r\n  * Since the original draft, there have been a few changes in the BIP which are reflected in the current PR. Most notably, using 33-byte compressed keys for the silent payment address (as opposed to X-only keys in the original draft) \r\n\r\nIt may be helpful for context to read through the discussions on #24897 , but ongoing review should happen in the relevant child PRs listed above.",

This is done in various places, such as `IsMine`, and helper functions for fetching a `ScriptPubKeyMan` and a `SolvingProvider`. This also has a bit of a performance impact on standard descriptor wallets, although less noticeable due to the small number of SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAs these functions are based on doing `IsMine` for each `ScriptPubKeyMan`, we can improve this performance by caching `IsMine` scriptPubKeys for all descriptors and use that to determine which `ScriptPubKeyMan` to actually use for those things. This cache is used exclusively and we no longer iterate the SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAlso added a benchmark for `IsMine`.",

          "body": "It is useful to have a RPC that can create and add the automatically generated descriptors (that are normally made during creation) to a wallet. This is especially useful when a new default descriptor has been implemented as it allows wallets created before that time to quickly and easily add that type of descriptor.\r\n\r\nIn particular, descriptor wallets created before Taproot was implemented can use the new `createwalletdescriptor` RPC in order to get a Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to keep the newly generated descriptor in line with the existing descriptors, this PR uses #26728 as it exposes a \"wallet extended key\" for us (in addition to upgrading wallets implemented prior to have a wallet xpub). The newly generated descriptors will use the \"wallet extended key\" stored in `CWallet` that PR adds.\r\n\r\n`createwalletdescriptor` is generic and so it can also be used with the other address types. Of course, it given the same wallet extended key, address type, and internal-ness, it will create the same descriptor. So some refactoring has been done in order to detect that the same descriptor is about to be created, and to avoid overwriting any existing descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo be able to use `createwalletdescriptor` with the other address types, we need a way to change the wallet extended key, and so `sethdseed` has been updated and enabled for descriptor wallets. As with legacy wallets, when called without parameters, it will generate a new random master key for the wallet. It can also take a xprv and set that as the master key. It still takes a BIP 32 seed as WIF or as hex as we do for legacy wallets. The seed will be transformed into and stored as a BIP 32 extended key. The latter is to give us greater compatibility with other wallets which often produce non-WIF HD seeds.",

It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",
