    "body": "Given that the use of a transaction's nVersion is always as an unsigned int, it doesn't make sense to store it as signed and then cast it to unsigned everywhere it is used and displayed.\r\n\r\nSince a few alternative implementations have recently been revealed to have made an error with this signedness that would have resulted in consensus failure, I think it makes sense for us to just make this always unsigned to make it clear that the version is treated as unsigned. This would also help us avoid future potential issues with signedness of this value.\r\n\r\nI believe that this is safe and does not actually change what transactions would or would not be considered both standard and consensus valid. Within consensus, the only use of the version in consensus is in BIP68 validation which was already casting it to uint32_t. Within policy, although it is used as a signed int for the transaction version number check, I do not think that this change would change standardness. Standard transactions are limited to the range [1, 2]. Negative numbers would have fallen under the < 1 condition, but by making it unsigned, they are still non-standard under the > 2 condition.\r\n\r\nUnsigned and signed ints are serialized and unserialized the same way so there is no change in serialization.",

          "body": "`struct` has many issues in messages.py:\r\n\r\n* For unpacking, it requires to specify the length a second time, even when it is already clear from the `f.read(num_bytes)` context.\r\n* For unpacking, it is designed to support a long format string and returning a tuple of many values. However, except for 3 instances in `messages.py`, usually only a single value is unpacked and all those cases require an `[0]` access.\r\n* For packing and unpacking of a single value, the format string consists of characters that may be confusing and may need to be looked up in the documentation, as opposed to using easy to understand self-documenting code.\r\n\r\nI presume the above issues lead to accidentally treat `msg_version.relay` as a \"signed bool\", which is fine, but confusing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFix all issues by using the built-in `int` helpers `to_bytes` and `from_bytes` via a scripted diff.\r\n\r\nReview notes:\r\n\r\n* `struct.unpack` throws an error if the number of bytes passed is incorrect. `int.from_bytes` doesn't know about \"missing\" bytes and treats an empty byte array as `int(0)`. \"Extraneous\" bytes should never happen, because all `read` calls are limited in this file. If it is important to keep this error behavior, a helper `int_from_stream(stream, num_bytes, bytes, byteorder, *, **kwargs)` can be added, which checks the number of bytes read from the stream.\r\n* For `struct.pack` and `int.to_bytes` the error behavior is the same, although the error messages are not identical.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> Slightly related to this PR: since this currently doesn't produce a warning, was it ever considered to enable `-Wsign-conversion`?\r\n\r\nI think it is a common convention to write `-1` as an alias for `std::numeric_limits<unsigned ...>::max()`. Also, I expect there will be many places where positive signed integers are sign-preserving converted to unsigned (and vice-versa). So enabling that compiler warning may not be possible without changing a lot more code.\r\n\r\nLuckily, if a sign isn't preserved at runtime, during the tests, the sanitizers will catch it.
