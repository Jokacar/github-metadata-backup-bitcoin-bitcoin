    "body": "I've implemented about 13 different fuzzers that each fuzz different parts of the Bitcoin core source code. Collectively these result in much more code coverage than ```src/test/test_bitcoin_fuzzy.cpp``` but are not exhaustive (yet).\r\n\r\nI could not find any issues despite running the fuzzers for a long time.\r\n\r\nIf you want it, I'll make a pull request. I'm also willing to work together with someone who has more intimate knowledge of the Bitcoin core source code to complement the current set of fuzzers.\r\n",

I've played around with different ways to extend the fuzzing coverage myself, so I'd be really interested in checking your stuff out and how you've attacked the problem.\r\n\r\nIf you are not yet ready to submit a proper pull request I'd be glad to take a look at it as-is. Just dump the code in its current state in a gist, repo or somewhere convenient for you and I'll figure out the rest :-)\r\n\r\nFor reference, see some previous discussions about improving Bitcoin fuzzing :\r\n* [tests] Add fuzz testing for BlockTransactions, BlockTransactionsRequest and CBlockHeaderAndShortTxIDs deserialization, #10409\r\n* [tests] Add libFuzzer support, #10440\r\n* [tests] Speed up fuzzing by ~200x when using afl-fuzz, #10415\r\n* Feature request: Make Bitcoin libFuzzer-friendly and consider integration into the OSS-Fuzz project, #10364",

      "body": "@laanwj I think @sipa raised a good point above that there might be benefits to have a separate binary for each fuzzer. In addition to avoid confusing the fuzzer (unnecessary re-use of fuzzing inputs between the fuzzers - just confirmed by @kcc! :-)) it has the benefit of making it more obvious when a given fuzzing session has reached a state where no new paths are found.\r\n\r\nWith the current \"first part of input data chooses the fuzzer\"-approach taken by `test_bitcoin_fuzzy` it is quite hard to see which fuzzers that are still hitting new paths (i.e. keep fuzzing!), and which have reached their max depth/\"max path count\" (i.e. consider stop fuzzing).\r\n\r\n+1 for splitting the fuzzers into one binary each\r\n\r\nGiven a one-binary-per-fuzzer setup it would be quite trivial to write a script that gives each fuzzer a running time of X time units each, and then measures the achieved coverage. Having this kind of fuzzer shootout would be quite fun and will probably increase the interest in writing Bitcoin fuzzers!\r\n\r\nAlso it would make it easy to measure the _incremental_ coverage gained from adding a new fuzzer which would be handy during fuzzing development.",

Now if we only could get Bitcoin onto Google's OSS-Fuzz infrastructure! :-)\r\n\r\nPersonally I fuzz Bitcoin and the Swift compiler 24/7 (see [results here](https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20author%3Apracticalswift%20is%3Amerged%20crasher%20)), but unfortunately I meet a very real budget constraint that forces me to choose wisely between fuzzing targets based on path discovery rate :-)\r\n\r\nWhen I have you here in this thread - I just wanted to take the time to send a huge thank you for libFuzzer and the sanitizers. Amazing tools! Really impressed by your work!",

[n1-highcpu-8](https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing#predefined_machine_types) (a VM with 8 cores and 7.2Gb RAM) will cost you 6c per hour ($44 per month). Other cloud compute vendors have comparable prices, AFAICT\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/google/fuzzer-test-suite/blob/master/tutorial/libFuzzerTutorial.md#distributed-fuzzing\r\n\r\n> Amazing tools! \r\n\r\nThank you!

If you compile with ```-DSIZETYPE_UINT16_T``` it uses ```uint16_t``` as the internal size type, so it doesn't require 4GB buffers but only 64K (the overflow threshold of uint16_t) buffers.

It's pointless to build 100 fuzzers by default that 99% of people won't use, people are already complaining that building the tests takes long. Bitcoin has a lot of code and (inter)dependencies and every extra linker invocation will add significant time to the build process. And we don't want to encourage building entirely without tests.",

A new **fuzz** package was introduced which contains all of the message harnesses.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Update the README with newer build instructions.\r\n\r\n- [x] Build script\r\n\r\n- [x] Update the go-fuzz fuzzing corpus to include support for the newer lnwire messages.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a fuzzing harness for each lnwire message so that things like correct encodings / signatures can be added and so the fuzzer doesn't get \"confused\".\r\n\r\nFuture Work:\r\n-  Flame graph tooling.\r\n\r\n-  Fuzz the `wtwire` messages.\r\n\r\n-  Add better corpus messages for increased code coverage.\r\n\r\n-  Add correct signatures / encodings in the harnesses and other things the fuzzer won't guess.\r\n\r\n-  Run for a long time.

      "body": "Hey @Dor1s great response.  I read a bit more about AFL specifically and gmaxwell's response is starting to make a bit more sense.  AFL suffers from a hash collision problem in the 64Kb shared_mem array (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/technical_details.txt) and I'm wondering if that is also another motivation to remove this one-fuzzer-for-all approach?  But it seems that getting rid of, say, ~20 edges/branches wouldn't really mitigate this problem at all if the execution traces are particularly deep (i.e. have lots of edges and therefore a potential for collision).  Removing the switch specifically to avoid collision doesn't seem to be much of a motivation - the real motivation would be to avoid confusing the fuzzer with erroneous feedback that's applied to the wrong messages.  What do you think?",

Enables high-level fuzzing of the P2P layer.\r\n\r\nAll code paths reachable from this fuzzer can be assumed to be reachable for an untrusted peer.\r\n\r\nSeeded from thin air (an empty corpus) this fuzzer reaches roughly 20 000 lines of code.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ make distclean\r\n$ ./autogen.sh\r\n$ CC=clang CXX=clang++ ./configure --enable-fuzz \\\r\n      --with-sanitizers=address,fuzzer,undefined\r\n$ make\r\n$ src/test/fuzz/process_message\r\n…\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorth noting about this fuzzing harness:\r\n* To achieve a reasonable number of executions per seconds the state of the fuzzer is unfortunately not entirely reset between `test_one_input` calls. The set-up (`FuzzingSetup` ctor) and tear-down (`~FuzzingSetup`) work is simply too costly to be run on every iteration. There is a trade-off to handle here between a.) achieving high executions/second and b.) giving the fuzzer a totally blank slate for each call. Please let me know if you have any suggestion on how to improve this situation while maintaining >1000 executions/second. \r\n* To achieve optimal results when using coverage-guided fuzzing I've chosen to create one specialised fuzzing binary per message type (`process_message_addr`, `process_message_block`, `process_message_blocktxn `, etc.) and one general fuzzing binary (`process_message`) which handles all messages types. The latter general fuzzer can be seeded with inputs generated by the former specialised fuzzers.\r\n\r\nHappy fuzzing friends!",

          "body": "Greetings secp256k1 developers and contributors,\r\n\r\nWe’re reaching out because your project is an important part of the open source ecosystem, and we’d like to invite you to integrate with our [fuzzing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing) service, [OSS-Fuzz]( https://opensource.googleblog.com/2016/12/announcing-oss-fuzz-continuous-fuzzing.html ). OSS-Fuzz is a free fuzzing infrastructure you can use to identify security vulnerabilities and stability bugs in your project. OSS-Fuzz will:\r\n\r\n- Continuously run at scale all the fuzzers you write.\r\n- Alert you when it finds issues.\r\n- Automatically close issues after they’ve been fixed by a commit.\r\n\r\nMany widely used [open source projects]( https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects ) like OpenSSL, FFmpeg, LibreOffice, and ImageMagick are fuzzing via OSS-Fuzz, which helps them find and remediate [critical issues]( https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?can=1&q=status%3AFixed%2CVerified+Type%3ABug%2CBug-Security+-component%3AInfra+ ). \r\n\r\nEven though typical integrations can be done in < 100 LoC, we have a [reward program]( https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/patch-rewards/ ) in place which aims to recognize folks who are not just contributing to open source, but are also working hard to make it more secure.\r\n\r\nWe want to stress that anyone who meets the eligibility criteria and integrates a project with OSS-Fuzz is eligible for a reward.\r\n\r\nIf you're not interested in integrating with OSS-Fuzz, it would be helpful for us to understand why—lack of interest, lack of time, or something else—so we can better support projects like yours in the future.\r\n\r\nIf we’ve missed your question in our [FAQ]( https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/faq/ ), feel free to reply or reach out to us at oss-fuzz-outreach@googlegroups.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nTommy\r\nOSS-Fuzz Team\r\n",

The fuzzer runs locally, and I have managed to get it running on oss-fuzz's infrastructure as well. I would suggest that continuous fuzzing is implemented into Argos via oss-fuzz. This will allow the current fuzzer as well as all future fuzzers continuously in search for bugs. \r\nContinuous fuzzing has been proven to find bugs over time. [A bug](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11045#issuecomment-323203253) took several CPU years of fuzzing to find. \r\n\r\nIf Argo is accepted into the oss-fuzz project and a bug is found, maintainers on the email list receive a detailed bug report. The service is offered free of charge with an implied expectation that the bugs are fixed, so that the resources spent on fuzzing Argo are put to good use.\r\n\r\nI will be glad to implement Argo into oss-fuzz. All I need are the email addresses to add to the mailing list of the bug reports. This list is public and can be changed at any time.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nFuzzing is a technique that has proven effective in find bugs including vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\nWe take two steps:\r\n\r\n1. I contribute my fuzzer here on Argos repository.\r\n2. An application to integrate into oss-fuzz is setup using the fuzzer on Argos own repository.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- Issue Author: Don't delete this message to encourage other users to support your issue! -->\r\n**Message from the maintainers**:\r\n\r\nIf you wish to see this enhancement implemented please add a 👍 reaction to this issue!

          "body": "Having different fuzz targets is useful to give the fuzzer a specific and well defined task to work on. This makes it also easier for developers to see what an individual fuzz test/target is doing. Moreover, the fuzzer might be more performant in finding new inputs because the input directory as well as the search space is smaller.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are also several downsides:\r\n\r\n* Limiting the overall search space the fuzzer can explore will make it impossible to reach coverage for the code paths that have been excluded.\r\n* Building numerous small fuzz targets, instrumenting them and linking them with debug symbols is costly in CPU time and disk space. A quick build is not only important for devs, but also for CI.\r\n\r\nSimilar to how the unit tests are compiled and linked into one binary, we could look into linking the fuzz targets into one binary. Individual targets could be selected with some kind of runtime argument.",
