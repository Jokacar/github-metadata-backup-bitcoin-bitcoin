    "title": "Proposal: Implement HD Address Generation Mechanism for Outgoing Transactions",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nHD addressing is just a system for generating new addresses from a single seed. Currently, it automatically generates new addresses only for incoming transactions. \r\n\r\nSuggestion/Question: Why not implement the same simple system of generating new addresses from a single seed for outgoing transactions? This could enhance privacy by automatically using a new sending address for each outgoing transaction, similar to how new receiving addresses are generated.\r\n\r\nTechnical perspective:\r\n1. For incoming transactions, HD addressing works by:\r\n- Receiving a transaction\r\n- Automatically generating a new address for the next receipt\r\n- Previous address is no longer shown to senders\r\n\r\n2. The proposed mechanism for outgoing transactions would work similarly:\r\n- When making an outgoing transaction\r\n- Automatically generate a new address for sending\r\n- Previous sending address would no longer be used\r\n\r\nThis mechanism seems technically feasible and could potentially improve transaction privacy. While understanding the current UTXO model constraints, implementing automatic address rotation for sending could be an interesting privacy-enhancing feature.\r\n\r\nWould love to hear your thoughts on the technical feasibility and potential benefits of such an implementation.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
