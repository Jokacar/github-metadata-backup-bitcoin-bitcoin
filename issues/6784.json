    "body": "Hi,\njust noticed that my 0.11.0-win64 full node running on laptop becomes unresponsive, drops connections (both p2p and rpc), hogs memory (may take up to 4GB out of total 6).\n![bitcoind](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12157216/10380123/ee88bc9a-6e09-11e5-9df1-dcfd6d3ac8a1.png)\nIt restores normal operation after a while but then again becomes unresponsive. I restarted bitcoind and even spent a few days to reindex DB, with no luck. Does this mean that my laptops 5400 RPM HDD is not fast enough to run full node? Or does it mean that it is a bug? bitcoin.conf is almost empty. Only rpc username, password and non-standard network port number there. Thanks for any clues.\nvay\n",

      "body": "It was fine until few days ago. I notice that hangup happens when bitcoind begin to read chainstate .ldb files on about 500Kb/s speed. That takes a long, processor is not loaded much, no response to p2p connections, rpc connects timing out... Another scenario is when bitcoind starts to write to .ldb files and becomes unresposive until finished. In that case it fully loads one of processor cores and memory use drops at the end of this process.\nI am solo mining using cgminer 4.9.2, so this may be also involved though no changes if I switch to the backup pool temporarily.\nWill set DB cache size relatively small just for the case if the reason is that my laptop processor core is not fast enough to deal with huge buffered data timely.\nThanks for response.\n",

Mem usage is 1.448 GB (started with -dbcachesize=1024). It returns to normal operation only after a while. And then hangs again. I may be wrong and this is just accidental but always when I see it hanged up I see a connection from host naval.nvcube.net which is XT:0.11.0B with an incoming traffic more that from other hosts. Just a blind suspicion, nothing more.\n",

The disk is thrashing. Process memory use is under 300MB, total system memory use is 1.5GB out of 2GB available. CPU load (2 cores) bounces between 10 and 60%, but not pegged at 100%.  Disk use (as reported by Task Manage / Resource Manager) shows about 1MByte/sec read, 3MByte/sec write, with a disk queue length of around 2.5.\n\nAfter 1 to 2 HOURS, bitcoin-qt gets past the \"activating best chain\" message and opens the full UI window. The blockchain on this machine is 8 weeks out of date.\n\nWhile sync'ing to the network, the disk is still thrashing heavily and memory use has not increased above 300MB. The peer list shows it is attempting to connect to peers to ask for blocks, but most of the time the Ping Time shows as N/A and there is no user agent or other handshake info shown. The network use graph shows an occasional blip separated by 5 to 10 minutes of total network silence.\n\nTyping \"help\" in the Debug console window shows no response for nearly 30 seconds.\n\nThe disk thrashing doesn't appear to be caused by low memory page faults, because there's 500MB of free system memory available.\n\nIf I shut down the app (normal exit, not kill), wait for it to shut down, and then start it up again, it sits on the \"activating best chain\" message again for an hour or more.\n\nIs the v0.11.x build running a background thread to update the database and indices on disk?  When this machine was last fired up on main net, it was running Bitcoinqt v0.10.x. \n\nIt's doing a heckovalot of disk I/O with absolutely nothing coming in from the peer network.  Bitcoinqt is trying to connect to peers, but apparently can rarely can make it through the handshake before giving up and starting over.  This isn't a network or firewall/router/ISP saturation issue because this machine can't even manage a connection to another 0.11.0 peer on the local network which has an up-to-date blockchain. I was thinking I could get the machine \"caught up\" in a few minutes by -connect(ing) it to the up to date machine over the 1GB local ethernet, but it's barely able to connect at all.  \n\nNote that this machine normally runs bitcoinqt on testnet, and has shown none of this behavior. However, it's kept up to date, not 8 weeks behind there.\n\nAny idea what's going on?  Why is 0.11.x thrashing the disk so hard, even without incoming txs or blocks?\n",

I see no CPU using increase nor the 300-600 kBytes/s input is much even for laptops HDD.\nI feel like the issue raises when chainstate cache is exhausted. It is 263.5MB with -dbcache=1024 and getmempoolinfo gives 103.8MB and increasing on my server machine at the moment so will check soon.\nMay there be a kind of chainstate cache leak in bitcoind or even memory leak in leveldb?..\n",
