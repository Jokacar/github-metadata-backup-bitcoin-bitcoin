          "body": "## For reviewers\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to make reviewing a bit more sane, I'm breaking this up into a few smaller PRs, but will keep this one open as the parent PR and keep it rebased on the child PRs. The main purpose of having this PR is to track progress on child PRs and also have an easy way to compile `bitcoind` with both send and receive support for testing. Additionally, I'll be adding more functional tests to this PR since it's much easier to test when `bitcoind` can both send and receive.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122\r\n  - Implements the logic from BIP352 without any wallet code. This PR adds the necessary cryptographic functions and implements the logic needed for sending and scanning. This PR also includes the test vectors from the BIP as unit tests. Both the send and receive PRs have this as a dependency. In terms of priority, this PR should be reviewed first\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201\r\n  - Implements sending in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to send to a silent payment address, regardless of whether or not the wallet can receive silent payments\r\n  - Ready for review, but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28202\r\n  - Implements receiving in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to generate silent payment addresses and scan for silent payments, regardless of whether or not the wallet can send to a silent payment address\r\n  - Ready for review but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n\r\nFor the silent payments specification, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458\r\n\r\n## Overall\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the full silent payments scheme: sending and receiving. The following items are not covered in this PR and are intended for follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n* Adding labels for the receiver wallet\r\n* Full RPC coverage (only `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` are covered in this PR)\r\n* Light client support (vending the tweak data per block, either in an index or to serve to indexer, such as electrum server)\r\n* Add benchmarks to validate that there are no DoS concerns for doing silent payment verification for transactions in the mempool\r\n* External signer support (dependent on hardware wallets supporting silent payments)\r\n* More unit / functional test coverage\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24897. Below is a summary of the major changes:\r\n\r\n* Remove labels\r\n  * The original draft included labels, but this has been deferred for a later PR. Labels are not necessary for sending and receiving and there are still some open questions on how best to implement them in Bitcoin Core. Labels can also be added at any point by the receiver without requiring any changes from the sender\r\n* Remove indexes\r\n  * In the original draft, indexes were used when scanning for silent payments and when doing wallet rescans. This has been removed in favor of using `rev*.dat` files for rescanning. It may make sense to add an index in the future, but for the purpose of vending tweak data to light clients, which is still an open question\r\n* Update to implement the most current version of BIP352\r\n  * Since the original draft, there have been a few changes in the BIP which are reflected in the current PR. Most notably, using 33-byte compressed keys for the silent payment address (as opposed to X-only keys in the original draft) \r\n\r\nIt may be helpful for context to read through the discussions on #24897 , but ongoing review should happen in the relevant child PRs listed above.",

          "body": "This PR is part of integrating silent payments into Bitcoin Core. The project is tracked in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28536\r\n\r\nBased on https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1519\r\n\r\n## Pre-work / Refactors\r\n\r\nThe first three commits are pre-work / refactors needed for this PR. They are broken out into the following PRS:\r\n\r\n* #30046 \r\n* #30047 \r\n* #30048\r\n\r\n## BIP352\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses strictly on the BIP logic and attempts to separate it from the wallet and transaction implementation details. This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing. Labels for the receiver are optional and thus deferred for a later PR.\r\n\r\nTest vectors from the BIP are included as unit tests.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing, it is strongly recommended you read https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458 and take a look at the reference python implementation on the BIP.\r\n",

          "title": "Silent Payments (BIP352) module -- discussion about scope and interface",
          "body": "At the last CoreDev meeting the idea of creating a libsecp Silent Payments (BIP352) module for handling the low-level parts [was brought up](https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2023-09/libsecp256k1-meeting/). I've spent some time recently studying the BIP and  it's current implementation (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458, see also tracking issue https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28536) and thought about what parts would make sense to put into this new module. A good amount of code is ready to use, but before opening a concrete PR, I'd like to discuss the related questions \r\n* _What is the exact scope of a potential libsecp256k1 silent payments module?_ and \r\n* _What should a sane interface look like?_\r\n\r\nNote that when I talk about the caller side I'm not only thinking about Bitcoin Core (though this would obviously be the first one taking use of it); one of the benefits of providing a module would be to help other implementations with the hard low-level math parts about Silent Payments, i.e. the interface should definitely have the goal to be easy and intuitive to use.\r\n\r\nI'm listing some basic ingredients from the Silent Payments protocol and  my thoughts about scope/interface to each of them:\r\n\r\n### 1. calculate the outpoints hash (both sender and receiver sides) \r\n(see https://github.com/josibake/bips/blob/silent-payments-bip/bip-0352.mediawiki#user-content-Outpoints_hash)\r\n\r\nThis step includes sorting a given list of serialized 36-bytes outpoints (=32-bytes txid, 4-bytes vout) and then applying a SHA256 hash to the  concatenated result. Should a SP module living in libsecp256k1 land be involved in any of this at all? Three variants are possible:\r\n\r\n1) both sorting and hashing is done by the SP module\r\n2) sorting is done by the caller, hashing is done by the SP module\r\n3) both sorting and hashing has to be done by the caller\r\n\r\nFor the sake of simplicity, I'm leaning towards variant 3) here. Though it would be ideal if users wouldn't need to take care of any  intermediate computations needed for the protocol at all (not even hashing), it seems a bit odd to pass in specific transaction-internal data to an ECC-focused library. Looking at other libsecp modules, we primarily work with \"curve-relevant\" inputs like scalars and group elements (and their serializations), and I feel that handling more than that is out of scope and would be better suited for a different, higher-level library. Invoking a sorting algorithm in libsecp256k1 also just feels kind of odd (though technically easily possible, as [qsort(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/qsort.3.html) is part of the standard library for C89).\r\n\r\nNote that the libsecp256k1 implementation of SHA256 is also not optimized and hence slower than the implementation in Bitcoin Core on common architectures.\r\n\r\n### 2. calculate the sum tweak of input private keys (sender side)\r\n(see https://github.com/josibake/bips/blob/silent-payments-bip/bip-0352.mediawiki#user-content-Creating_outputs)\r\n\r\nThis definitely sounds like something a SP module should take care of. It seems trivial to provide an interface for this part, and one would think that a simple function taking a single list of private keys (i.e. a pointer plus a counter in C world) would do it. The extra challenge here though is that for private keys that are used for taproot outputs, we need to negate them if they'd result in points with an odd y coordinate (to enforce even y parity for the scanning side which only sees an x-only-pubkey, see also https://github.com/josibake/bips/blob/silent-payments-bip/bip-0352.mediawiki#cite_note-why_negate_taproot_private_keys_15). So _some_ of the keys need special treatment. How do we cope with that w.r.t. to an interface that is not too confusing for the user?\r\n\r\n1) Pass two different lists, ones for private keys belonging to pre-taproot outputs and one for keys that result in taproot outputs? (or, create a `silentpayments_privkey` struct that has an extra flag which indicates if even y parity has to be enforced and use that?)\r\n2) Provide a helper function like `secp256k1_silentpayments_privkey_enforce_even_y_parity` that has to be applied on all private keys resulting in BIP341 outputs, before those private keys are passed to the summing function?\r\n\r\nBoth approaches don't sound ideal to me, to be honest, the first one is probably the lesser evil.\r\n\r\n### 3. calculate the sum tweak of input public keys (receiver side)\r\n\r\n(see https://github.com/josibake/bips/blob/silent-payments-bip/bip-0352.mediawiki#user-content-Scanning)\r\n\r\nIn contrast to private keys which are always just 32-bytes long for our purposes, public keys come in different sizes (33, 65 and 32 bytes) and formats (\"full\", x-only). The question arises how a user would pass in those different types in a single function call. Should we\r\n\r\n1) Pass in two lists, one of the type `secp256k1_pubkey`, another one of the type `secp256k1_xonly_pubkey`? (The user would need to call the corresponding parse functions before, obviously)\r\n2) Provide a function that let's the user convert xonly-pubkeys to pubkeys first (in this context, this should be simple by just prepending a 0x02 byte, IIUC) and then only take a single list of `secp256k1_pubkey` elements?\r\n3) Something else?\r\n\r\n### 4. calculate the shared secret using unhashed ECDH (both sides)\r\n\r\nThis seems obvious to put into the library, users shouldn't have the need define a \"not-a-hash\"-hash-functions to pass onto secp256k1_ecdh manually :)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI have to admit after digging deeper it seems that providing an easy interface seems to be a bit more challening than I thought to, especially considering that this can lead to ugly glue code to translate between C++ and C worlds.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? Happy to hear any input, even an opinion like \"please, keep stuff like this stuff completely out of libsecp\" is helpful if it is well-founded. ",

We (frequent contributors) will vote on which projects will be priorities next week in a separate issue.\r\n\r\nThere were concerns in the voting of previous priority projects that some projects nominated did not have champions who were willing to have their project be a priority project. To ensure that all nominated projects have champions who want their project to be a priority project, nominations are limited to self-nominations only.\r\n\r\nProject priorities are those which the frequent contributors to this project have voted on to have more focused review on for the next ~6 months. This issue is to list what projects are ongoing that can be voted on. Voting will occur in a separate issue that will be opened next week.\r\n\r\nNominations will close at the start of the IRC meeting on February 22nd at 14:00 UTC. The issue for voting will be opened at that time as well.\r\n\r\nNominations and voting is limited to those who are part of the bitcoin github organization. Comments in this issue from those outside of the organization will be ignored, and may be deleted. If you are not part of the organization and believe that you should be, please send me an email or message me on IRC.",
