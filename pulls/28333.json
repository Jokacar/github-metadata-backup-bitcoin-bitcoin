    "body": "Instead of constructing ScriptPubKeyMans with no data, and then loading data as we find it, we should gather everything first and then load it all on construction. If there actually is no data and we want to setup generation, then that should also occur in a constructor rather than afterwards.\r\n\r\nThis change is only applied to DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan and ExternalSignerScriptPubKeyMan, and should be done for any ScriptPubKeyMans added in the future. I don't think it's really worth it to do this for LegacyScriptPubKeyMan since it would make loading performance worse (or cause layer violations) and it's (supposed to be) going away soon.",

          "body": "## For reviewers\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to make reviewing a bit more sane, I'm breaking this up into a few smaller PRs, but will keep this one open as the parent PR and keep it rebased on the child PRs. The main purpose of having this PR is to track progress on child PRs and also have an easy way to compile `bitcoind` with both send and receive support for testing. Additionally, I'll be adding more functional tests to this PR since it's much easier to test when `bitcoind` can both send and receive.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122\r\n  - Implements the logic from BIP352 without any wallet code. This PR adds the necessary cryptographic functions and implements the logic needed for sending and scanning. This PR also includes the test vectors from the BIP as unit tests. Both the send and receive PRs have this as a dependency. In terms of priority, this PR should be reviewed first\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201\r\n  - Implements sending in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to send to a silent payment address, regardless of whether or not the wallet can receive silent payments\r\n  - Ready for review, but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28202\r\n  - Implements receiving in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to generate silent payment addresses and scan for silent payments, regardless of whether or not the wallet can send to a silent payment address\r\n  - Ready for review but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n\r\nFor the silent payments specification, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458\r\n\r\n## Overall\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the full silent payments scheme: sending and receiving. The following items are not covered in this PR and are intended for follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n* Adding labels for the receiver wallet\r\n* Full RPC coverage (only `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` are covered in this PR)\r\n* Light client support (vending the tweak data per block, either in an index or to serve to indexer, such as electrum server)\r\n* Add benchmarks to validate that there are no DoS concerns for doing silent payment verification for transactions in the mempool\r\n* External signer support (dependent on hardware wallets supporting silent payments)\r\n* More unit / functional test coverage\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24897. Below is a summary of the major changes:\r\n\r\n* Remove labels\r\n  * The original draft included labels, but this has been deferred for a later PR. Labels are not necessary for sending and receiving and there are still some open questions on how best to implement them in Bitcoin Core. Labels can also be added at any point by the receiver without requiring any changes from the sender\r\n* Remove indexes\r\n  * In the original draft, indexes were used when scanning for silent payments and when doing wallet rescans. This has been removed in favor of using `rev*.dat` files for rescanning. It may make sense to add an index in the future, but for the purpose of vending tweak data to light clients, which is still an open question\r\n* Update to implement the most current version of BIP352\r\n  * Since the original draft, there have been a few changes in the BIP which are reflected in the current PR. Most notably, using 33-byte compressed keys for the silent payment address (as opposed to X-only keys in the original draft) \r\n\r\nIt may be helpful for context to read through the discussions on #24897 , but ongoing review should happen in the relevant child PRs listed above.",

The original issue also recommends sweeping all value from keys in this category, I think that feature can be discussed in the future as a follow-up.\r\n\r\nThis PR also patches `PKDescriptor` from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22051 where matching public keys were not returned.\r\n\r\nFollow-up PR for the GUI: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/723",

          "body": "The wallet currently does not know the master key that was used to generate the automatically generated descriptors. This makes it difficult to add new automatically generated descriptors when new ones are introduced. So instead of losing this information after the descriptors are created, have `CWallet` store it. The xpub will be stored in a new `activehdkey` field. The private key must be one of the keys that is used by the descriptors, and will be extracted upon loading.\r\n\r\nAs this is a new field, wallets will be automatically upgraded upon loading. This loading is backwards compatible and uses a new non-required flag `WALLET_FLAG_GLOBAL_HD_KEY` to signal that the upgrade completed. The upgrade will search for an xpub that is shared by `pkh()`, `wpkh()`, and `sh(wpkh()` descriptors with the derivation pattern that we use. For new wallets, the xpub will be set during descriptor creation rather than trying to reverse engineer it. The flag will be set for all wallets, regardless of whether such an xpub was found or can even exist, in order to indicate that the upgrade will not need to be run in the future.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to have a `gethdkey` command which is useful for those who need a simple way to get an xpub from a wallet. `gethdkey` can also take a boolean parameter to indicate whether it should also output the corresponding xprv.\r\n\r\nSupercedes #23417",

This is done in various places, such as `IsMine`, and helper functions for fetching a `ScriptPubKeyMan` and a `SolvingProvider`. This also has a bit of a performance impact on standard descriptor wallets, although less noticeable due to the small number of SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAs these functions are based on doing `IsMine` for each `ScriptPubKeyMan`, we can improve this performance by caching `IsMine` scriptPubKeys for all descriptors and use that to determine which `ScriptPubKeyMan` to actually use for those things. This cache is used exclusively and we no longer iterate the SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAlso added a benchmark for `IsMine`.",

          "body": "It is useful to have a RPC that can create and add the automatically generated descriptors (that are normally made during creation) to a wallet. This is especially useful when a new default descriptor has been implemented as it allows wallets created before that time to quickly and easily add that type of descriptor.\r\n\r\nIn particular, descriptor wallets created before Taproot was implemented can use the new `createwalletdescriptor` RPC in order to get a Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to keep the newly generated descriptor in line with the existing descriptors, this PR uses #26728 as it exposes a \"wallet extended key\" for us (in addition to upgrading wallets implemented prior to have a wallet xpub). The newly generated descriptors will use the \"wallet extended key\" stored in `CWallet` that PR adds.\r\n\r\n`createwalletdescriptor` is generic and so it can also be used with the other address types. Of course, it given the same wallet extended key, address type, and internal-ness, it will create the same descriptor. So some refactoring has been done in order to detect that the same descriptor is about to be created, and to avoid overwriting any existing descriptors.",

          "body": "Depends on #26728.\r\n\r\nThis PR expands the wallet RPC `gethdkey` introduced in #26728. It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",

          "body": "This PR implements receiving silent payment transactions through the use of a new `ScriptPubKeyMan` type: `SilentPaymentsSPKM`. This is a descriptor wallet only feature, although it does not use descriptors.\r\n\r\nThis is an optional feature, so the only way to use it is to create a new wallet with `createwallet` with `silent_payments=true`. Such wallets will have a single `SilentPaymentsSPKM` that is used for both receiving and change. Since silent payments only have a single address, repeated calls to `getnewaddress` and `getrawchangeaddress` always return the same address, however the receiving and change addresses are different, see the BIP for how the change is generated.\r\n\r\nSince silent payments requires the spent coins in order to extract public keys from them, `TransactionAddedToMempool` is modified to also provide that information. For scanning blocks, the wallet will retrieve that information from the undo data. Additionally, when rescanning, a silent payments wallet must use the slow rescan method.\r\n\r\nThe labels feature has not been fully implemented yet and is left for a followup.\r\n\r\nBased on #28122 and #28201 \r\n\r\nAlternative to #28202",

          "body": "Last step in a chain of PRs (#26836, #28894, #28987, #29403).\r\n\r\nThe initial benchmark conducted locally showed a ~65% processing time reduction, on a SSD.\r\nResults, from the very first benchmark, can be found at the end of the description.\r\n\r\n#### Detailed Description:\r\nThe current wallet migration process performs only individual db writes. Accessing disk to\r\ndelete all legacy records, clone and clean each address book entry for every created wallet,\r\ncreate each new descriptor (with their corresponding master key, caches and key pool), and\r\nalso clone and delete each transaction that requires to be transferred to a different wallet.\r\n\r\nThis work consolidates all individual disk writes into two batch operations. One for the descriptors\r\ncreation from the legacy data and a second one for the execution of the migration process itself.\r\nEfficiently dumping all the information to disk at once atomically at the end of each process.\r\n\r\nThis represent a speed up and also a consistency improvement. During migration, we either\r\nwant to succeed or fail. No other outcomes should be accepted. We should never leave a\r\npartially migrated wallet on disk and request the user to manually restore the previous wallet from\r\na backup (at least not if we can avoid it).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since db transactions relevant to the key pool generation were also batched, this work\r\nalso speeds up the regular wallet creation process.\r\n\r\n#### Note for Testers:\r\nThe first commit introduces a benchmark for the migration process. This one can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master to compare results pre and post changes.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the benchmark setup may take some time (~70 seconds here) due to the absence\r\nof a batching mechanism for the address generation process (`GetNewDestination()` calls). Which,\r\nI plan to address in a separate PR, just to not continue expanding this PR.\r\n\r\n————————————————————————\r\n\r\nBenchmark on master (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:-----------\r\n|   65,093,884,958.00 |                0.02 |    0.0% |     65.09 | `WalletMigration`\r\n\r\nBenchmark on this branch (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|   22,926,814,750.00 |                0.04 |    0.0% |     22.93 | `WalletMigration`",

To be able to use `createwalletdescriptor` with the other address types, we need a way to change the wallet extended key, and so `sethdseed` has been updated and enabled for descriptor wallets. As with legacy wallets, when called without parameters, it will generate a new random master key for the wallet. It can also take a xprv and set that as the master key. It still takes a BIP 32 seed as WIF or as hex as we do for legacy wallets. The seed will be transformed into and stored as a BIP 32 extended key. The latter is to give us greater compatibility with other wallets which often produce non-WIF HD seeds.\r\n\r\nSplit from #25907",

          "body": "This PR adds a `createwalletdescriptor` RPC which allows users to add new automatically generated descriptors to their wallet, e.g. to upgrade a 0.21.x wallet to contain a taproot descriptor. This RPC takes 3 arguments: the output type to create a descriptor for, whether the descriptor will be internal or external, and the HD key to use if the user wishes to use a specific key. The HD key is an optional parameter. If it is not specified, the wallet will use the key shared by the active descriptors, if they are all single key. For most users in the expected upgrade scenario, this should be sufficient. In more advanced cases, the user must specify the HD key to use.\r\n\r\nCurrently, specified HD keys must already exist in the wallet. To make it easier for the user to know, `gethdkeys` is also added to list out the HD keys in use by all of the descriptors in the wallet. This will include all HD keys, whether we have the private key, for it, which descriptors use it and their activeness, and optionally the extended private key. In this way, users with more complex wallets will be still be able to get HD keys from their wallet for use in other scenarios, and if they want to use `createwalletdescriptor`, they can easily get the keys that they can specify to it.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1866961865",

Ryanofsky [suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1867721948) A `void(KEY)` descriptor which allows for a key to be specified, but produces no scripts. These can be imported into the wallet, and subsequently retrieved with `gethdkeys`. Additionally, `listdescriptors` will output these descriptors so that they can be easily backed up.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it easier for people to add HD keys to their wallet, and to generate a new one if they want to rotate their descriptors, an `addhdkey` RPC is also added. Without arguments, it will generate a new HD key and add it to the wallet via a `void(KEY)` descriptor. If provided a private key, it will construct the descriptor and add it to the wallet.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1866961865\r\n\r\nBased on #29130 as `gethdkeys` is useful for testing this.",

          "title": "Improve new LogDebug/Trace/Info/Warning/Error Macros",
          "body": "Improve new LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(),  LogWarning(), LogError() macros introduced in #28318:\r\n\r\n- Make them consistent, now all accepting the same parameters.\r\n- Make them all accept log categories, to make it possible to filter or highlight log messages from a particular component.\r\n- Make them compatible with wallet logging, which includes the wallet name in log messages.\r\n- Make them not rely on a global LogInstance, to provide better control of logging in controlled environments, such as unit tests that want to selectively capture log output, or libbitcoinkernel applications that want to have multiple instances of validation objects without mixing their log output.\r\n- Make them less verbose by not requiring category constants to be specified in individual log prints.\r\n\r\nAn [overview](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0cd1616d47e61e125eb3e573573c0c56fba6b775/src/logging.h#L293-L332) of the macros can be found in the logging header.\r\n\r\n### Problems this PR attempts to solve\r\n\r\nThe new log macros in introduced #28318 are generally great. They allow writing code that is succinct and clear, and make it a lot easier to figure out what log levels are being used. Unfortunately, the new macros are slightly less general than than needed to be used throughout the codebase. Particularly:\r\n\r\n1. The new macros cannot be used conveniently in wallet code because wallet log prints are supposed to automatically attach wallet names to log messages.\r\n2. The new macros cannot be used in libbitcoinkernel code because they do not allow specifying a logger instance.\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, the only alternative approach to solving these problems would be to reimplement these macros outside the logging framework so they could be used by wallet and validation code. This PR just takes the approach of slightly generalizing these macros so they work everywhere.\r\n\r\n### Note to reviewers\r\n\r\nI'd encourage looking at the description and code changes in this PR to evaluate it and try to come an independent judgement before looking at the discussion history. Unfortunately and regrettably, I made some dismissive comments on the previous PR, so the discussion here starts out immediately heated.\r\n\r\nA summary of the disagreement is that ajtowns believes allowing log syntax `LogDebug(m_log, \"debug message\\n\")` is [harmful](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29256#issuecomment-2085586513) if log category is part of the `m_log` argument instead of being an explicit category constant. I think omitting the explicit category constant is not a big deal, cuts down on verbosity and repetition, and allows important features like logging to different instances, and automatically adding other metadata (like wallet filenames) to log messages. Other parts of the discussion refer to earlier versions of the PR, go down various tangents, and make the argument that this PR is unnecessary, not that it is harmful.",

          "title": "[WIP] wallet: standardize change output detection process",
          "body": "Depends on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27601, please go there first.\r\n\r\nThis work aims to define, and implement a base standard mechanism to\r\ndetect individual change outputs.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nCurrently, the wallet detects whether an output is change or not based\r\non data stored in the address book.\r\n\r\nThere is no notion of “change outputs”, the wallet detects change scripts.\r\n\r\nConnoting that any address book record modification has implications\r\non all the historical outputs related to that particular destination. Meaning\r\nthat all those outputs can either be change or not. There is no middle-ground\r\ngranular distinction.\r\n\r\n#### How Change Detection Currently Works?\r\n\r\nThe wallet walks-through the transaction outputs, extracts the script\r\ndestination and verify the following two points:\r\n\r\n1) If the destination doesn't exist in the address book, then the script\r\n    is a \"change address\".\r\n   \r\n2) If the destination exists in the address book, but it doesn't have a\r\n     label, then the script is a \"change address\".\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are a good number of problems in the current approach:\r\n\r\n- We make the wallet dependent on an external structure, with separate storage.\r\n   Which has to be updated and maintained along with the wallet state.\r\n\r\n- It cannot be maintained nor recovered across different wallet instances.\r\n   Cannot re-create the, possibly custom, address book data only by importing\r\n   the wallet descriptor string.\r\n\r\n- As the address book is an structure that the user can freely modify, the change\r\n   detection process might differ through different wallets.\r\n \r\n- The current rudimentary assumptions of \"no address book entry\" or \"no label set for the address book entry\"\r\n  to denote that certain script destination is change or not can easily be broken:\r\n  E.g. derive an address from one of the wallet’s external paths manually. Then send coins to it.\r\n  As the receive destination wasn't created inside the wallet, the wallet has no associated address book entry.\r\n  So, the reception is invalidly detected as change (added a test case for it).\r\n\r\n- The wallet can't detect change outputs on more complex scripts such as multi-sig change outputs.\r\n\r\n- The wallet is not able to detect change outputs going to an internal address if the internal address has a label.\r\n  (E.g. the user can manually set a label for the internal address and, doing that, make that all the change\r\n  outputs, in the wallet history, that were sent to the destination are no longer detected as change).\r\n\r\n- There isn’t a way to distinguish the external reception of coins into an internal address. Coins reception on any\r\n   internal address are always detected as change.\r\n\r\n### New Change Detection Mechanism Goals\r\n\r\nAiming to:\r\n\r\n* Define a base mechanism to align different wallet implementations. Preventing each piece of software\r\n  from diverging on the basic change outputs distinction.\r\n\r\n* Detect change outputs on-demand without requiring to maintain an external data structure synced with the\r\n   latest wallet state.\r\n\r\n* Independently, and accurately, detect change outputs regardless data stored in structures that the user\r\n   can freely modify.\r\n\r\n* Granular distinction between change vs non-change outputs that were sent to the same internal address.\r\n  E.g. the reception of coins, from an external source, on internal addresses will not longer be detected\r\n  as change anymore.\r\n\r\n* Expand the change detection to more complex scripts such as a multi-sig protected addresses. (While they\r\n  are added into the wallet on an internal spkm)\r\n\r\n#### Change Output Detection Rules\r\n\r\nA transaction output is change if it fulfills the following points:\r\n\r\n1) At least one of the parent transaction inputs is from the wallet. (If none of them are, then the wallet is receiving coins\r\n    on an internal address).\r\n\r\n2) The script extracted destination is from the wallet and is located in one of the internal script pub key manager.\r\n    (e.g. derived from an internal derivation path)\r\n\r\n#### What about legacy wallets?\r\n\r\nIf the legacy wallet is HD post-split, we have an internal derivation path, so we can follow the same process as\r\ndescriptors wallet. Unless the destination is on the pre-split key pool, in which case, we fallback to the follow-up\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nIf the legacy wallet is pre-split, we continue using the address book as we either have an HD wallet with keys\r\nderived only on the external path, or we are using raw keypool.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————\r\n\r\n#### Extra Note\r\nThis PR, in about 85% at least, is about expanding the current test coverage for the change output detection area.\r\n\r\n#### TO DO (still WIP):\r\n\r\n* [x] Save “internal” flag on non-active descriptors so the wallet can use them on the change detection process.\r\n   (which will fix the currently failing test cases).\r\n* [ ] Re-organize commits so tests always pass.\r\n* [ ] Verify backwards compatibility.",

          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",
