          "title": "Cluster mempool, CPFP carveout, and V3 transaction policy",
          "body": "Opening an issue for high-level discussion, as the PR that implements this has gotten difficult to follow.\r\n\r\n### Cluster mempool\r\n\r\nWork is underway to [redesign the mempool](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393/1) with different topology constraints on the transaction graph than exist today.  I originally described this proposal in a github issue (#27677), and have shared a draft implementation (#28676).  In brief, with a new mempool design we could simultaneously: fix bugs with mempool eviction and the incentive compatibility of RBF replacements; achieve improved performance; eliminate the ancestor/descendant limits (with the introduction of a likely more relaxed \"cluster\" limit); and likely be in a position to better implement complex behaviors like package validation and package rbf.\r\n\r\n### CPFP carveout is not compatible with cluster mempool\r\n\r\nAs I explain [here](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393#the-cpfp-carveout-rule-can-no-longer-be-supported-12), I believe the CPFP carveout rule (introduced in #15681) is not compatible with the new design. Since some users may be relying on this behavior, we should come up with a workaround to avoid breaking existing applications.\r\n\r\n### V3 transaction policy\r\n\r\nDescribed in #28948, the v3 transaction policy is a proposal to introduce topology restrictions on unconfirmed transactions with `nVersion=3` (which are currently non-standard for relay, and would be made standard under the proposal).  Specifically, v3 transactions would be:\r\n- opted-in to RBF replacement policies (whatever those may be, as they evolve in our project)\r\n- permitted to only be part of mempool clusters that are at most of size 2 (meaning 1 parent/1 child)\r\n- required to have any unconfirmed parents or children also be marked v3 (and therefore subject to these rules)\r\n- bounded in size to at most 1000 vbytes, if the child of an unconfirmed (and therefore v3) parent\r\n\r\nBy offering a policy rule that can enforce a much tighter topology restriction that the current ancestor/descendant limits, we hope to achieve a few things:\r\n\r\n#### Replacing CPFP carveout (with a new sibling-replacement policy)\r\n\r\nWe can provide a way to achieve the goals of the CPFP carveout rule even if the existing carevout rule were to be dropped. As explained in [this post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-November/016518.html), the use-case contemplated by the CPFP carveout rule was one where a single transaction might have two spendable outputs, each spendable by a different party, and that either party should be able to spend their output without hitting global topology limits, provided that their spending transaction was bounded in size and had no other unconfirmed parents. If the v3 policy rule were to be applied to the LN commitment transactions described in that post, then neither of the two outputs that are spendable could be used to hit the limits that carveout is designed to bypass. \r\n\r\nSo if we couple the v3 policy with an RBF rule that would allow one spend of a v3 transaction to replace an existing lower-feerate spend of that same parent -- something we call *sibling eviction* and has a draft implementation in #29306 -- then I believe we will have enacted a set of policies that replicate the CPFP carveout use case. \r\n\r\n#### Provide a general way for fee bumping to work better\r\n\r\nEven apart from the needs of layer 2 protocols, the new v3 policy serves as a general way to bypass the issue of RBF being expensive when a child transaction is created that has a large fee (and is typically large in size, allowing for it to be low feerate).  This has been the source of user complaints since our RBF policies were first deployed, and by bounding the size of child transactions we effectively can limit the amount of additional fee a user would need to pay due to the presence of such children.  \r\n\r\nNote, of course, that this property is also what makes the sibling-eviction-policy described above workable.\r\n\r\n### Proposed roadmap\r\n\r\nTo unblock the cluster mempool project, I think we need the following:\r\n1. Deployment of the V3 policy rules (current proposal is #28948)\r\n2. Deployment of V3 sibling eviction rbf rules (current proposal is #29306)\r\n\r\nThen, projects that use CPFP carveout would need to be able to adopt the new policy rules.  After the last LN spec discussion, I understand that migrating their commitment transactions to use a new format (even just a change in version number) might take time to coordinate, and that in the meantime we should simply use some other unique markers to identify those commitment transactions, and implicitly imbue such transactions with the v3 policy rules.  However, doing so would eliminate the ability to batch-CPFP several unconfirmed commitment transactions at once (although this isn't reliable anyway today, since the carveout protections don't apply to this case, but perhaps this sometimes works fine and is more efficient).\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me if that final step -- of imbuing transactions with v3 policy, rather than requiring explicit opt-in -- is needed before we move further forward with cluster mempool, or even if doing so would be acceptable to the broader community, but I think we could entertain that idea as a way to assist the LN project with migration and to decouple progress in this project from upgrade timelines in that one.\r\n\r\n### Feedback\r\n\r\nWhile we're still working out implementation details in the v3 and v3-sibling-eviction PRs, it would be great to get concept ACKs on this roadmap from any users of the current CPFP carveout policy.  In particular, please provide feedback on:\r\n1. whether there are use cases of CPFP carveout that are not covered by the V3 proposal as I described above, and \r\n2. whether the \"imbued v3\" behavior described above should be treated as a blocker for CPFP carveout removal as well, or if it's a bad idea due to (eg) breaking the ability to batch-CPFP (or any other reason)",

          "body": "Given that the use of a transaction's nVersion is always as an unsigned int, it doesn't make sense to store it as signed and then cast it to unsigned everywhere it is used and displayed.\r\n\r\nSince a few alternative implementations have recently been revealed to have made an error with this signedness that would have resulted in consensus failure, I think it makes sense for us to just make this always unsigned to make it clear that the version is treated as unsigned. This would also help us avoid future potential issues with signedness of this value.\r\n\r\nI believe that this is safe and does not actually change what transactions would or would not be considered both standard and consensus valid. Within consensus, the only use of the version in consensus is in BIP68 validation which was already casting it to uint32_t. Within policy, although it is used as a signed int for the transaction version number check, I do not think that this change would change standardness. Standard transactions are limited to the range [1, 2]. Negative numbers would have fallen under the < 1 condition, but by making it unsigned, they are still non-standard under the > 2 condition.\r\n\r\nUnsigned and signed ints are serialized and unserialized the same way so there is no change in serialization.",

      "body": "> What is your thinking on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29454 ?\r\n\r\nSame as said that for sibling evictions - I’ll go to hack a tx-relay jamming / pinning toolkit, that way we’ll have more information on the robustness of those current proposed anti-pinning mitigations. I still maintain there are very incomplete for time-sensitive transaction flows, especially in face of “loophole” and NTA pinnings. I’m incredibly worried for the security of the Lightning Network if we don’t deploy additional anti-pinning mitigations on top of those ones over the future years - We have not seen yet script kiddies attacking the network. \r\n\r\nUnder today inertia, we’ll probably converge towards a centralized network of ~50 LSPs relying on traditional social trust rather than relying on trust-minimized confirmation of pre-signed transactions. This is very problematic if they wish to accept channel traffic from low-resources spokes LN nodes, especially in geographical areas where social trust mechanism cannot be afforded by end-users.\r\n\r\nOn #29454, I still prefer to keep experimenting on “transaction-issuer selected policy limits” which might encompass more stringent tx-relay jamming on a minor fork of Bitcoin Core. Coming up with a sound technical proposal in matters of tx-relay policy likely demands few rounds of iterations and realistically we already have a severe shortage of qualified review bandwidth in those areas.\r\n\r\nThe initial reason closing of #29448 was my own realization that the introduction of differentiated tx-relay policy among the tx-relay network of nodes will probably generate with time tiers of transaction economic traffic priority (I really cannot see how it worsens memory / CPU DoS robustness per se ?). I don’t think this is a phenomena we can do a lot as a full-node implementation, as we’re seeing with the appearance of transaction accelerators by mining pools. There is transaction issuer demand for such services apparently. Yet we should be careful of doing works in parallel to maintain bip152 block propagation and as such long-term decentralization of the base-layer network.\r\n\r\nI’m not opposing the deployment of `TX_MAX_STANDARD_VERSION=3` in Bitcoin Core v28.0.",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [x] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick). [DONE, see [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/research-into-the-effects-of-a-cluster-size-limited-mempool-in-2023/794/1)]\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add duplicate transactions to the mempool (#29990).\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts. Is this a problem?",

For example, the current memory bounds for orphanage is 100KvB * 100 = 40MB, and guaranteeing 1 tx per peer would require reserving a pretty large space.\r\n\r\nHistory for `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT=100KvB` (copied from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29873#issuecomment-2115459510):\r\n- 2010-09-13 In https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3df62878c3cece15a8921fbbdee7859ee9368768 satoshi added a 100kB (MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_GEN/5 with MBS_GEN = MAX_BLOCK_SIZE/2) limit on new transactions in CreateTransaction()\r\n- 2013-02-04 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2273 In gavin gave that constant a name, and made it apply to transaction relay as well\r\n\r\nLowering `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT` for all txns is not being proposed, as there are existing apps/protocols that rely on large transactions. However, it's been brought up that we should consider this for TRUCs (which is especially designed to avoid Rule 3 pinning).\r\n\r\nThis reduction should be ok because using nVersion=3 isn't standard yet, so this wouldn't break somebody's existing use case. If we find that this is too small, we can always increase it later. Decreasing would be much more difficult.\r\n~[Expected size of a commitment transaction](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md#expected-weight-of-the-commitment-transaction) is within (900 + 172 * 483 + 224) / 4 = 21050vB~ EDIT: this is incorrect, but perhaps not something that should affect how we choose this number.",

I believe the `nVersion` can be changed via `CCoinControl::m_version`, though I'm not sure if that is accessible so I didn't write a test for it.\r\n\r\nRebased on top of #29873 + master (conflict with #29086)",
