    "title": "IBD performance regression in 27.0rc1 on Windows",
    "body": "While investigating the variance in IBD when synchronizing from network nodes and comparing it to synchronizing from a local node, I noticed a significant slowdown when I switched the synchronizing node to 27.0rc1. When connected to a local node (also 27.0rc1), it reaches block 120,000 about 10% slower on average than 26.0, with a much higher variance. I measured around 100 runs of each, alternating between the versions every time. Headers (pre-)sync is not included in the measurement. OS is Windows 10, I'm using pre-built binaries for both versions.\r\n\r\n26.0:\r\n![ibd26corrected](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/43024885/e3b3c7de-ebe8-4620-8ad2-b60ce3375551)\r\n\r\n27.0rc1:\r\n![ibd27rc1corrected](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/43024885/02aa6e7b-5fd0-46f3-bf1e-0be30f1bdcf7)\r\n\r\nEDIT: The issue seems to be only with the pre-built release binary for Windows. Tests with a pre-built Linux binary on WSL and a self-built MSVC binary don't show the regression (see later posts).",

      "body": "@maflcko\r\n\r\n> I forgot to mention that optimization was enabled in commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/41e378a0a1f0729b423034f47c28a4e83287a1e8. So for a fair comparison, one would have to backport https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/41e378a0a1f0729b423034f47c28a4e83287a1e8 to 26.0.\r\n\r\nThe original regression is also in variance which doesn't appear with the MSVC binary, so I don't think it's necessary to test the backport.\r\n\r\n@fanquake\r\n\r\n> It's not clear to me if there is still an issue here or not. Or is there still a regression when comparing our 26.x and 27.x Windows release binaries?\r\n\r\nThe regression is in the pre-built 27.0rc1 binary for Windows (which isn't MSVC), see original post. Pre-built binary for Linux tested on WSL and self-built MSVC binary for Windows don't have the regression, see later posts.",
