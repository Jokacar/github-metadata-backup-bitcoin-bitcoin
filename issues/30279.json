BIP-341 merely says \"should\".\r\n\r\nRemoving the descriptors.md in in favor of BIPs is not optimal, because:\r\n\r\n- the BIPs are not the docs for Bitcoin Core - Bitcoin Core should document itself what it supports\r\n- it is hard to get an overview of what is supported in Bitcoin Core by scrolling BIPs\r\n\r\nI think the best would be to complete the docs and link to the relevant BIPs. In this particular issue, linking to BIP-386 for `tr(...)` descriptors and mentioning that `tr(KEY)` uses the tweak described in BIP-341 would make the docs here much more useful.\r\n\r\nOther parts are also not up to date, like the support for miniscript expressions for `SCRIPT`. There it would also be great to expand the docs and link to https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/ (afaik there is no BIP for that).",
