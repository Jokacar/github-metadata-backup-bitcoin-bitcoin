    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\r\n\r\nThousands of \"/Satoshi-BTC(Bitcoin Finance):0.15.1/\" peers are suddenly connecting to my two nodes and sending GIGABYTES of information even though my nodes are fully synced, this doesn't feel like expected behavior.\r\n\r\nCan we have a way to ban something like this? They are connecting from only cloud providers or inside mainland China. I can barely keep up banning these. Is it possible to have a way to reject this sort of thing from happening automatically?\r\n\r\nEdit: They connect like twenty at a time and by the time I ban them, the whole screen has filled up with more and I have been fighting them off for HOURS now. This does not feel like legitimate network activity at all.\r\n\r\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
