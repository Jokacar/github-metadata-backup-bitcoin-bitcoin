    "body": "The check at [txn_doublespend.py, line 113](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/qa/rpc-tests/txn_doublespend.py#L113) passes, but should not.\n\nTransaction `doublespend` is created using `gather_inputs` and does not debit account `foo`.  However, in the course of the test, account metadata is synced to `doublespend` from introduced-then-conflicted `tx1`, causing the test to pass.\n\nThe old test [txnmall.sh](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b5d1b1092998bc95313856d535c632ea5a8f9104/qa/rpc-tests/txnmall.sh) checked that `SyncMetaData` protected accounts from the effects of clones that had been received and possibly confirmed, by syncing metadata from the first-seen spend of an input, to all spends of that input.\n\nThe new test does not introduce a clone, but rather a true (non-clone) double-spend.  `SyncMetaData` does not define a clean mapping of accounts for conflicting transactions in general, and no such mapping is really possible.   A conflict may respend several inputs, each of which had a different account in its first-spend.\n\nI can commit an `IsEquivalentTo` check to `SyncMetaData`, so that only true clones have their metadata synced.  This will cause the test to fail.  The question is, how should the test be updated?  What do we actually want to test regarding double-spends and accounts?\n\nPing @gavinandresen\n",

Rather than fix it, the consensus seems to lean towards scrapping the accounting system entirely, and returning to a system where keys may have labels (or tags, as I prefer to call them).\n\nThe accounting system can easily result in negative or odd balances if misused or misunderstood, which has happened in the field.  Use of raw tx API or direct spends exacerbates this.  Users are used to seemingly-odd practices of transferring imaginary money from a dummy account, to eliminate a negative number in some cases.\n\nPractically speaking, this seems likely to be a large, incompatible change to RPC.  This implies\n- other incompatible RPC changes are possible\n- the following line in rpcserver.cpp should be updated along standard REST API versioning conventions, changing the standard URI path from \"/\" to \"/v2/\" or somesuch.\n\n```\n        if (strURI != \"/\") {\n```\n",

Testing double-spend detection is good, but currently the test's success depends on syncing accounting data to true double-spends (not good).\n\nWe could reinstate the specific malleability test txnmall.sh for as long as accounting behavior matters and mutants are possible.\n\n@gavinandresen wrote this new test, so I'm hoping he can weigh in on this.\n",
