    "body": "resolves #29618.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a config flag option `-v2onlyclearnet` which disallows v1 connections on ipv4 and ipv6 networks since they're unencrypted. v1 connections are still possible from tor/i2p/cjdns peers since they're encrypted networks.\r\n\r\n- v1 outbound connections to peers are not attempted\r\n- v1 reconnections are not attempted (if peer is falsely advertised as v2 peer and we attempt a v2 connection but it fails, we do not attempt a v1 reconnection when `-v2onlyclearnet` is switched on)\r\n- v1 inbound connections are immediately disconnected\r\n\r\nCurrently 59.71% of network supports v2 (according to https://bitnodes.io/nodes) so don't see risk of network partition with the option set as default off. Also found 41-45 % of addresses supporting v2 in the addrman of nodes I checked - personal node and the nodes in [peer.observer](https://peer.observer/addrman/alice). (You can use [this branch ](https://github.com/stratospher/bitcoin/commits/addrinfo_service_display/)to check the % of v2 addresses in a node's addrman.)",

      "body": "> You could also run tor-only in this case, but that has its own disadvantages and `-onlynet=onion` shares the exact same downside that if everyone did it, the network would split. \r\n\r\nOur docs address this to an extent [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/i2p.md#additional-configuration-options-related-to-i2p) and [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/cjdns.md#additional-configuration-options-related-to-cjdns). As those docs point out, `-onlynet` only affects outbound connections (not inbound and manual ones), and we suggest that it be used with multiple networks.  My blog goes further into it [here](https://jonatack.github.io/articles/using-alternative-p2p-networks-with-bitcoin-core#why-use-multiple-bitcoin-p2p-networks) and [here](https://jonatack.github.io/articles/using-alternative-p2p-networks-with-bitcoin-core#considerations-with-running-tor-only).\r\n\r\n> If some, but not all nodes who are running only on privacy networks would be willing to also have clearnet peers with this option, that would be a good thing in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAgree. My node, for instance, runs over tor/i2p/cjdns and makes manual connections to trusted clearnet peers.\r\n\r\n> if V2-only is widespread, it may be hard to eclipse V2-only node, but then it becomes easy to eclipse a V1 node which has a problem of finding peers to connect to, so an attacker starts a lot of nodes that do accept V1 connections.\r\n\r\nAgree. With this change, clearnet node operators may need to accept v2, whether they wish to or not. We generally try to avoid forcing users to do things. I suppose my concept ack on this would depend on that tradeoff.",
