    "body": "In this PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29535 it was noticed that the functional test runner was skipping running the tests with the message of `Test '' not found in full test list`\r\n\r\nI believe that this was caused by Powershell passing a blank `TEST_RUNNER_EXTRA` environment variable as an empty flag to the `test_runner.py` script which then tries to find a test to run with a blank name.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches the functional tests back to using Powershell but instead of passing an empty argument, constructs a command string and then executes that command. It also prints the powershell version to help diagnose any issues in the future (not that this issue was related to powershell version).\r\n\r\nI believe it's best to switch back to powershell rather than stick with cmd, even though it currently works, as this is what I would expect the majority of users and windows developers would use.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome extra notes:\r\n\r\n- Run with `--extended takes` ~ 28 minutes\r\n- Run without `--extended takes` ~ 15 minutes\r\n- The mac job appears to never run with `--extended`",

I still don't understand what/how this broke in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe breaking change was introduced in [PowerShell 7.3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-7-3-general-availability/#improvement-to-native-command-argument-passing):\r\n> Windows and Linux/macOS have fundamental differences in how native command arguments are handled specifically when quotes are involved. We added a new feature [`$PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing`](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/learn/experimental-features#psnativecommandargumentpassing) to control how PowerShell passes arguments to native commands. The default behavior for Windows and Linux/macOS should work as most users expect in their respective environments.\r\n\r\n**tl;dr:** Empty strings are preserved as arguments now.\r\n\r\nThe CI was broken due to the PowerShell [upgrade](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/9115) from 7.2.18 to 7.4.1.",
