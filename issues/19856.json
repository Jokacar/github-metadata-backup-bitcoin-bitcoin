    "title": "Some transactions are not shown in listtransactions output",
    "body": "\r\nI have two bitcoin core full nodes. I have one wallet.dat file on both nodes. One node is a master and second node is a reserve. Master signs and sends transactions. Reserve node only receives updates from network. I create new addresses on the master node only and the reserve node derives the same addresses.\r\n\r\nI don’t use any other commands on the reserve node. The reserve node creates addresses automatically after receiving a transaction to a new address. This process is possible due to using BIP32 key derivation from one master key.\r\n\r\nSo, I have constantly synchronized master and reserve nodes. If there are problems with the master, then I switch to the reserve.\r\n\r\nI see some strange behavior appear during this process. Some transactions are not shown in the `listtransactions` output. I did a research an found that only \"in-wallet\" transactions are not shown in the `listransactions`. The \"in-wallet\" transactions are transactions that were sent with sender’s and receiver’s keys, which are stored in my wallet. I also found that new addresses on the reserve node are created whithout a label.\r\n\r\nAfter adding a label to the address the problem is gone. But adding a label requires additional steps I want to avoid.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nResults of `listtransactions` also shown \"in-wallet\" transactions to addresses without labels\r\n\r\n\r\n**Current Behavior**\r\n\r\nResults of `listtransactions` doesn’t shown \"in-wallet\" transactions to addresses without labels\r\n\r\n**Possible Solution**\r\n\r\n- Automatic adding of a default label to the addresses, derived to the reserve node.\r\n\r\n- Print transactions sent to addresses without labels in `listtransactions`.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1.  Run and sync full nodes A and B.\r\n\r\n2.  Stop nodes A and B.\r\n\r\n3.  Copy wallet.dat from node A to node B.\r\n\r\n4.  Run nodes A and B\r\n\r\n5.  Use `getnewaddress` method on node A 10 times. Let’s assume the 10-th address is `$ADDRESS`.\r\n\r\n6.  Use `sendtoaddress` method on node A. Send 0.001 coins from another address to the `$ADDRESS`. `bitcoin-cli sendtoaddress $ADDRESS 0.001`. Let’s assume the result txid is `$TXID`.\r\n\r\n7.  Use `listtransaction \"*\"` method on node B. You don’t see the `$TXID` transaction in list.\r\n\r\n8.  Use `gettransactions`, or `listunspent` methods on node B. You can see the transaction details. Wallet balance changed on node B and is equal to node A.\r\n\r\n9.  Use `getaddressinfo $ADDRESS` method on node A. You can see that address had the default label (`\"\"`).\r\n\r\n10. Use `getaddressinfo $ADDRESS` method on node B. You can see that the address doesn’t have any label.\r\n\r\n**Context (Environment)**\r\n\r\nThe problem is occured on any version of bitcoin core testnet and mainnet. The problem is also occured on litecoin and any bitcoin-based coins.\r\n\r\n",

So your send-to-self transactions do not appear in `listtransactions` because they are being detected as change.\r\n\r\nGenerally it is not advised to have the same wallet loaded in multiple places as you get unexpected behavior like what you are seeing. A lot of the wallet's change detection functionality is based on user actions within the wallet (like requesting addresses), and so it can kind of break when you have a wallet where the user isn't interacting with it directly (i.e. node B).",

Currently this requires two different descriptors where most of the descriptor is the same but only the derivation path at the end is different. So instead, one descriptor could contain multiple derivation paths following the xpub.\r\n\r\nI propose that we could use `{}` to contain the multiple derivation paths, separated by `,`. So it would look something like:\r\n```\r\nxpub...{0,1}/*\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\ncc @sipa ",

          "body": "This PR fixes certain use-cases when **send-to-self** transactions are missing from `listtransactions` output.\r\n\r\n1. When a receiving address is generated externally to the wallet\r\n(e.g. same wallet running on two nodes, or by 3rd party from xpub)\r\n2. When restoring backup with lost metadata, but keypool gap is not exceeded yet\r\n\r\nWhen the block is connected or tx added to mempool we already mark used keys. This PR extends this logic to determine whether the destination is a receiving one and if yes add it to the address book with empty label.\r\n\r\nWorks both for legacy and descriptors wallets.\r\n- For legacy it uses the internal flag from the keypool entry. Caveat: because we don't know which script type would be used we add all possible destinations for such keys.\r\n- For descriptor wallets it uses internal flag for the script pub key manager. Caveat: it only works for active descriptors.\r\n\r\nfixes #19856\r\nfixes #20293",
