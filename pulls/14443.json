Its primary purpose right now is to be passed into ATMP while testing acceptance of several (potentially depending) transaction and then to be discarded.\r\n\r\nOne use case could be to determine if smart contracts that are set up with multiple txs would be accepted by current consensus and policy rules.\r\n\r\nIn the future it could be extended to support recursive wrapping of layers or a way to commit changes that happened in the layer to the underlying pool or layer. Furthermore, it could be extended to be revivable after changes to the underlying layer happened. (As opposed to be single-use)",

This leaves the next 64 (or 56 depending if final chunk) open for data. In the case of the script execution cache, this does not make a big performance improvement because the nonce was already properly padded to fit into one buffer, but does make the code a little simpler. In the case of the sig cache, this should reduce the hashing overhead slightly because we are less likely to need an additional processing step.\r\n\r\nI haven't benchmarked this, but back of the envelope it should reduce the hashing by one buffer for all combinations except compressed public keys with compact signatures.",

After this PR, wallet code no longer accesses global variables declared outside the wallet directory, and no longer calls functions accessing those globals (as verified by the `hide-globals` script in #10244).\r\n\r\nThis PR and the previous PRs have been refactoring changes that do not affect behavior. Previous PRs have consisted of lots of mechanical changes like:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    wtx.nTimeReceived = GetAdjustedTime();\r\n+    wtx.nTimeReceived = m_chain->getAdjustedTime();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is smaller, but less mechanical. It replaces last few bits of wallet code that access node state directly (through `CValidationInterface`, `CRPCTable`, and `CCoinsViewMemPool` interfaces) with code that uses the `Chain` interface.\r\n\r\nThese changes allow followup PR #10102 (multiprocess gui & wallet PR) to work without any significant updates to wallet code. Additionally they:\r\n\r\n* Provide a single place to describe the interface between wallet and node code.\r\n* Can make better wallet testing possible, because the `Chain` object consists of virtual methods that can be overloaded for mocking. (This could be used to test edge cases in the rescan code, for example).",

      "body": "@fanquake Thanks for communicating the rationale clearly. That brings transparency to your maintainer work.\r\n\r\nSince the maintainer role is a commission of trust I think it is crucial that the decision process is clear and that the maintainer is ready to bring clarity if needed by answering questions about his/her decisions.\r\n\r\nFWIW: I think you're doing a great job with labelling the PR:s. I'm continually impressed by how quickly you do the labelling. Talking about that, did you see [my curious question in #14239](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14239#issuecomment-425807696) on how to label PR:s fixing undefined behaviour (\"bugs\" vs \"refactoring\")? Not a big issues obviously but it would be nice to have it clarified. More communication is better than less communication when it comes to maintainership :-)\r\n\r\nThanks!",
