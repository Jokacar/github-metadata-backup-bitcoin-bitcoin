    "title": "RFC: Misused LogError and LogWarning macros",
    "body": "As a programmer, when I see `LogError` and `LogWarning` macros, I assume `LogError` should be used to log information about a failure that happened, and `LogWarning` should be used to log information about an unusual condition which happened that might indicate a real problem depending on other factors and intent.\r\n\r\nBut [developer notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b27afb7fb774809c9c075d56e44657e0b607a00c/doc/developer-notes.md#logging) suggest very different meanings for these macros. They say `LogError` should be used for \"severe problems that require the node (or a subsystem) to shut down entirely (e.g., insufficient storage space)\" and that `LogWarning` should be used \"for severe problems that the node admin should address, but are not severe enough to warrant shutting down the node (e.g., system time appears to be wrong, unknown soft fork appears to have activated).\"\r\n\r\nI think the distinction the developer notes makes and the levels it defines are useful, but the current names make it likely that the macros will be used incorrectly.\r\n\r\nSo while the macros are new, I think it would be good to give them clearer names and I would suggest:\r\n\r\n- `LogFatal` for severe problems that require the node or a subsystem to shut down entirely, and\r\n- `LogCritical` for severe problems that the node admin should address, but do not warrant shutting down\r\n\r\nLooking at the code I found 58 cases where `LogError` and `Level::Error` appeared to be use correctly, in conditions that would lead to full or partial shutdowns, and 71 cases where it appeared to be used incorrectly to report errors that would not cause shutdowns and were potentially transient.\r\n\r\nCurrent `LogWarning` and `Level::Warn` usages were better but more rare, with 8 correct uses and 4 incorrect ones.\r\n\r\nI think before more code is written and ported to use the new macros, we should give them better names that will accurately reflect what the log messages mean and how the macros are intended to be used.\r\n\r\nI wrote #30347 to address this, clarifying documentation, and using LogFatal and LogCritical names suggested above, but I am interested to know if there other ideas for different names or better approaches. Or if there is not a real issue here and the current names should be kept. #30361 is another possible approach.",

But I think it can be useful in many cases to log the errors as well, or in some cases not try to return very granular error information, but just indicate that a failure happened and refer the user to check the debug log.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30348#issuecomment-2194707816\r\n\r\nI think I disagree somewhat with Jon. I like the new logging API overall and think new documentation is well written, giving good advice and making clear distinctions that should lead to less spammy logging. I just think two of the macros happen to have unfortunate names that don't match how they are intended to be used.\r\n\r\nI do agree with the concern about having a proliferation of log macros. But I think the intent behind the macros is that `LogDebug` should be the most commonly one used by far. Unconditional `LogInfo` `LogCritical` and `LogFatal` macros should be used more rarely, to avoid log spam. And `LogTrace` should only be used in complicated code where it's helpful to have fine traces. My PR #30347 does keep `LogWarning` and `LogError` macros for now, but I think it might make more sense to get rid of them and shift more code to using `LogDebug`.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I particularly agree the current implementation of the macros is complicated and inconsistent, and I wrote #29256 to make all the macros accept the same parameters and use the [same implementation](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/38d3298ea7e547797871140a02df3e7d60d34d36/src/logging.h#L322-L327). I just don't see a significant distinction between different syntaxes `LogDebug(...)` or `LogPrint(BCLog::Debug, ...)` or even `log.Debug(...)` so have not been trying to raise syntax as an issue.\r\n\r\n(EDIT: To be clear, I personally prefer brevity and efficiency of the macro syntax over the other syntaxes. I am just trying to be sympathetic to Jon's point of view while pointing out that his preference for level arguments is only a preference for a different syntax, and he doesn't need to be so concerned about the existence of convenience macros. I think this one criticism is little shallow, but the other points he makes are more meaningful.)",

I also found more incorrect uses that I missed before because I was only searching for `LogWarning` not `Level::Warning`. #30347 has been updated to reflect these changes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30348#issuecomment-2195538575 \r\n\r\n> Two years ago, it seemed we had a road map on severity-level logging based on a PR discussion. It turned out not to be the case, and not sufficiently specified, with subsequent proposals to swerve here or take another road there.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely true, but I think it is mostly ok and has been beneficial. The decision to only use `Level::Error` for fatal errors was definitely very surprising to me, I only found out about it yesterday! But I think most changes have been solid improvements.\r\n\r\nI agree it would be good to discuss severity levels somewhere if people disagree about them, though I'm not sure they actually do. AJ posted a [helpful chart](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30347#discussion_r1657886163) that shows how the levels are supposed to be used, and I think it makes perfect sense as a recommendation for what levels to use in new code, even if it doesn't describe how log levels are used in a lot of existing code.\r\n\r\nThis issue is just about making names used in the code match intent of the code, so it may not be best place to discuss bigger topics, but I hope people will open other issues and PRs if there are more improvements that can be made.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30348#issuecomment-2195019443\r\n\r\n> #30347 doesn't seem to actually fix any of the 61 incorrect cases?\r\n\r\nIt fixes them by no longer misusing the name \"Error\" to mean fatal error, and the name \"Warning\" to mean critical condition that requires action from the user. So the logging in those cases is correct, even if it goes against new best practices we are recommending for logging. I think in most or all of those cases, the log messages are older than the recommendations are, so I did not take it upon myself to update them.\r\n\r\n> Maybe have a PR to manually fix the incorrect ones, then a scripted diff to convert everything to the new names?\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me what you mean by manually fixing the incorrect ones, but I would be happy to go with a different approach if you want to implement it, or specify what you mean by \"fix.\" I provided a pretty detailed rationale for the approach I took in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30347#discussion_r1658862564, replying to your other comment (which I appreciate by the way, I do think it would be good to reduce the number of severity levels and the amount of log spam).",
