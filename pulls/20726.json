We get clearer visibility into what currently lies in consensus codepaths **and** what depends on our consensus engine\r\n> 1. We can coalesce duplicate consensus initialization codepaths, mitigating against bugs that arise out of test/non-test initialization inconsistencies\r\n\r\n### De-globalizing `g_chainman`\r\n\r\nExcerpt from #20049\r\n> In order to modularize our consensus engine, we need to first de-globalize the global `ChainstateManager` -- namely `g_chainman` -- as it and its dependencies are what makes up the bulk of our consensus engine. A few direct references to `g_chainman` have already been removed in #19927, however, its indirect uses (mainly via `::Chain(state|)Active()`) are numerous in our codebase and often used to ~~cheat~~ avoid obtaining a `ChainstateManager` reference.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis changeset moves the global `ChainstateManger` to `NodeContext` and removes `::Chain{state,}Active()` as a first step towards better modularization of our consensus engine. \r\n\r\nThe commits are ordered as such:\r\n1. Fixes to our existing codebase crucial to subsequent changes in this changeset\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...dongcarl:2020-10-chainman-fixes\r\n1. Remove all references to `g_chainman`, `::Chain{state,}Active()`\r\n\t1. In `src/validation.{cpp,h}`\r\n\t\t1. In a bundle of functions related to `::LookupBlockIndex` in the call graph\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/2020-10-chainman-fixes...dongcarl:2020-09-libbitcoinruntime-v4\r\n\t\t1. In a bundle of functions that are mempool-related\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/dongcarl:2020-09-libbitcoinruntime-v4...2020-09-reduce-validation-mempool-ccsactiveglobal-usage\r\n\t\t1.

In `src/test`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/wallet/test`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/qt/test`\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n- The above ordering is constructed according to the overall call graph of our codebase such that we avoid touching the same function/module twice. \r\n- Due to the length of this overall change, each commit aims to be trivially-reviewable and only requires the reviewer to reason about the correctness of one function/module at a time.\r\n- There are a lot of review-only assertions which can be used to check for correctness. They are removed in 2236237070a45fe570cd0113f0025b0a46ac89be.\r\n",

It also adds a bunch of documentation. \r\n\r\nThis PR changes the following:\r\n1. prevents short-lived ADDR_FETCH and FEELER connections from affecting our further peer selection, because they are short-lived and should not matter\r\n2. ~~ADDR_FETCH and FEELER conns are now not included in `count_failure` consideration (see new documentation). Even though it *makes sense* to consider them if they are present at the moment of the call, we should not rely on that luck. Instead, we should be explicit.~~\r\n3. ~Prevents BLOCK_RELAY connections from affecting our further full-relay peer selection, because otherwise, an attacker with sufficient ADDR-related capabilities may infer to which netgroups those (supposedly more private) connections belong.~ Abandoning this feature for now because the trade-offs are unclear, see P2P meeting at #bitcoin-core-dev from Sept. 8.\r\n4. Look at the existing MANUAL peers when enforcing diversity of new outbound conns.\r\n\r\n~I’m also not sure whether *new* BLOCK_RELAY connections should be distinct w.r.t *existent* full outbound connections. Seems like another influence vector for an attacker with AddrMan poisoning capabilities, but this threat is probably too advanced. And having a good diversity of BLOCK_RELAY conns is very beneficial.~",

          "body": "The existing functional test framework uses the `addnode` RPC to spin up manual connections between bitcoind nodes. This limits our ability to add integration tests for our networking code, which often executes different code paths for different connection types. \r\n\r\n**This PR enables creating `outbound` & `block-relay-only` P2P connections in the functional tests.** This allows us to increase our p2p test coverage, since we can now verify expectations around these connection types.\r\n\r\nThis builds out the [prototype](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14210#issuecomment-527421978) proposed by ajtowns in #14210. 🙌🏽\r\n\r\nAn overview of this branch:\r\n- introduces a new test-only RPC function `addconnection` which initiates opening an `outbound` or `block-relay-only` connection. (conceptually similar to `addnode` but for different connection types & restricted to regtest)\r\n- adds `test_framework` support so a mininode can open an `outbound`/`block-relay-only` connection to a `P2PInterface`/`P2PConnection`.\r\n- updates `p2p_blocksonly` tests to create a `block-relay-only` connection & verify expectations around transaction relay. \r\n- introduces `p2p_add_connections` test that checks the behaviors of the newly introduced `add_outbound_p2p_connection` test framework function. \r\n\r\nWith these changes, there are many more behaviors that we can add integration tests for. The blocksonly updates is just one example. \r\n\r\nHuge props to ajtowns for conceiving the approach & providing me feedback as I've built out this branch. Also thank you to jnewbery for lots of thoughtful input along the way. ",

Is that worth pointing out (e.g. \"Peers MAY decide to not serve peers that announce this flag\").\r\n\r\nShould interaction with tx-relay specific other messages like mempool, filterload, filteradd, filterclear, feefilter be specified (e.g. these messages are disabled/forbidden/ignored on block only connections)?\r\n\r\nMaybe it's worth pointing out that blocktxn/getblocktxn still function?",

      "body": "@sipa Thanks for taking a look!\r\n\r\n> If I understand it correctly, the BIP idea doesn't concern itself with this being outbound->inbound or not, but the implementation only ever announces it in the outbound direction, and will disconnect if it's received from a (full) outbound peer. Is that worth pointing out (e.g. \"Peers MAY decide to not serve peers that announce this flag\").\r\n\r\nYes good observation.  When I was working on this, I realized that there was no protocol need to restrict this as being a message from inbound->outbound peer, so while I didn't have an immediate use case for outbound peers sending this message to inbound ones, I also thought there seemed to be little downside to permitting it in the future.\r\n\r\nThe only case where I thought it could be problematic is if we connect out to a peer that we expect to be a full-relay peer, and it turns out the peer tells us we won't get any transactions from them -- in this case I think we ought to disconnect.  (Arguably it's a bug that today we don't do this when we get fRelay=false from such a peer in their version message.)\r\n\r\nI'll update the BIP to reflect that peers should feel free to use this information in deciding who to stay connected to.\r\n\r\n> Should interaction with tx-relay specific other messages like mempool, filterload, filteradd, filterclear, feefilter be specified (e.g. these messages are disabled/forbidden/ignored on block only connections)?\r\n\r\nYes, I should both specify that those messages are not permitted, and I think disconnect peers who send them to us after negotiating BLOCKRELAY. I think this will require an extra piece of state for outbound peers who might send us a BLOCKRELAY message, but that seems no big deal.\r\n \r\n> Maybe it's worth pointing out that blocktxn/getblocktxn still function?\r\n\r\nI'll update the BIP to explicitly reflect this as well.\r\n",

      "body": "> I've implemented my suggestion here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...jnewbery:2020-12-implicit-addr-relay?expand=1. It's a 20 line change, and doesn't seem too complex.\r\n\r\nThe downside to an approach like this (for both `m_addr_known` and `m_tx_relay`) is that we don't get the benefit of limiting and bounding the resources that will be used on the peer at the time of connection.  Adding a p2p message that is sent at the start of a connection (such as the one proposed here) allows us to do that.  Once we have a way to bound the resources of a peer that is connecting to us with this intent, I plan to propose that we increase the number of inbound connection slots that we can service, and reserve some of those for BLOCKRELAY peers.  From there, I think we could then start to increase the number of outbound block-relay-only connections we make without concern that we are taking over too many inbound connection slots on the network or using up too many node resources.\r\n\r\nFor some additional context, please see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-480400958 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19858#issuecomment-688918364.  Note also the ambiguity of our current approach to guessing that a peer is an inbound-block-relay-only peer, such as was done in #19670.",

      "body": "strong concept ACK - having connections explicitly declare expectations around what-to-relay makes a lot of sense. both for the current state as well as the future direction you've indicated.\r\n\r\nthat said, I have lots of thoughts to consider around approach :) \r\n\r\n**BIP:**\r\nmy main questions are around other use cases & long term plans. the current proposal involves sending a singular message that disables 2/3 inventory types, but what about other circumstances where a peer might not want to participate in addr or tx relay? \r\n\r\nas a current example, it would make sense for a node that has enabled `-connect` to not participate in addr relay for all the same reasons as this PR: it would blackhole any self-announcements and its unnecessary bandwidth & memory usage. \r\n\r\nbased on conversations that arose when you originally implemented block-relay-only connections, I could imagine a future where we implement connections that permit block & addr relay, but disable tx relay.\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting we need to implement all of this right away, but I'd like to understand the high level direction so we can to leave the door open for future improvements, since this BIP will set a precedence. \r\n\r\none route that makes sense to me- a message format that enables peers to signal which inventory types they would like to subscribe to (or unsubscribe from). either as separate messages, or a single message with multiple fields. if we go an opt-in route, we could also defer initializing the relevant data structures (`m_tx_relay` & `m_addr_known`) until we receive the message indicating the peer wants to relay that type of message. \r\n\r\nI think this might be similar to ideas that john & aj have touched on in their reviews. \r\n\r\n**Implementation: Approach** \r\n- I think I agree with aj's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20726#discussion_r548346466 that `INBOUND_BLOCK_RELAY` might be better represented as the `INBOUND` connection type with the additional state maintaining if tx/addr relay is enabled. I believe it would reduce the diff, and in the places where we want to discern the two, the additional check of data structures is useful / relevant anyways.\r\n\r\nI was looking into the `m_tx_relay` and `m_addr_known` data structures, trying to come up with ideas for improving the code paths. (I introduced some of the current state, but its not great.) I also saw your proposal and the review conversation in #20676. I don't have any amazing solutions, but I have one or two thoughts to consider: \r\n- whatever route we go, would be nice if `m_tx_relay` and `m_addr_known` are handled similarly. right now they are a bit out of sync (eg. the check for instantiating in the constructor)\r\n- one option: `CNode` constructor checks connection types to decide whether or not to instantiate the object, and the `Relay[xxxx]WithConn()` function can check for presence of the object. I think that would mean the connection type -> data structure relationship is only defined once, the structures could be deallocated without problems, and we have code safety of not dereferencing null pointers without needing to blur the layers? \r\n- as I already mentioned, I like the idea around deferring the creation of these structures.\r\n\r\n**Implementation: Specifics**\r\n(sorry if its too early for some of these comments) \r\n- we'll definitely need to fix the remote crash bug :) \r\n- if we do keep `INBOUND_BLOCK_RELAY` as a separate connection type, might be worth adding to the check here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net.cpp#L2200 \r\n- the `IsBlockOnlyConn` function is now extra confusing. It should either be updated to return both types, or the name changed (probably the latter). \r\n\r\n**Questions** \r\n- #19670 introduced a workaround to deduce inbound block-relay-only peers and protect them from eviction. After this PR, do you think we could revisit to make it more direct? ",

          "body": "This is an implementation of [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518), using primitives in the BIP-330 (see the updated spec [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki)). Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk on the topic is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670).\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I'll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n- save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n- increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n- improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\nObviously looking for review, let's try to start with a high-level concerns, and keep nits for later.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nPlease don't be scared of 8,000 LOC added. 7,000 of them is minisketch added as a subtree.\r\n\r\nP.P.S.\r\nMy experiments of running this code live (slightly outdated) with a script to replicate the experiment: [here1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#issuecomment-599241490) and [here2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#issuecomment-600388543).\r\n",

Maybe the BIP should have a section explaining that block-relay is the primary traffic class and that a peer can only escalate from there (e.g to addr-relay by sending after a ADDRRELAY).\r\n\r\nBut this direction may have issues. E.g if a future p2p extension governing addr-relay is neutral for block-relay, how would you enable persistent addr-relay-only connections ? ",

It also avoids any confusion about how this mechanism interacts with possible future features.",

      "body": "Thanks all for the comments so far.  I've renamed the p2p message to \"disabletx\" to more clearly communicate what the effect of processing this message is.  Current draft is here: https://github.com/sdaftuar/bips/blob/2020-09-negotiate-block-relay/bip-disable-tx.mediawiki\r\n\r\nSome highlights, besides the message being renamed:\r\n * I've made it more explicit that the BIP37-related messages are disallowed\r\n * I've clarified that addr messages should be avoided for now, but could be sent/received if in the future we deploy a way to negotiate addr relay explicitly.  This accommodates existing software behavior without preventing us from cleanly separating these two ideas in the future.\r\n\r\nI don't think it makes sense to add a \"sendblocks\" p2p message, because there is no use case I'm aware of for connections on the p2p network to not want blocks (really, headers or block hashes, because unrequested blocks are themselves not widely supported on the network).  If there were such a use case, someone should feel free to propose this.  For now, I think it's sufficient for this use case -- of negotiating block-relay-only connections -- to disable transaction relay, and listening nodes can use the disabling of transaction relay as proposed here as a proxy for \"block-relay-only\" connections, to facilitate increased connection limits in the future.\r\n\r\nI do think that adding a way to opt-in to addr relay is desirable, however I think more research is required to figure out what that should look like.  Naively, I'd think it makes sense to opt-in to addr-relay on a per-network-type basis (as described in BIP 155), but how exactly that should work is intertwined with what relay strategies might make sense, and I would not feel comfortable proposing anything at this time (for instance, I'd say that we should clarify what the goals of address relay are, analyze what kinds of relay strategies optimize for that goal along with any DoS tradeoffs that might be introduced, and then determine what our own implementation might look like, before we finalize a specification).  If someone wants to work on such a proposal, I would encourage it.  However the current BIP was drafted with the goal of being compatible with any future work in this area so I don't think this should be a blocker.\r\n\r\nI'll wait a bit for more comments here, but my plan is to share this with the bitcoin-dev list soon and then return to the implementation questions that have come up so far.",

After this PR, do you think we could revisit to make it more direct?\r\n\r\nI think we would wait until this has been deployed for a while and then (potentially) change the eviction logic.  Two things occur to me on this point:\r\n- Older software will continue to use the old way of (not) communicating their intentions, via the fRelayTxes flag. So to accommodate older software we may not want to switch to keying off this p2p message for a little while at least.\r\n- It seems most of the feedback has been to shy away from encoding overly broad semantics into a single p2p message; while I think that is fine it also means that from our peer's point of view, they will have to infer the connection \"type\" from the properties of the peer, rather than from the peer declaring its full intentions in a single message.  I think for now we can treat \"will never relay txes\" as essentially synonymous with these block-relay connections, but perhaps in the future there will be some distinction, and all a peer can do is rely on some set of flags that it might use to preference some peers over others -- which might put us exactly back to where we are today, with us just keying off of whether fRelayTxes is false, anyway.\r\n",

      "body": "> > a block-relay-only connection today, our peer doesn't know that we don't want addr relay on the link\r\n> \r\n> These seem like they're conceptually different topics, and treating them as the same seems like an implementation-specific thing...\r\n> \r\n\r\n> I agree with some of the other comments here that it seems too implementation-specific to encode \"relay blocks, don't relay txs, don't relay addrs\" in a single P2P message.\r\n\r\n@jnewbery @luke-jr I'm a bit confused about both of your critiques of this as too \"implementation-specific\".  The goal of the this BIP process is to standardize/formalize these block-relay-only connections in a useful way -- in my view, this behavior has been a good thing to introduce and we want to make more of these connections and so it is worth standardizing.  \r\n\r\nSo I think the question is what is the best way to include this in the protocol.  I think there are some good reasons to make this narrowly tailored to the exact thing we need -- disabling of transaction relay -- but we should be mindful that comes with some cost to how these connections can be understood by the recipient (now and going forward as the p2p protocol evolves), and therefore code complexity in the implementation.  At any rate, I think I'm happy with the latest draft that spells out clearly that transaction relay must be disabled, and address relay is discouraged in the absence of any explicit negotiation for it (leaving the door open for a future addr relay protocol to govern addr behavior).\r\n\r\n> What is the purpose of compactblocks without transaction-relay traffic?\r\n\r\n@luke-jr You asked this question back when block-relay-only connections were introduced (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-484634796), and I answered this question back then as well (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-484666402).  Nodes using these connections are welcome to also have full-relay connections to other peers, and therefore we might expect compact block relay to work just fine over block-relay-only links.  I would recommend looking at the logs of your own node(s) to see how well compact block relay works on the existing block-relay-only peers that we have; in my experience it works quite well with some block-relay-only peers being selected as HB peers (and vice versa).\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the BIP, software would be free to implement this proposal and not BIP 152, and just rely on `getdata` messages to request blocks.  Acceptance of this proposed BIP does not require acceptance/implementation of BIP 152.\r\n\r\n> > In the future, we can also save a bit of memory by not allocating (or deallocating) the peer data structures we maintain for transaction and address relay.\r\n> Can't we do that today, just by not allocating it until we know the peer wants it?\r\n\r\nAs I mention above, the goal is to be able to bound a peer's resource utilization at the time the connection is completed.  It would be unfortunate if a peer enabled tx relay later in a connection's lifetime and suddenly got disconnected just because we attempted to move it from one accounting bucket to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "It seems more natural to treat the \"subversion\" field (=user agent string, see [BIP 14](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0014.mediawiki#Proposal)) of a node as pure string rather than a bytestring within the test framework. This is also suggested with the naming prefix in `msg_version.strSubVer`: one probably wouldn't expect a field starting with \"str\" to be a bytestring that needs further decoding to be useful. This PR moves the encoding/decoding parts to the serialization/deserialization routines so that the user doesn't have to bother with that anymore.\r\n\r\nNote that currently, in the master branch the `msg_version.strSubVer` is never read (only in `msg_version.__repr__`); However, one issue that is solved by this PR came up while testing #19509 (not merged yet): A decoding script for binary message capture files takes use of the functional test framework convert it into JSON format. Bytestrings will be convered to hexstrings, while pure strings will (surprise surprise) end up without modification in the file.\r\n\r\nSo without this patch, we get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ jq . out.json | grep -m5 strSubVer\r\n      \"strSubVer\": \"2f5361746f7368693a32312e39392e302f\"\r\n      \"strSubVer\": \"2f5361746f7368693a302e32302e312f\"\r\n      \"strSubVer\": \"2f5361746f7368693a32312e39392e302f\"\r\n      \"strSubVer\": \"2f5361746f7368693a302e32302e312f\"\r\n      \"strSubVer\": \"2f5361746f7368693a32312e39392e302f\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this patch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ jq . out2.json | grep -m5 strSubVer\r\n      \"strSubVer\": \"/Satoshi:21.99.0/\"\r\n      \"strSubVer\": \"/Satoshi:0.20.1/\"\r\n      \"strSubVer\": \"/Satoshi:21.99.0/\"\r\n      \"strSubVer\": \"/Satoshi:0.20.1/\"\r\n      \"strSubVer\": \"/Satoshi:21.99.0/\"\r\n```\r\n",

That means that `PeerManager` truly is net_processing's minimal interface to expose to the rest of the program.\r\n- If a test needs to directly manipulate `Peer` objects, it can do so, since they're exposed in peerman_impl header.

This PR moves test framework specific constants to p2p.py.\r\n\r\nIt also changes the SUBVERSION constant to be a string instead of a bytes object. That means that it needs to be explicitly converted to a bytes object to serialize into a version message. Failing to do so would cause an easy-to-spot bug. This should avoid silent failures like the one solved in #20522.\r\n",

Even if the bip stays as is, we might want to disallow `tx` messages as well, or is there some downside I am missing?\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke The intent is to disallow sending a tx on such a link -- already it's the case that if we receive a transaction from a block-relay-only outbound peer that we'll disconnect them.  Once we no longer instantiate the `m_tx_relay` structure for inbound peers sending us `disabletx`, the existing code would already disconnect such a peer that sends an unrequested tx as well; but I will go ahead and implement that behavior in this PR as well because that is indeed an oversight. Thanks for noticing this!",

          "title": "[p2p] Reduce addr blackholes ",
          "body": "This PR builds on the test refactors extracted into #22306 (first 5 commits). \r\n\r\nThis PR aims to reduce addr blackholes. When we receive an `addr` message that contains 10 or less addresses, we forward them to 1-2 peers. This is the main technique we use for self advertisements, so sending to peers that wouldn't relay would effectively \"blackhole\" the trickle. Although we cannot prevent this in a malicious case, we can improve it for the normal, honest cases, and reduce the overall likelihood of occurrence. Two known cases where peers would not participate in addr relay are if they have connected to you as a block-relay-only connection, or if they are a light client. \r\n\r\nThis implementation defers initialization of `m_addr_known` until it is needed, then uses its presence to decide if the peer is participating in addr relay. For outbound (not block-relay-only) peers, we initialize the filter before sending the initial self announcement when processing their `version` message. For inbound peers, we initialize the filter if/when we get an addr related message (`ADDR`, `ADDRV2`, `GETADDR`). We do NOT initialize the filter based on a `SENDADDRV2` message. \r\n\r\nTo communicate about these changes beyond bitcoin core & to (try to) ensure that no other software would be disrupted, I have: \r\n- Posted to the [mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018784.html)\r\n- Researched other open source clients to confirm compatibility, opened issues in all the projects & documented in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528#issuecomment-809906430. Many have confirmed that this change would not be problematic.\r\n- Raised as topic during [bitcoin-core-dev meeting](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2021-03-25.html#l-954)\r\n- Raised as topic during [bitcoin p2p meeting](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2021-04-20.html#l-439)",

They were introduced in #15759.\r\n\r\nWhen creating an outbound block-relay-only connection, since we know that we're never going to announce transactions over that connection, we can save on memory usage by not a `TxRelay` data structure for that connection. When receiving an inbound connection, we don't know whether the connection was opened by the peer as block-relay-only or not, and therefore we always construct a `TxRelay` data structure for inbound connections.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible to tell whether an inbound connection will ever request that we start announcing transactions to it. The `fRelay` field in the `version` message may be set to `0` to indicate that the peer does not wish to receive transaction announcements. The peer may later request that we start announcing transactions to it by sending a `filterload` or `filterclear` message, **but only if we have offered `NODE_BLOOM` services to that peer**. `NODE_BLOOM` services are disabled by default, and it has been recommended for some time that users not enable `NODE_BLOOM` services on public connections, for privacy and anti-DoS reasons.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we have not offered `NODE_BLOOM` to the peer _and_ it has set `fRelay` to `0`, then we know that it will never request transaction announcements, and that we can save resources by not initializing the `TxRelay` data structure.",

          "title": "Erlay: bandwidth-efficient transaction relay protocol",
          "body": "I started forking off parts of this big PR so that we can review and merge in chunks with better efficiency.\r\n1. [p2p: Erlay support signaling](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23443) — done\r\n2. [Follow-up](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26359) — done\r\n3. [p2p: Fill reconciliation sets and request reconciliation (Erlay)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26283) — pending\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nPlease use this discussion for high-level topics and keep the nitpics for the sub-PRs. The state of this branch might be not the cleanest and the freshest, although last time I rebased in on 2022/05/12 to be in sync {with master, with the latest child PR} and pass CI (modulo one race condition issue).\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation of  [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518) , using primitives in the BIP-330 (see the updated spec  [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki) ). Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670) .\r\n\r\nThis PR supersedes the previous [one](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261), because that one got too much review comments (I tried to resolve all of them for this version), and also it was much refactored since then.\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I’ll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n* save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n* increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n* improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\n### How to review\r\n\r\nI suggest doing `make clean && autogen.sh && configure` before you try building it locally.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nI created 2 discussion boards, please discuss not-code-related topics there:\r\n1. [Understanding bandwidth savings](https://github.com/naumenkogs/txrelaysim/issues/7)\r\n2. [Joining mainnet testing](https://github.com/naumenkogs/txrelaysim/issues/8)",

      "body": "> If so, I agree that if we're connected to an upgraded peer, we should send fRelay=false as an alternative mechanism to disable transaction relay messages on the connection. However, if we want to deprecate fRelay in the future once BIP338 is deployed, I think we should not treat fRelay as a required part of the spec.\r\n\r\n@ariard Deprecating `fRelay` doesn't seem very likely to me as something we will try to do, just because it seems like it potentially breaks any software that may have implemented BIP 60 for basically no benefit.  Maybe no such software exists, but it just doesn't seem worth the effort to try to determine whether that is true, particularly if getting it wrong would be hard to know and would have unfortunate consequences on the network graph (while getting it right has no real benefit).\r\n\r\nSo while I could change the BIP to be more agnostic, and just require `fRelay=false` if `fRelay` is sent at all, that seems less useful than just requiring `fRelay` to be sent instead.  Note that no other parts of BIP 37 are required, so effectively this BIP would be just building off of BIP 60 -- which I think is the safest assumption about what will be compatible with other software on the network.",

This is only possible for taproot inputs, as taproot spends may look identical for \"dumb wallets\" and \"smart contracts\" iff they use the key-path spend.\r\n\r\nSequence-based locking has minimally lower anti-fee sniping guarantees if all the txs that created the inputs aren't itself locked to the block they were included in. However, the minimal degradation should be acceptable, given that anti-fee-snipe will set the locktime to the past of 10% of the txs anyway.",

Maybe no such software exists, but it just doesn't seem worth the effort to try to determine whether that is true, particularly if getting it wrong would be hard to know and would have unfortunate consequences on the network graph (while getting it right has no real benefit).\r\n\r\nWhile I think there is a minimal benefit to prune out old p2p logic, at least to decrease future maintenance costs, I agree that we don't have a formalized p2p features deprecation process, minimizing disruption risks for external softwares silently relying on the `fRelay` behavior.",

The main description of the PR could probably use some updates -- this isn't a draft, it could link to the bips repo now, and it's already got plenty of concept acks? \r\n\r\nComments on other comments: I think it would only make sense to deprecate `fRelay` as part of switching to a new \"p2p v2\" protocol.\r\n\r\nRest is I guess more about the bip/spec than the code per se.\r\n\r\nThe bip currently specifies \"A node that has sent or received a disabletx message to/from a peer MUST NOT send any of these messages to the peer:\"\r\n\r\nI think it would be better for that to be asymmetric, that is to say:\r\n\r\n* a node that has _**received**_ a disabletx message from a peer (`m_disable_tx == true`) MUST NOT _**send**_ INV/NOTFOUND messages for tx data, or TX messages to a peer; and\r\n* a node that has _**sent**_ a disabletx message to a peer (`IsBlockOnlyConn()`) MUST NOT _**send**_ GETDATA for tx/merkleblock data, FILTERADD/FILTERLOAD/FILTERCLEAR or MEMPOOL messages.\r\n\r\nIn that case, if an inbound blocks only node sends you a disabletx message, you can avoid allocating the TxRelay structure for that node saving memory, and also save bandwidth by avoiding sending INVs etc to that node; but if that inbound node is running in `-blocksonly=1` mode, it can still send the occasional tx to you which you can relay on to the rest of the network.\r\n\r\nLetting `-blocksonly=1` nodes free up resources seems worth the slight extra complexity to me, but ymmv I guess.\r\n\r\nNOTFOUND behaviour isn't mentioned in the bip.\r\n\r\nI guess \"It is RECOMMENDED [you don't send addr/getaddr/addrv2 if you sent/received disabletx]\" is stronger than I'd choose; and I don't think it's exactly what we implement, but overall agree with [sdaftuar's comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20726#issuecomment-1006005523).",

I do think that bandwidth is perhaps the least important network resource to worry about (memory seems very important, as does CPU).  I think the goal is to make it so that in non-adversarial situations, the additional resources used by adding additional DISABLETX connection slots is something that node operators wouldn't really notice -- so that there's no issue with adding additional block-relay-only connections to the network graph.\r\n\r\nI think `-blocksonly=1` peers are somewhere in between; they should allow for less memory but also more bandwidth if they are sometimes relaying full blocks and addrs.  Maybe that's fine as long as the CPU usage is still low?\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I assume `-blocksonly=1` is a relatively uncommon mode, so I'm not sure how important this is to optimize for.  If we changed the semantics to not relay transactions at all (or offered a mode where that was the case) then it's probably fine to start using DISABLETX on all the connections for such a peer.  With the current behavior, I also think it's fine for `-blocksonly=1` peers to have their regular connections be treated the same as (say) a node with an infinite minrelayfee/feefilter setting.  \r\n\r\n> Should DISABLETX also forbid BLOCK/GETDATA(block) messages in that case?\r\n\r\nI do think it's important not to ban GETDATA(block) traffic on block-relay-only links, because the whole point is to serve as an emergency fallback to keep the network in sync if there's some kind of attack happening.  The way I think about this is that we want the normal, non-adversarial case to be very low total network overhead for having these connections (memory, bandwidth, cpu, etc) but in the adversarial case, it's fine if node resource usage might go up a bit because then we're also getting an important benefit (and you'd figure that having defenses against such attacks makes it unappealing to try).",

      "body": "> At any rate, I assume `-blocksonly=1` is a relatively uncommon mode,\r\n\r\nYeah, I think that might be the key point. Probably `-blocksonly=1` isn't that attractive in general: if you want to be quick to get blocks, you want to get txs and do compact blocks; if you want to not use much resources, you probably want headers only, or to tunnel info directly rather than be on the open p2p network; if you want to just minimise requirements for a full p2p node, you probably just want a smaller but non-zero mempool... Provided `-blocksonly=1` nodes are only a very small proportion of the network, it doesn't seem super worthwhile optimising for the resources they use on other nodes. And if we did want to optimise for them, we could have them only have a couple of connections for relaying their own txs, and have all the rest of them be no-txs-ever connections which would let them use DISABLETX.\r\n\r\n",

It looks like there's a lot of commits, but **only the last 12 commits belong in this PR**. The rest will be merged with upstream PRs.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).\r\n\r\nBIP324 is [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki).\r\n\r\n### Running a v2 node\r\n#### Get the code\r\n```\r\ngit remote add bip324 git@github.com:dhruv/bitcoin.git\r\ngit fetch bip324\r\ngit checkout bip324/bip324-enable\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Build for your OS\r\n\r\nFollow the appropriate instructions [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md)\r\n\r\n#### Run the node\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoind -conf=CONFIG_FILE -v2transport=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Connect with a friend's v2 node\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -conf=CONFIG_FILE addnode \"FRIEND_IP:FRIEND_PORT\" \"add\" true\r\n```\r\nThe last parameter(`p2p_v2:true`) signals to your node that the peer is running a v2 supportive client and we should attempt to make an encrypted P2P connection (you're simulating the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag advertisement manually). Should that fail however (say because the peer told you mistakenly, lied, etc.), this code will downgrade the connection to unencrypted v1 transport.\r\n\r\n### Things you are helpful to test\r\n\r\n* If your friend's node is a v2 node, you can see with wireshark that the bytes are pseudorandom (the easiest way to confirm this is that with a v1 connection, wireshark will tell you it has detected a Bitcoin connection and it'll even parse out the metadata like message type, etc; with v2, wireshark has no idea -- of course that _could_ be because wireshark does simply not know v2, but it is because the bytestream is pseudorandom)\r\n* Compare the v2 encrypted session id exposed via `getpeerinfo` as `v2_session_id` with your friend.\r\n* Add another peer that is actually v1, but try `addnode` still indicating v2 support. You should see with wireshark that after a failed attempt at a v2 handshake, the connection is downgraded to unencrypted v1 and wireshark can parse it.\r\n\r\nI've been told there are v2 nodes running at (happy to update the list as more people run persistent v2 nodes; message me and I'll add it here):\r\n```\r\nbe.anyone.eu.org\r\nrp7k2go3s5lyj3fnj6zn62ktarlrsft2ohlsxkyd7v3e3idqyptvread.onion:8333\r\njdcoysubtxazi7dketpyb5rnjorvxad4onftveohash2pdwkgw4bvnqd.onion:8333\r\nxci6cphki2pdb5qe7axzrcxcxabkbm24z4zlv2hn4ziy6grquqco2kyd.onion:8333\r\nslvtesfgg3mkksqqzh67al4sq6dx3rhlzqepa4ny7jonzuckg6msf3id.onion:8333\r\ngifm4fnj3vua664xhgeanx5fnpco3txkqy4amr4txbfsciiyrkxpf2qd.onion:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::3:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::a6d6:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1a:365::2:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1b:365:aa20:66ff:fe3f:1909:8333\r\n184.74.240.157:8533\r\n95.179.145.232:8333\r\n```",

They'll all be removed when the parent PRs get merged.\r\n\r\n### commits overview\r\n1. Introducing cryptographic constructs(HKDF, ECDH, ChaCha20, Poly1305, FSChaCha20 and FSChaCha20Poly1305) in the test framework to help with P2P encryption.\r\n2. Performing v2 P2P encryption in a v2 connection.\r\n    * introduces a new class `EncryptedP2PState` to store the keys, functions for performing the initial v2 handshake and encryption/decryption.\r\n    * this class is used by `P2PConnection` in inbound/outbound connections to perform the initial v2 handshake before the v1 version handshake. Only after the initial v2 handshake is performed do application layer P2P messages(version, verack etc..) get exchanged. (in a v2 connection)\r\n    * the encrypted P2P messages follow a different format - 3 byte length + 1-13 byte message_type + payload + 16 byte MAC\r\n    * includes support for testing decoy messages and v2 connection downgrade(using false advertisement - when a v2 node makes an outbound connection to a node which doesn't support v2 but is advertised as v2 by some malicious\r\nintermediary)\r\n\r\n### run the tests\r\n* functional test - `test/functional/p2p_v2_encrypted.py` `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py`\r\n\r\nI'm also super grateful to @ dhruv for his really valuable feedback on this branch.",

That is the case for the local node selecting the peer as an outbound block-relay-only.  The `Peer`'s `m_tx_relay` is set to false in `InitializeNode` and no `TxRelay` object is instantiated. However, on the other side of the connection, the local node is seen as is `IsInboundConn()` and a `TxRelay` object allocated, allowing the send of `FEEFILTER` in `MaybeSendFeefilter`. So an outbound block-relay-only might send `FEEFILTER` messages provoking a disconnection with current code ? Or are you referencing another behavor or am I missing an interference with `fRelay` ?",

Then a block_relay_only connection comes in, and says \"oh, high version number, I'll send the DISABLETX msg\", which you then ignore. You don't send txs to them because they specified `fRelay=false`, but you do send a FEEFILTER message to them, and they then disconnect you.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be better to treat feature support and enablement separately; ie send \"disabletx false\" normally, and \"disabletx true\" for block-relay-only outbounds, with the logic being \"if both side support disabletx, and either side enables it, then don't send tx related messages and disconnect if they're received; otherwise no-op\" ?",

          "body": "The block index might contain stale blocks that are not part of the main chain. If a malicious peer is able to probe a node's block index for certain stale blocks then it can use this information to fingerprint the node.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving headers (either through a `cmpctblock` or `headers` messages) a node will send `getheaders` if the predecessor of the first header does not exist. This leaks information from the block index if the predecessor of the header is a stale block because no `getheaders` will be sent in that case revealing that the stale block exists in the index.\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents this fingerprinting by sending additional `getheaders` messages in cases where not doing so leaks the existence of stale blocks. To determine when additional messages should be send, we introduce the `PeerManagerImpl::m_chain_tips_sets` map which keeps track of seen chain tips per network, effectively creating a per network view of the node's global block index.  We only try to accept new headers if they connect to anything in our global index and they connect to our active chain or to a chain that was previously sent to us by a peer on the same network. We send a `getheaders` message should these conditions not be met.",

For example, it seems a bit confusing to disconnect `block-relay-only` peers with `relay` permission when they send a tx message, but not when they send an inv message. Also, keeping track of their inv announcements seems both wasteful and confusing, as it does nothing. This isn't possible in practice, as outbound connections do not have permissions assigned, but sees fragile to rely on.

It might make more sense to have the connection type stay as \"inbound\" but have an extra flag for \"want blocks-only behaviour\" -- that flag could just be `m_tx_relay == nullptr` at which point you don't need to have locking to keep `m_tx_relay` and `m_conn_type` in sync. You still need something to ensure you don't free `m_tx_relay` while someone else might be using it, but that could be just changing it to a `shared_ptr`?\r\n\r\nActually, perhaps `m_tx_relay` simply shouldn't be allocated until you've received their VERACK, rather than contemplating deallocating it?",

Other negotiated features that do not seem to change the connection type include `WTXIDRELAY`,`SENDADDRV2`, `SENDCMPCT`, etc.\r\n\r\nAs a starting point, I'd suggest that connection types imply (1) a different level of trust in the peer (eg. `INBOUND` vs `OUTBOUND`) or (2) connection limits(eg. 2 for `OUTBOUND_BLOCK_RELAY`, 1 for `FEELER`) and all other features are attributes of a connection.  This also opens up future possibilities for peers that want other combinations like block and addr relay, but no tx relay, etc.",

If we have a set of semantics that we understand go together for a given peer, it's nice for code readability to encode that as simply as possible.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, my intention with the BIP was to allow future flexibility for what semantics might be possible (eg my intention is to allow for addr-relay to happen in the future if we add an explicit way to negotiate addr relay, as an example), so from that perspective, having a connection type perhaps implies too much of an understanding of what the peer may be doing.  And for inbound peers in particular, we never really know what they're doing, so perhaps having more than just \"inbound\" as a connection type may be misleading to future code readers as well.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of moving initialization of `m_tx_relay` to VERACK, but not sure if I'll end up tackling that here or deferring for the current refactoring work in progress to make more headway (I think we need to add a lock that guards access to the `m_tx_relay` pointer itself?)",

Given the limits overlap a little (extra outbounds vs feelers), and what to do when you have extra peers requires looking at other data anyway, I'm not sure that's very convincing though.\r\n\r\nHmm, how much we \"trust\" a connection might change over the course of a connection in future if we allow random inbound peers to authenticate themselves to us... So I guess that leaves me thinking that we should have `const m_conn_type` representing our purpose in having the connection? (Different purposes meaning substantial changes in the protocol state machine -- eg, blocks only we deliberately opt out of tx and addr relay even if we otherwise support both, feelers we disconnect after verack, addrfetch we disconnect after getting addresses, inbounds we have different delays for and send VERSION later)\r\n\r\n> (I think we need to add a lock that guards access to the m_tx_relay pointer itself?)\r\n\r\nMaybe?

Here, net_processing is constructing a callback (`sortfunc`) which it hands to net via `ForEachNodeThen()`. In that callback, net calls into a net_processing function (`IsAddRelayPeer()`), which in turn calls into a function in the net layer (`RelayAddrsWithConn()`). This net_processing -> net -> net_processing -> net layering makes it very difficult to construct a mental model of which component is responsible for what functions, and makes future work to rationalize the interface much more difficult.",

The language currently says \r\n\r\n> If a node sets the transaction relay field in the version message to a peer to false, then the disabletx message MAY also be sent in response to a version message from that peer if the peer's protocol version is >= 70017. If sent, the disabletx message MUST be sent prior to sending a verack.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy intention was that if you didn't specify fRelay, or if you set it to true, then you MUST NOT send a disabletx message.\r\n\r\nYes my thinking was that if node software implements BIP 37, then I didn't want this to conflict with BIP37-related logic, so I tried for compatibility.  At the same time, it seemed to me that fRelay may be required by some implementations (BIP60 tried to make it so, though I don't know what other software has implemented) so I figured the simplest thing was just to require software implementing this BIP to also be sending fRelay, and therefore the value being sent should be false.\r\n\r\nIt would also be possible to completely disentangle this from BIP 37 and either ignore the fRelay field or only require it to be false if it's sent at all, but I don't know how much difference that makes.  I think the way I've done it is clear and consistent (well once I fix the language in the BIP to remove the ambiguity you point out!) but other ways would be fine too.",

If we're connected to an upgraded peer, we can ignore setting `fRelay` in our version message and just send a DISABLETX.\r\n\r\nI don't think we have specific considerations to avoid disruption BIP37-related logic, in the sense of upgrading the connection type to full-relay if they signal `fRelay=false`. Doing so would break the purpose of our block-relay-only strategy. Actually, that's what we already do, at VERSION message reception, we ignore `fRelay` if peer doesn't have a `m_tx_relay` struct.\r\n\r\nNetwork-wise,, it'll be safe to deprecate BIP37-related logic on our side (i.e don't bother sending `fRelay` even to non-upgraded peers) only once BIP338 is widely deployed. Otherwise, legacy peers will be automatically disconnected when they're picked up as block-relay-only, thus impoverishing their connection graph (only able to connect as full-relay inbound slots).\r\n\r\nNote, I think the BIP change should waiwe about the omission case, otherwise it make a requirement to implement BIP60 only for the sake of sending a `fRelay=false`, and thus create an interdependency\r\nbetween both standards ?",

However, if we want to deprecate `fRelay` in the future once BIP338 is deployed, I think we should not treat `fRelay` as a required part of the spec.\r\n\r\nTo the best of my understanding, the proposed BIP338 draft is ambiguous as it sounds to make a requirement of a `disabletx` receiving peer to support first BIP37 (\"(provided that BIP 37 or BIP 60 has been implemented\") though at the same time explicitly says those standards are independent (\"This proposal is compatible with, but independent of, BIP 37. \").\r\n\r\nI would favor to make the BIP37 deprecation option more explicit in BIP338 (i.e remove \"provided that BIP37...\") and that dual-support is an implementation choice, not a spec requirement.\r\n\r\nThat said, this comment is not a substantial blocker to me to advance this work forward.",

      "body": "The way I look at this issue is that we have two competing goals:\r\na) Have well-defined behavior on the p2p network, to limit the range of behavior and make interactions easier to reason about in the future. This tends towards being strict around deploying new specifications, both to simplify our software logic and so that when people write their own implementations, they might notice if they break something during testing.\r\n\r\nb) Avoid disconnecting peers unless it's important/we have a good reason, because otherwise, over time, the network graph will become more fragile and less partition-resistant: older software that is silently failing to stay connected to newer software will have fewer honest peers to connect to and become easier to sybil.  (As an aside: to the extent that we do sometimes disconnect peers for imperfect behavior, it can be less risky to the network if we differentiate between inbound and outbound peers, and be more tolerant of inbound peers -- this would allow slightly broken software to still find honest peers and not be partitioned off the network over time.)\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind, I'm reluctant to add new disconnection semantics for behavior that is harmless; in this case, I think it is supposed to be harmless to not have implemented BIP 338, as this is meant to be a purely optional specification.  The question to me then becomes: since we already disconnect peers for some messages if we have sent `fRelay=0`, should we add to the set of disallowed messages to such peers based on how we understand our own software to behave?\r\n\r\nI think it's a good point that those messages (tx-getdata, tx-notfound) should never come through to us if we've sent a `disabletx`, because presuming that our software isn't itself broken, we would never announce or send transactions to the peer.  However, if there is some other software on the network that is slightly broken around transaction relay and occasionally sends us a tx-getdata or tx-notfound when not appropriate, is that a big deal?  I'm not sure...\r\n\r\nFirst, changing our behavior in this way wouldn't prevent malicious peers from wasting our bandwidth (as they can do that without triggering disconnection, even without using these messages).  So instead, it would be to catch/handle broken peers and prevent them from taking up a connection slot or wasting our bandwidth.\r\n\r\nIf there is broken software out there that we know has a bug like this which causes these `fRelay=0` connections to be high bandwidth when they shouldn't be, by sending these specific p2p messages that you're suggestion we disconnect for, then I think that would be sufficient reason to do exactly what you suggest.  However, I'm not sure that we're aware of any such software.  In the absence of knowing such broken software exists, I think two other options are reasonable: a) do nothing until we notice it, or b) write smarter logic that catches the thing that I think we actually care about for these connections, which is bandwidth waste (ie seeing high traffic of bogus messages as a percentage of total traffic), and manages our connections using that metric as a factor.\r\n\r\nSo I'd say right now I'm reluctant, but not strongly opposed, to adding more disconnection criteria like you're suggesting in this PR.  However if someone proposed adding more disconnection criteria as part of a bigger resource management strategy, I think that could be totally reasonable.\r\n",
