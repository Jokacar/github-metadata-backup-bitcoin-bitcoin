    "body": "Corresponding Guix Issue: https://issues.guix.gnu.org/44559\r\n\r\nWhen supplying `--bootstrap --no-substitutes` and performing Guix builds with Guix v1.2.0, a build of `/gnu/store/vhphki5sg9xkdhh2pbc8gi6vhpfzryf0-gnutls-3.6.12.drv` will be attempted. The tests for this build will fail if your system clock is after 2020-10-24 as the certificates included in GnuTLS expires on that date ([GnuTLS ticket](https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/1230?commit_id=ed208fe55f31478732fd6cc394f9576b315a42cd)).\r\n\r\nAlthough this has been fixed in Guix master some time ago, I believe a `--bootstrap --no-substitutes` `guix pull` will attempt to bootstrap the current Guix generation first (which means it will have to build the broken `gnutls`) before updating to a new generation.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is [a workaround](https://issues.guix.gnu.org/44559#5) for this which involves stopping NTP and manually setting the time prior to the certificate expiry.\r\n\r\nI have [posted](https://issues.guix.gnu.org/44559#6) on the corresponding Guix issues about this asking about alternative solutions to this. Will keep this thread posted on relevant updates.",

With that in mind, what follows is a tentative timeline for us to switch from Gitian release builds to Guix ones for v22.0, subject to change.\r\n\r\n## Building + User Testing (~9 wks ending April 15th)\r\n### Outstanding PRs/Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] #20629 | depends: Improve id string robustness\r\n- [x] #21087 | guix: Passthrough BASE_CACHE into container \r\n- [x] #21088 | guix: Jump forwards in time-machine and adapt\r\n- [x] #21089 | guix: Add support for powerpc64{,le}\r\n- [x] #21203 | guix: gnutls-3.6.12 build failures when using `--bootstrap --no-substitutes`\r\n- [x] #21239 | guix: Add codesigning support for osx+win\r\n- [x] #21271 | guix: Explicitly set umask in build container\r\n- [x] #21272 | guix: Passthrough SDK_PATH into container\r\n- [x] #21273 | guix: Brainstorm w/re guix.sigs repo layout\r\n- [x] #21375 | guix: Misc feedback-based fixes + hier restructuring\r\n- [x] #21304 | guix: Add guix-clean script + establish gc-root for container profiles\r\n- [x] #21462 | guix: Add guix-{attest,verify} scripts\r\n\r\n### TODOs\r\n- Workflow-related\r\n\t- [x] Setting up a [`bitcoin-core/guix.sigs`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs) GitHub repository\r\n- Documentation-related\r\n\t- guix: Add installation instructions for Guix specific to Bitcoin Core builds\r\n\t*The GNU manual is too generic at times and somewhat difficult to navigate*\r\n\t- guix: Update all release documentation for new Guix process\r\n\t*`release-process.md` et al.*\r\n\r\n## Non-codesigned dress rehearsal (~2 wks ending April 29nd)\r\n\r\nAt this point, users should be able to follow `release-process.md` in order to perform Guix builds and attest to their outputs in `guix.sigs`.\r\n\r\nIn order to further improve the usability of this process, I will work with a few brave volunteers to walk through the core parts of `release-process.md`, namely:\r\n\r\n1. Installing Guix on their build machine\r\n2. Setting up a directory structure for Guix builds\r\n3. Performing a non-codesigned Guix build\r\n4. Uploading their SHA256SUMs and signatures to `guix.sigs`\r\n\r\nWhat to expect should you be brave enough to volunteer:\r\n\r\n1. I will open a direct line of communication where you can reach me for help\r\n2. I will document hiccups and open PRs to address common problems\r\n3. Depending on the performance characteristics of your build machine, whether or not you are using substitutes, and whether you request that Guix bootstraps, these builds can take up to a day or two.\r\n    I know it's fun to watch build logs scroll by 😄 , but we will most likely start the build on day `n` and check back on it on day `n+1`\r\n\r\nI would especially like to help volunteers who are not running Debian/Ubuntu, as diverse testing across distros/kernels is always a plus!\r\n\r\nPlease reach out to me if you are willing to volunteer for this.\r\n\r\n## Release dress rehearsal + refinement  (~2 wks ending May 13th)\r\n\r\nAfter we have performed user testing and ironed out usability kinks, I would like to do a dress rehearsal for the full release process.\r\n\r\nHere's how this differs from just \"user testing\":\r\n\r\n1. The commit we build will be tagged\r\n2. Codesignatures will be made and uploaded to `bitcoin-detached-sigs`\r\n3. SHA256SUMs and signatures of codesigned binaries will be uploaded to `guix.sigs`\r\n\r\nThis is to make sure that when we do the actual release for v22.0, there are no surprises.\r\n\r\n## Contingency buffer (~4+ wks ending June 15th)\r\nIf we run into any surprises (and I'm sure we will) this contingency buffer will give us some breathing room before the feature freeze.\r\n\r\n# What I need help with\r\n\r\n## High-priority\r\n\r\n- Review of outstanding PRs\r\n- Volunteers for user testing (Available sometime between March 19th and April 22nd)\r\n- Feedback on this timeline and remaining tasks outlined: am I missing anything? too optimistic?\r\n\r\n## Normal Priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Setting up a `bitcoin-core/guix.sigs` GitHub repository\r\n- [ ] Verifying that Guix debug symbol output works\r\n\r\n## Nice-to-have's\r\n\r\n- Packaging Guix v1.2.0 for your favourite distribution (please reach out if you do attempt this, I may be able to offer help!)\r\n- #21194 | guix: Make it arch agnostic\r\n",

A test of `gnutls` failed because of a chronological error whereby a certificate used in a test expired. (#21203)\r\n    - We waited until Guix v1.3.0 was released to bump our `time-machine` to a Guix with a newer version of `gnutls` that had the test fixed.\r\n2. A test of `libgit2` failed because of a chronological error whereby a test relied on relative time calculations from the present, which needed to be bumped every year (#25082)\r\n\r\n> /me shakes fist at upstream packages writing tests that depend on the current time\r\n\r\nBoth of these problems are in packages that \"underpin Guix\", which means that\r\n\r\n1. It is in the best interest of Guix (and its users) to keep testing these packages instead of turning off tests entirely\r\n2. They are not subject to the Guix package transformation flags. (`--without-tests=blah`, etc.)\r\n3. Changes to these packages will cause a mass-rebuild of almost all of Guix's packages, so these changes will be in Guix's \"core-updates\" branch for a while before hitting master (see the [Guix Manual section on Submitting Patches](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Submitting-Patches)).\r\n\r\nI think the better way might be to just maintain our own fork of Guix, that is minimally patched compared to upstream, so that we have more flexibility when deploying fixes like these and not have to wait for upstream (Guix or the actual package itself) to take our patches, go through their branching process, and hit Guix master.\r\n\r\nWhat do people think? @fanquake @hebasto @laanwj \r\n",
