    "body": "For silent payments, we want to provide a `SilentPaymentsDestination` to be used as the recipient, which requires `CRecipient` to use something other than just the `scriptPubKey` as we cannot know the output script for a silent payment prior to transaction creation. `CTxDestination` seems like the obvious place to add a `SilentPaymentsDestination` as it is our internal representation of an address.\r\n\r\nIn order to still allow paying to arbitrary scriptPubKeys (e.g. for data carrier outputs, or the user hand crafted a raw transaction that they have given to `fundrawtransaction`), `CNoDestination` is changed to contain raw scripts.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, P2PK scripts are now interpreted as a new `PubKeyDestination` rather than `PKHash`. This results in some things that would have given an address for P2PK scripts to no longer do so. This is arguably more correct.\r\n\r\n`ExtractDestination`'s behavior is slightly changed for the above. It now returns `true` for those destinations that have addresses, so P2PK scripts now result in `false`. Even though it returns false for `CNoDestination`, the script will now be included in that `CNoDestination`.\r\n\r\nBuilds on #28244",

The helper needs a few lines of code in the `src/rpc/util.h` header file. Everything else will be implemented in the cpp file once and if an RPC method needs it.",

Both a single-use scriptPubKey and a silent payments destination have a lot in common:\r\n\r\n* An amount\r\n* Instructions on where to send the money (either a `scriptPubKey` or instructions for creating `scriptPubKeys`\r\n* SFFO information\r\n\r\nMost of the steps in creating a transaction are the same, whether it's a silent payment destination or a single scriptPubKey. Therefore, a new `Destination` std::variant is introduced which can hold either a `CRecipient` or a `V0SilentPaymentDestination`, along with functions for accessing the attributes of the underlying types using a visitor pattern.\r\n\r\nThese commits are best reviewed with something like `git diff -w --color-moved=dimmed-zebra`\r\n\r\n### Silent Payments logic\r\n\r\nNext, new functions are introduced for:\r\n\r\n* Applying the Taptweak to a taproot internal private key (this is a copy-paste of the code for applying the taptweak in the signing process)\r\n* Getting a private key from a given `scriptPubKey`\r\n* Creating silent payment outputs (i.e. creating and using the `Sender` class from `wallet/silentpayments.h`\r\n* Separating a vector of `Destinations` into `CRecipient` and `V0SilentPaymentDestination` vectors\r\n\r\nEach of these functions is introduced as it's own commit. The functions are then used together to create silent payment outputs during `CreateTransactionInternal`.\r\n\r\n### Final steps\r\n\r\nThe last commits ensure that:\r\n\r\n* Coin selection is silent payments aware and knows to exclude taproot script path spends and inputs with unknown witness when funding a transaction which pays to a silent payment address\r\n* The change output type is correctly chosen when paying to a silent payment address\r\n* Functional tests\r\n",

For those outputs, script compression is not possible, as the y coordinate of the pubkey can't be recovered (see also call-site of `IsToPubKey`):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/44b05bf3fef2468783dcebf651654fdd30717e7e/src/compressor.cpp#L49-L50\r\n\r\nLikewise, for a compressed script of an uncompressed P2PK script (i.e. compression ids 4 and 5) where the x coordinate is not on the curve, decompression fails:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/44b05bf3fef2468783dcebf651654fdd30717e7e/src/compressor.cpp#L122-L129\r\n\r\nNote that the term \"compression\" is used here in two different meanings (though they are related), which might be a little confusing. The encoding of a pubkey can either be compressed (33-bytes with 0x02/0x03 prefixes) or uncompressed (65-bytes with 0x04 prefix). On the other hand there is also compression for whole output scripts, which is used for storing scriptPubKeys in the UTXO set in a compact way (and also for the `dumptxoutset` result, accordingly). P2PK output scripts with uncompressed pubkeys get compressed by storing only the x-coordinate and the sign as a prefix (0x04 = even, 0x05 = odd). Was diving deeper into the subject while working on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27432, where the script decompression of uncompressed P2PK needed special handling (see also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24628#issuecomment-1108798536).\r\n\r\nTrivia: as of now (block 801066), there are 13 uncompressed P2PK outputs in the UTXO set with a pubkey not on the curve (which obviously means they are unspendable).",

This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing.

In particular, that bitcoind will crash on startup if a reindex is requested but the `blk` files are read-only. Eventually this behavior can be updated with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27039. This PR just commits the test coverage from #27039 as suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27039#issuecomment-1584915782\r\n\r\nBecause root users on some platforms can write to read-only files, the test will expect a different outcome if run as root. To enable this, the test framework was expanded with `is_unix_root()` and the CI script modified to create a non-root user and run the functional tests as that user.",

          "body": "## For reviewers\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to make reviewing a bit more sane, I'm breaking this up into a few smaller PRs, but will keep this one open as the parent PR and keep it rebased on the child PRs. The main purpose of having this PR is to track progress on child PRs and also have an easy way to compile `bitcoind` with both send and receive support for testing. Additionally, I'll be adding more functional tests to this PR since it's much easier to test when `bitcoind` can both send and receive.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122\r\n  - Implements the logic from BIP352 without any wallet code. This PR adds the necessary cryptographic functions and implements the logic needed for sending and scanning. This PR also includes the test vectors from the BIP as unit tests. Both the send and receive PRs have this as a dependency. In terms of priority, this PR should be reviewed first\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201\r\n  - Implements sending in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to send to a silent payment address, regardless of whether or not the wallet can receive silent payments\r\n  - Ready for review, but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28202\r\n  - Implements receiving in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to generate silent payment addresses and scan for silent payments, regardless of whether or not the wallet can send to a silent payment address\r\n  - Ready for review but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n\r\nFor the silent payments specification, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458\r\n\r\n## Overall\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the full silent payments scheme: sending and receiving. The following items are not covered in this PR and are intended for follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n* Adding labels for the receiver wallet\r\n* Full RPC coverage (only `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` are covered in this PR)\r\n* Light client support (vending the tweak data per block, either in an index or to serve to indexer, such as electrum server)\r\n* Add benchmarks to validate that there are no DoS concerns for doing silent payment verification for transactions in the mempool\r\n* External signer support (dependent on hardware wallets supporting silent payments)\r\n* More unit / functional test coverage\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24897. Below is a summary of the major changes:\r\n\r\n* Remove labels\r\n  * The original draft included labels, but this has been deferred for a later PR. Labels are not necessary for sending and receiving and there are still some open questions on how best to implement them in Bitcoin Core. Labels can also be added at any point by the receiver without requiring any changes from the sender\r\n* Remove indexes\r\n  * In the original draft, indexes were used when scanning for silent payments and when doing wallet rescans. This has been removed in favor of using `rev*.dat` files for rescanning. It may make sense to add an index in the future, but for the purpose of vending tweak data to light clients, which is still an open question\r\n* Update to implement the most current version of BIP352\r\n  * Since the original draft, there have been a few changes in the BIP which are reflected in the current PR. Most notably, using 33-byte compressed keys for the silent payment address (as opposed to X-only keys in the original draft) \r\n\r\nIt may be helpful for context to read through the discussions on #24897 , but ongoing review should happen in the relevant child PRs listed above.",

For instance, within the bumpfee functionality, we\r\nmanually extract the change recipient from the transaction before calling\r\n'CreateTransaction' to ensure that the change output is not duplicated.\r\n\r\nSide note:\r\nThis is something that will be using for the #26732 rework.",
