    "body": "To supplement the [ongoing conceptual discussion about a testnet reset](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/9bL00vRj7OU/m/9yCPo3uUBwAJ) I have drafted a move to v4 including a fix to the difficulty adjustment mechanism, which was part of the motivation that started the discussion.\r\n\r\nConceptual considerations:\r\n- The conceptual discussion about doing a testnet4 or softforking the fix into testnet3 is outside of the scope of this PR and I would ask reviewers to contribute their opinions on this on the ML instead. However, I am happy to adapt this PR to a softfork change on testnet3 if there is consensus for that instead.\r\n- The difficulty adjustment fix suggested here touches the `CalculateNextWorkRequired` function and uses the same logic used in `GetNextWorkRequired` to find the last previous block that was not mined with difficulty 1 under the exceptionf. An alternative fix briefly mentioned on the mailing list by Jameson Lopp would be to \"restrict the special testnet minimum difficulty rule so that it can't be triggered on the block right before a difficulty retarget\". That would also fix the issue but I find my suggestion here a bit more elegant.",

          "title": "Stratum v2 Template Provider (take 3)",
          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. Compared to #28983 it introduces EllSwift in the handshake and fixes various bugs. I used that opportunity to change the branch name, which makes testing against [SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) slightly easier. There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #26812\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

I can unrebase and pick the test if that PR doesn't make it.\r\n\r\n---\r\nEarlier description, just historical context now.\r\n\r\n**Sigops**\r\n\r\nTwo recent F2Pool blocks violated the sigops limit. Both by 3.\r\n\r\nI suspect they were not using `getblocktemplate`. If you look at the [template](https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/00000000000000000004e0ec4f27bd3347381e8e19ed98d7f918e8c1c292ae97) right before the valid block at the same height, which was produced two minutes later, you'll see that it matches the block with 3 small transactions difference. In other words, the valid block producer likely did use `getblocktemplate` around the same time and did not experience an issue.\r\n\r\nIt's also clear by looking at [Mempool.Space](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000004e0ec4f27bd3347381e8e19ed98d7f918e8c1c292ae97) that the valid block excluded many large bare multisig transactions. Those transactions paid more than enough in fees to be included, but we would have excluded them due to running out of sigops.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in `BlockAssembler::addPackageTxs` and `TestPackage` we simply don't add a package to the block if it doesn't fit the remaining weight or sigops. Custom block construction software might not do that. I initially though they might have forgotten to check SegWit related sigops, but that seems unlikely given that they were only off by 3 in both blocks.\r\n\r\nI suspect their mistake was to not count the number of sigops in the coinbase: it pays to legacy P2PKH which uses 4 sigops. Our code reserves 400 sigops for the coinbase, so would not have caused this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n_Update 2024-01-09: I dropped the extra debug fields mentioned here_\r\n\r\nAnyway, while checking our code I added a few extra fields to the block statistics of~ `getblocktemplate`:\r\n\r\n* `sigops`: total sigops for the block excluding the coinbase\r\n* `coinbase_reserved_sigops`: how many sigops we reserve for the coinbase (400)\r\n* `weightlimit`\r\n* `coinbase_reserved_weight`\r\n\r\n~I added a belt and suspenders check for the sigops limit in the RPC code.~ (_update 2024-01-09: dropped_) Note that we already check it when adding packages to a block _and_ in `TestBlockValidity`.\r\n\r\n**Segwit**\r\n\r\n~I also removed the need to set `{\"rules\": \"!segwit\"}`, the generation of pre-segwit blocks, and the test code that checks activation.~ _update 2023-08-18: commit removed_",

      "body": "When resetting a test chain, it is also important to consider the script interpreter coverage of the current chain. Test chains are (usually) the first place to go to, to test new script primitives and protocols, as well as consensus deployments. The existing chain thus serves as a test for consensus implementations, apart from basic unit test vectors. It would be good to think how to preserve the test vectors in the chain. See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11739#issuecomment-346515145 . Or if it is not needed, it would be good to say so. Maybe https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/blob/main/unit_test_data/script_assets_test.json already covers a good portion?\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, testnet is the only public chain where anyone can submit a nonstandard transaction from their laptop. Recall that policy is enforced on all networks equally (see commit e1dc15d69061e69351c72907444e8ded0ac7c88c), so getting a non-mempool transaction into a block is only possible for a miner, or by cooperating with a miner. So if the difficulty hack is removed completely, anyone wishing to submit a transaction would have to go purchase and set up mining hardware, or find a miner willing to accept the transaction. Not saying what is the best approach here, just saying that the effects should be considered and a change be done intentionally.",

I am experimenting with some of the proposals from the mailing list and so I added Andres Poelstra's suggested difficulty adjustment with 6h/1M from here: https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/9bL00vRj7OU/m/kFPaQCzmBwAJ\r\n\r\n> Probably we should support tracking both testnet3 and the new testnet4 for some time. Making the new code conditional on a different chain param that's only set for testnet4 would probably be the easiest way of accomplishing that?\r\n\r\nUpdated the code to introduce T4 (`-testnet4`) and keep T3 in place but give some deprecation warning when it's used. I guess we would keep this in place for 1 or 2 releases and then remove T3 and then let `-testnet` run T4.\r\n\r\nI am using the Genesis block hash to distinguish between the two testnets. There may be cleaner solutions but I think this is ok since it would be only temporary until T3 is removed.\r\n\r\n> Moreover, testnet is the only public chain where anyone can submit a nonstandard transaction from their laptop.\r\n\r\nIs it really realistic that someone with just their CPU would be able to mine a block with their non-standard tx on the current testnet? If the bug isn't active currently they would need to wait for it to become active and that could take weeks, right? And when it becomes active I would imagine the miner who found the first block in the difficulty=1 series just blasts the network and the CPU miner still has no chance to get a block in between. \r\n\r\nWe could revert #28354 for testnet4 if this is a feature that matters to users. Is it too much to ask that people use `testmempoolaccept` or run their own testnet node with `-acceptnonstdtxn=0` when they want to test standardness of their tx? I would say no. And I don't see another option to solve this on layer 1 if we assume nobody changes the defaults.\r\n\r\n> It would be good to think how to preserve the test vectors in the chain.\r\n\r\nInteresting thought. I think once there is consensus to do T4 we will find a creative solution for this. Cool would be to convert this coverage to fuzzing coverage somehow but I am not sure if that's realistic or worth the effort. Otherwise, we could write a program that looks at all the different scripts that exist on T3 and replays them on T4 or if we can compress them somehow like by filtering everything that doesn't add coverage, then we turn it into a unit test that replays the interesting scripts.",

      "body": "Since some people consider the blockstorms an interesting feature of Testnet3, it might be interesting to only raise the difficulty of the delayed block exception to 100,000 instead of 1,000,000. This would allow the network to return to the organic difficulty in fewer difficulty periods and slow down the blockstorms but not remove the feature altogether. My understanding is that this would correspond roughly a tenth of one S9 mining on the network, so if no one had mined for a while, a single S9 could restart the network with ~60 s blocks, but wouldn’t churn out thousands of blocks per second.\r\n\r\nOnly allowing lower difficulty blocks after 6 hours could easily make testnet useless for extended periods, if someone put several ASICs on testnet for a while, it might prevent other users from getting confirmations for up to 6 hours. I could see an increase from the twenty minute rule to maybe an hour, but more seems counter to why the rule was introduced in the first place.",

      "body": "> Is it really realistic that someone with just their CPU would be able to mine a block\r\n\r\nYes, I am not sure what would be the problem. All you have to do is to set the time +20min and mine a block on your laptop. If you don't want to try it yourself, you can come by to watch it on my laptop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Since some people consider the blockstorms an interesting feature of Testnet3\r\n\r\nAfter a quick chat with @murchandamus, an alternative fix would be to require the pre-retarget block to have the \"correct\" difficulty, so that all retarget periods are organic. The +20min hack would remain to allow a CPU to mine a few blocks, if needed, however, a block storm would be naturally limited by the +120h cut-off rule. This would limit the block storms to small block \"gusts\", which seems good enough to make everyone happy?",

I'd think 3 hours would suffice, since it would mean that at worst someone would be able to generate a block 1 hour after the previous block if they also warped the time ahead by the max 2 hours.\r\n\r\nThree hours seems too long to me. That would mean that the first use of the low-difficulty loophole would require one hour of wait (by also setting your clock two hours to the future), but any subsequent block would be delayed by three hours. It would be trivial for anyone with a modicum of hashpower to disrupt liveness of testnet for any hashpowerless developers.\r\n\r\nConsidering @jlopp’s demonstration of the downsides of the low-difficulty loophole, and mulling it over a bit more, I would now prefer:\r\n\r\n1. Retain the 20-minute difficulty exception\r\nThis would permit developers to author a new block with at most reasonable delay. While nobody else is doing so, it would be possible to author a new block almost immediately, if someone is already making use of the exception, a wait of twenty minutes would be sufficient to allow another block.\r\n2. Prevent use of the 20-minute difficulty exception on the last block in a difficulty period\r\nThis would mitigate the blockstorms to only short block gusts: if no one else is making use of the exception, a user would be able to issue around six blocks almost instantaneously, but no more.\r\n3. Do not increase the minimum difficulty\r\nRestricting authoring of new block to owners of ASIC equipment just seems unnecessary, if the difficulty reset to minimum difficulty is mitigated.\r\n\r\nObviously, the testnet would still be vulnerable to the [timewarp bug](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/75831/5406), so perhaps testnet4 should include a variant of the proposed rule from the Great Consensus Cleanup that would require the first block of a difficulty period to be no more than two hours less than the previous difficulty period’s last block’s timestamp.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I would be satisfied if using the 20-minute difficulty exception would be changed such that `nBits` could remain at the proper value, and were available for any block in the difficulty period without incurring the difficulty resetting to the minimum. However, my understanding is that the difficulty check in block validation is context independent, and therefore a block would fail if the hash were higher than the `nBits` value in its own header.",

      "body": "I had to rebase to fix a silent merge conflict and I think I managed to make the CI happy with the tests I added. In general, I think this can be moved out of draft status now since we are discussing the details of the changes in parameters but overall there seems to be no opposition to the change. I initially had removed Testnet3 as part of this already and keeping it in place makes this much less controversial/dangerous.\r\n\r\nI have removed the adjustments on min difficulty and changed the exception period back to 20 min. I think keeping this as is seems to be the path that has the most support but if there is consensus on a mild adjustment of the exception period of course I can add this again. Given what was discussed maybe we can agree on 30 min or 1 h but if it's unclear that this is really needed we should probably not change too many things at once.\r\n\r\n> I'd propose the following coinbase string referencing an article published today regarding testnet: \"CCN 02/May/2024 Bitcoin Testnet Could Need Reset\"\r\n\r\nHappy to add this, I considered my genesis block just a placeholder anyway. The only reason we might use something different is if review here drags on for a few months and people would prefer something fresher by then. I will add it in my next push unless other reviewers disagree with the choice.\r\n\r\n> Prevent use of the 20-minute difficulty exception on the last block in a difficulty period\r\n\r\n@murchandamus do you explicitly prefer this over my proposed fix? I find it more elegant and intuitive if we allow the use on all blocks and prevent the adjustment from being affected by it.\r\n\r\n> perhaps testnet4 should include a variant of the proposed rule from the Great Consensus Cleanup that would require the first block of a difficulty period to be no more than two hours less than the previous difficulty period’s last block’s timestamp.\r\n\r\nInteresting, I will try to see how easy it would be to do this.\r\n\r\n> Alternatively, I would be satisfied if using the 20-minute difficulty exception would be changed such that nBits could remain at the proper value, and were available for any block in the difficulty period without incurring the difficulty resetting to the minimum. However, my understanding is that the difficulty check in block validation is context independent, and therefore a block would fail if the hash were higher than the nBits value in its own header.\r\n\r\nI am not sure I understand this: you are talking about the fix I have proposed here, right? If that is so, I am not sure I understand why the header would diverge from the block on the nBits though. ",

      "body": "> Prevent use of the 20-minute difficulty exception on the last block in a difficulty period\r\n\r\nI think the worst case here is that someone with significant hashpower quickly mines a few retarget periods to get the difficulty to increase a lot, then stops mining, and no one else is around with enough hashpower who's willing to mine a block.\r\n\r\nWith the rule above, that means we could get to the end of the period, but would then stall, as the last block would be expensive. With the rule in the PR we have, we'd instead probably get a full retarget period of min difficulty blocks, and then drop to min difficulty and still have a block storm.\r\n\r\nWould it maybe be feasible to require min difficulty blocks to record the real difficulty in the nVersion field, and use that to calculate the expected difficulty for the next retarget period directly without having to search for a non-min-difficulty header? I think that wouldn't even conflict with versionbits signalling (though min difficulty blocks would not be able to signal for activation, but that seems fine).",
