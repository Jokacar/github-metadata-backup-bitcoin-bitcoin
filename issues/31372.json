Bitcoin Core is probably already running.\r\n2024-11-25T21:18:29Z [error] Failed to listen on any port. Use -listen=0 if you want this.\r\nError: Failed to listen on any port. Use -listen=0 if you want this.\r\n```\r\n\r\n(because I already have one listening)\r\n\r\nThis was not the case in 0.27. I noticed when upgrading `nixpkgs` in our test suite (which switches bitcoind from 0.27 to 0.28). We used to set `port` and `rpcport` in the config and that was it. Now we need to set also `bind` and `rpcbind`.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nUnclear if this is a bug, but clearly a change in the behavior, so worth reporting.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```\r\nbitcoind --datadir=(mktemp -d) -port=51234 -rpcport=51235\r\n```\r\n\r\n, check ports with `sudo netstat -l -p -n | grep bitcoind`\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPackage manager\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv28.0.0\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nNixOS 24.11-beta\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
