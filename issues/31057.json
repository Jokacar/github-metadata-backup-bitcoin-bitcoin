    "title": "Disallow building fuzz binary without `-DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING`",
    "body": "Without `-DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING` the fuzz binary is less suited for testing puporses, because it won't crash on `Assume` and it won't work around fuzz blockers with `FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION`. Afaict, the only place where the fuzz binary is currently used without `-DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING` is in the macOS and windows CI jobs.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose that we split the CI jobs into separate fuzz-only jobs that use `-DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING` and that we remove support for building the fuzz binary without it.\r\n\r\nHistorically, we used to build most binaries by default (including the fuzz binary) to ensure that compile failures are caught early by devs. With the switch to CMake this is no longer the case and imo that's fine since compile failures would be caught by the CI or other devs that regularly fuzz.\r\n\r\nThis would also avoid the need for workarounds like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31028.",
