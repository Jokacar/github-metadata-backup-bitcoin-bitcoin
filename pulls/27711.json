    "body": "This pull request is part of the `libbitcoinkernel` project https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587 https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/projects/3 and more specifically its \"Step 2: Decouple most non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel\".\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis removes the shutdown files from the kernel library. As a standalone library the libbitcoinkernel should not have to rely on code that accesses shutdown state through a global. Instead, replace it with an interrupt class that is owned by the kernel context. Additionally this moves the remaining usages of the `uiInterface` out of the kernel code. The process of moving the `uiInterface` out of the kernel was started in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken here uses the notification interface to externalize the existing shutdown code from the kernel library. The `SignalInterrupt` kernel context member is passed by reference to the `ChainstateManager` to allow for the termination of long-running kernel functions and sending interrupt signals.\r\n",

          "body": "The current procedure for building the block filter index involves processing filters one at a time;\r\nReading blocks, undo data, and previous headers from disk sequentially.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new mechanism that employs concurrent processing. Dividing the\r\nfilters generation workload among a pool of workers that can be configured by the user,\r\nsignificantly increasing the speed of the index construction process.\r\n\r\nThe same concurrent processing model has been applied to the transactions index as well.\r\n\r\nThe newly introduced init flag `-indexworkers=<n>` enables the concurrent sync\r\nbehavior.\r\nWhere \"n\" is the number of worker threads that will be spawned at startup to create ranges\r\nof block filters during the initial sync process. Destroying the workers pool once the\r\ninitial sync completes.\r\nNote: by default, the parallelized sync process is not enabled.\r\n\r\nNow the juicy part:\r\nIn my computer, with the node in debug mode and on IBD, with `-indexworkers=4`, the\r\nblock filter index generation took less than an hour. While, in master, the sync took more than 7 hours.\r\n\r\nImportant Note:\r\nAs the access to the block data on disk is protected by `cs_main`, this new feature runs substantially\r\nfaster when the node is not in IBD.\r\n\r\nFootnote:\r\nThis is part of a larger project :).",

          "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #10102 + #19460.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`5f91aa3d8b47` multiprocess: Add bitcoin-gui -ipcconnect option](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461/commits/5f91aa3d8b47cee97e625c3b5689a37dbd941eff)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBuilding on #10102, this adds an `-ipcconnect` option to `bitcoin-gui` that connects the GUI to an existing `bitcoin-node` process already running in the background instead of spawning a new `bitcoin-node` process. This allows the GUI to be started and stopped independently of the node. By default with this change, `bitcoin-gui` will check if a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` socket exists and try to connect to that. If that doesn't work, it will spawn a new node process and start up the same way it did before this PR.\r\n\r\nThe default `bitcoin-gui` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which tries to connect if possible as described above, and spawns a new `bitcoin-node` process if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to never connect to an existing node and always spawn a new one, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, basic functionality works and gui instances can connect and disconnect from a running node. But there are rough edges: If a gui process doesn't shut down cleanly, the node can see unhandled IpcExceptions, and if node command line options are passed to `bitcoin-gui` and `bitcoin-gui` connects to an exiting bitcoin-node process instead of spawning a new one, the node options will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)",

          "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #10102.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`bbefbd3c199b` multiprocess: Add -ipcconnect and -ipcbind options](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19460/commits/bbefbd3c199b189188d6427b4564b17477c6d50e)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBuilding on #10102, this adds an `-ipcconnect` option to `bitcoin-wallet` and an `-ipcbind` option to `bitcoin-node` (both enabled by default in multiprocess builds) so bitcoin node will listen on a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` unix socket, and `bitcoin-wallet` will connect to it.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that `bitcoin-wallet` can be extended in the future to have some online functionality. For example, there could be a `bitcoin-wallet sync` command that will update balances and sync latest transactions to an unloaded wallet, or a `bitcoin-wallet serve` subcommand that loads a wallet and serves RPC requests, or a `bitcoin-wallet shell` subcommand that allows running RPC methods interactively like the GUI console, or just general support for `bitcoin-wallet <rpc method> <rpc params>` invocations suggested https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13926#issuecomment-455187379.\r\n\r\nThis PR is small and doesn't do much. The only visible change is that `bitcoin-wallet` now checks whether a node socket exists on startup and prints \"Connected to IPC address\" if it can connect it it.\r\n\r\nThe default `bitcoin-wallet` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which connects if possible as described above, and proceeds offline if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to disable ipc, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\r\n\r\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)\r\n",

          "body": "- Background and FAQ: https://github.com/jamesob/assumeutxo-docs/tree/2019-04-proposal/proposal\r\n- Prior progress/project: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/11\r\n- Replaces https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606, which was closed due to Github slowness. Original description and commentary can be found there.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis changeset finishes the first phase of the assumeutxo project. It makes UTXO snapshots loadable via RPC (`loadtxoutset`) and adds `assumeutxo` parameters to chainparams. It contains all the remaining changes necessary to both use an assumedvalid snapshot chainstate and do a full validation sync in the background.\r\n\r\nThis may look like a lot to review, but note that\r\n- 200 lines are duplicated in #24008 \r\n- ~200 lines are a (non-essential) demo shell script\r\n- Many lines are functional test, documentation, and relatively dilute RPC code.\r\n\r\nSo it shouldn't be as burdensome to review as the linecount might suggest.\r\n\r\n- **P2P**: minor changes are made to `init.cpp` and `net_processing.cpp` to make simultaneous IBD across multiple chainstates work.\r\n- **Pruning**: implement correct pruning behavior when using a background chainstate\r\n- **Blockfile separation**: to prevent \"fragmentation\" in blockfile storage, have background chainstates use separate blockfiles from active snapshot chainstates to avoid interleaving heights and impairing pruning.\r\n- **Indexing**: all existing `CValidationInterface` events are given with an additional parameter, ChainstateRole, and all indexers ignore events from ChainstateRole::ASSUMEDVALID so that indexation only happens sequentially.\r\n- Raise error when both `-reindex` and assumeutxo are in use.\r\n- **RPC**: introduce RPC commands `loadtxoutset` and (hidden) `getchainstates`.\r\n- **Release docs & first assumeutxo commitment**: add notes and a particular assumeutxo hash value for first AU-enabled release.\r\n  - This will complete the project and allow use of UTXO snapshots for faster node bootstrap.\r\n\r\nThe next phase, if it were to be pursued, would be coming up with a way to distribute the UTXO snapshots over the P2P network.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### UTXO snapshots\r\n\r\n- **788'000**\r\n  - HTTP: http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat\r\n  - Torrent: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:a457a54c76dfdbb3f44e3485a84c4772bea647e0&dn=utxo-788000.dat&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl%3A6969`\r\n  - Create your own with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh`\r\n    - e.g. `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh 788000 utxo.dat ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$(pwd)/testdata`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### For fun (~5min)\r\n\r\nIf you want to do a quick test, you can run `./contrib/devtools/test_utxo_snapshots.sh` and follow the instructions. This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob assumeutxo\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/assumeutxo\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.",

The following pull requests prepared `util/system` for this final step: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27419 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27254 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27238.\r\n\r\n`interface_ui` defines functions for a more general node interface and has a dependency on `boost/signals2`. After applying the patches from this pull request, the kernel's reliance on boost is down to `boost::multiindex`.\r\n\r\nThe approach implemented here introduces some indirection, which makes the code a bit harder to read. Any suggestions for improving or reworking this pull request to make it more concise, or even reworking it into a more proper interface, are appreciated.",

          "body": "This PR proposes a clean up of the relationship between block storage and the chainstate objects, by moving the decision of whether to store a block on disk to something that is not chainstate-specific.  Philosophically, the decision of whether to store a block on disk is related to validation rules that do not require any UTXO state; for anti-DoS reasons we were using some chainstate-specific heuristics, and those have been reworked here to achieve the proposed separation.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a bug in how a chainstate's `setBlockIndexCandidates` was being initialized; it should always have all the HAVE_DATA block index entries that have more work than the chain tip.  During startup, we were not fully populating `setBlockIndexCandidates` in some scenarios involving multiple chainstates.\r\n\r\nFurther, this PR establishes a concept that whenever we have 2 chainstates, that we always know the snapshotted chain's base block and the base block's hash must be an element of our block index. Given that, we can establish a new invariant that the background validation chainstate only needs to consider blocks leading to that snapshotted block entry as potential candidates for its tip. As a followup I would imagine that when writing net_processing logic to download blocks for the background chainstate, that we would use this concept to only download blocks towards the snapshotted entry as well.",

      "body": "I spent some time reviving my clang-tidy transform plugin which is able to force bubble-ups of fatal errors and decorations of functions which may call them. I'm not suggesting that we use this approach (I mentioned at core-dev that it works but I find it pretty ugly), though it's useful to point out our current shutdown behavior.\r\n\r\nNote that the plugin is self-written, so it's not flawless. It does produce compiling code though, so I have a reasonable amount of confidence.\r\n\r\n[See here for the transform of the current master branch](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/8054f8b204ae30c781768133da7e2b308e5b7ad1).\r\n\r\nA quick guide:\r\n- Any functions/assignments/declarations which may call shutdown is wrapped in a macro like `MAYBE_EXIT`, `EXIT_OR_IF`, etc.\r\n- Any function containing one of those gets a return type of ``MaybeEarlyExit<real_return_type>`` in order to bubble it up the call-stack.\r\n- This repeats recursively until the topmost functions have had their return type modified.\r\n\r\nThis provides an easy way to see whether or not a high-level function may call shutdown from some deeply nested function.\r\n\r\nIt also provides an easy way to see when calls to shutdown are made _without_ returning to the calling function.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked at the actual result yet at all. I suspect it will [point out several things for us to fix](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1200547867).",

Am I correct when guessing that any added EXIT* macro, and not the BUBBLE* macros are indicating a missing return?\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke Right, the `BUBBLE_UP` is kinda like a cast, it's not so interesting. The others introduce conditional returns to pass any errors back up the stack. So the problem cases are ones where we don't already have that behavior.\r\n\r\nThe main complication comes from the fact that the callstack might look like:\r\n```\r\nvoid foo()\r\n  int bar()\r\n    std::string baz()\r\n```\r\nWhere `baz()` returns a fatal error. The solution implemented here is to wrap everything in a variant:\r\n```\r\nMaybeEarlyExit<void> foo()\r\n  MaybeEarlyExit<int> bar()\r\n    MaybeEarlyExit<std::string> baz()\r\n```\r\nWhere: `MaybeEarlyExit : std::variant<T, FatalError, UserInterrupted>` (and those are simple enum classes)\r\n\r\nSo basically if the call resulted in an error, pass an error type back up immediately rather than a real return value. These [macros are defined here](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/1fb1e7c632ccf5cd9e8a64cccfa490c688e3dbaa) and do that as necessary (you can largely think of them of different notations of try/catch/rethrow). In fact, this model forces that invariant: you get a return value or a fatal error but never both.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[BlockManager::WriteUndoDataForBlock](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/8054f8b204ae30c781768133da7e2b308e5b7ad1#diff-114c2880ec1ff2c5293ac65ceda0637bf92c05745b74b58410585a549464a33fL718) is a good example of correct/incorrect:\r\n- FindUndoPos: potential error caught and passed back up (what callers do with it is a different question)\r\n- UndoWriteToDisk: aborts and returns immediately as needed\r\n- [FlushUndoFile](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/8054f8b204ae30c781768133da7e2b308e5b7ad1#diff-114c2880ec1ff2c5293ac65ceda0637bf92c05745b74b58410585a549464a33fR738): this one is (I believe) an example of a missed return in master that could cause problems with changes like these. Not necessarily this one in particular, but it's clearly not alone. Edit: to be clear, the problem here is that `FlushUndoFile` may call `AbortNode`, but we don't react to that in `WriteUndoDataForBlock`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to proceed. @ryanofsky mentioned maybe fixing them up as part of this shutdown callback effort?",

The fatal errors there seem different than other fatal errors, and the contradict the \"whatever function triggered the error should also return an error code or raise an exception\" documention.\r\n\r\nI would suggest making one (or both) of the following changes to this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Changing `FlushBlockFile` and `FlushUndoFile` to send a different \"flush failed\" notification rather than \"fatal error\". The node's KernelNotifications handler could treat this just like a fatal error to keep current behavior the same. Other applications using libbitcoinkernel might choose to handle the error in a different way for example by sending a notification or trying to free up disk space, rather than shutting down the service right away.\r\n2. Changing `FlushBlockFile` and `FlushUndoFile` to return `[[nodiscard]] bool`, and changing calls to these functions either bubble up the error or have comments about why the error is safe to ignore in that particular context.",

[You can see an example of it here ](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/blob/clang-tidy-shutdown-rebase/src/early_exit.h#L45)to force bubble-up warnings.\r\n\r\nRather than returning `bool`, maybe return a custom `[[nodiscard]]` result type? That way if the caller wants to bubble-up the result, the use-checking bubbles up as well. Of course that starts breaking down as soon as something actually needs its return value, so maybe it's not useful. Just throwing it out there because imo it's neat :)",

Instead of adding multiple functions, it feels like a better approach here might be to encode some common error reasons into an enum and let the user then decide how to handle them.  I don't understand why these abort calls were ignored so far (the code was introduced [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ac94141af0c16161afa68de1c3720f254ae4e12c)).",

      "body": "> Is there really a qualitative difference between the errors?\r\n\r\nI didn't dig into the actual errors, but the qualitative difference here seems to be that the other AbortNode errors actually need to be fatal and should try to shut down to prevent getting into a worse state. But an error flushing state in memory to disk does not need to be fatal, as long the state in memory is kept and can be saved later. There are lots of ways an application could handle a failed flush notification, and I think it would be better to avoid using fatal error callback for any notification that does not have to be fatal.\r\n\r\nThe choice of whether to use separate methods or enums is basically just aesthetic. And I didn't dig into whether these particular flush errors need to fatal or not. I think you can decide what to do here or whether to do anything at all. My reason for suggesting \"flushFailed\" as an alternative to \"nodiscard bool\" was that latter change might be more invasive and require changing more sensitive code.",

Fixed by first opening for read, then for write.\r\n* We need to restore the previous state after perturbations, so that only the current perturbation is active and not a mix of the current and previous ones.\r\n* I also added `checkblocks=200` to the startup parameters so that corruption in earlier blocks of `blk00000.dat` is detected during init verification and not ignored.\r\n\r\nAfter fixing `feature_init.py` like that I'd run into the `assert` mentioned above (so running the testfix from the second commit without the first one is a way to reproduce it).",

      "body": "Thank you @theuni and @ryanofsky for the great discussion so far.\r\n\r\nUpdated a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5 -> f13880e83200ec824d7528061f96708d96bf9bd4 ([rmKernelShutdown_0](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commits/rmKernelShutdown_0) -> [rmKernelShutdown_1](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commits/rmKernelShutdown_1), [compare](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/compare/rmKernelShutdown_0..rmKernelShutdown_1)).\r\n\r\nThis update reworks the existing logic in this pull request by integrating @ryanofsky's suggested [branch](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/review.27711.1-edit). \r\n\r\nInstead of getting rid of the shutdown logic in the kernel, the core logic is now retained, but de-globalized and wrapped into a more user-friendly and self-descriptive class (`SignalInterrupt`).\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to @ryanofsky's [suggestion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27711#discussion_r1214568318) for dropping the commits handling `startShutdown` I added boolean options that can be set by users of the kernel to indicate whether it should terminate if either a `FatalError` or `Interrupt` should trigger an actual interrupt.\r\n\r\nAlso adds two new commits, one for making a failure connecting the best block a `FatalError` and another for making `FlushBlockFile` and `FlushUndoFile` return on calls to `FatalError`. Rationale for each of these is provided in the commit messages.\r\n\r\nThese patches now went through quite some evolution in terms of their scope and intention. I am pushing this patch set to show how I'd currently unify the feeback received so far. In terms of next steps I'd like to lay out the following options:\r\n\r\n1. Get the current patch set through review, completing the goal of removing the `ui_interface` and some of the boost headers from the kernel. Complete step 2 of this phase of the kernel project. Add another step in this phase of the kernel project for strictly typing any functions that may cause an interrupt. My current thinking is to use @ryanofsky's #25665 extension of the `Result` type to return either a result or these fatal errors. Each instance of an interrupt call will be replaced piecemeal in separate PR's to allow for clean review. I found that some of these cases get quite complicated, meaning simply returning on a fatal error may lead to bugs if surrounding code is not also adapted, and catching all nuances in a single, sprawling PR is probably too burdensome. Eventually this should lead to code where we'd only have to trigger a fatal interrupt at the edges of the library, and otherwise just push fatal errors to code using it. \r\n\r\n2. Revert to a more minimal patch set, basically containing the new interrupt class + the `FatalError` wrapper to remove the `ui_interface`. Then proceed as in step 1.\r\n\r\n3. Close this PR, then proceed as in step 1. Once all fatal interrupt cases are handled, circle back to the kernel interrupt handling for long-running functions and conditional interrupts (in other words those lines of code that currently call `StartShutdown`).\r\n\r\nOption 1 is what seems pragmatic to me currently, option 2 would be closest to the goals as laid out in the kernel tracking issue (first cleave unwanted functionality / dependencies, then improve interfaces and fix weirdness discovered during development). Option 3 is where my heart is, even if it might block progress for some time and would depend on a bunch of other improvements to be completed first.",

      "body": "Thanks for following up and incorporating the feedback! \r\n\r\nOn the topic of how to move forward with these changes, I think we should see if we can find a way to avoid making temporary changes to validation code that are not desirable for the long term. Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Having `interrupt_on_fatal_error` and `interrupt_on_condition` ChainStateManager options which are complicated (and very confusing even to me!)\r\n- Giving ChainStateManager a mutable reference to the interrupt object instead of a const reference, and using the mutable reference to have it send interrupt signals to itself.\r\n\r\nIf temporary kludges are necessary to avoid having a PR that is too big to review, maybe that's a good tradeoff. But it would be better if we could see what the final code looks like before making that tradeoff. If this isn't possible, I think we should at least be able to add comments / documentation in the code saying which things are temporary and how they should be used in the meantime.\r\n\r\nIf you want to take time to iterate more on this code more, I think we could easily pull out parts of this PR right now that are pure improvements and could be reviewed and merged quickly. If you took the first commit here 8b3ac7d95253ac9c17faee3df29f11144e79f8b4 and the last two commits a4034e719c0dfa07bc8c267af3c2139d3b353757\r\nand bbfbcd0360e486d47025a412f2c0f4e8535ab255 that were previously part of #27636, I think we could quickly review and merge these in a separate PR as they are pure refactorings which do not change behavior or add temporary kludges to validation code.\r\n\r\nAfter that PR or alongside it commits 60f5461e160c4ef9aa5ee8e34f70a6459d12cae5 and 79b549abee60d13edcf8fe6a4c899c1b0bd08f88 from this PR also seem like good candidates for splitting off and being in their own PR so they could get more careful review as they do change behavior subtly.\r\n\r\nGreat to see more work here, though. I think there are still some tricky details to work out but most of the changes seem very good.",

This PR also drops the last reference to the `uiInterface` global in kernel code. The process of moving the `uiInterface` out of the kernel was started in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636.\r\n\r\nThis pull request contains a subset of patches originally proposed in #27711. It will be part of a series of changes required to make handling of interrupts (or in other words the current shutdown procedure) in the kernel library more transparent and less reliable on global mutable state. The set of patches contained here was originally proposed by @ryanofsky [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27711#issuecomment-1580779869). ",

          "title": "blockstorage: Return on fatal flush errors",
          "body": "The goal of this PR is to establish that fatal blockstorage flush errors should be treated as errors at their call site.\r\n\r\nPrior to this patch `FlushBlockFile` may have failed without returning in `Chainstate::FlushStateToDisk`, leading to a potential write from `WriteBlockIndexDB` that may refer to a block that is not fully flushed to disk yet. By returning if either `FlushUndoFile` or `FlushBlockFile` fail, we ensure that no further write operations take place that may lead to an inconsistent database when crashing. Add `[[nodiscard]]` annotations to them such that they are not ignored in future.\r\n\r\nFunctions that call either `FlushUndoFile` or `FlushBlockFile`, need to handle these extra abort cases properly. Since `Chainstate::FlushStateToDisk` already produces an abort error in case of `WriteBlockIndexDB` failing, no extra logic for functions calling `Chainstate::FlushStateToDisk` is required.\r\n\r\nBesides `Chainstate::FlushStateToDisk`, `FlushBlockFile` is also called by `FindBlockPos`, while `FlushUndoFile` is only called by `FlushBlockFile` and `WriteUndoDataForBlock`. For both these cases, the flush error is not further bubbled up. Instead, the error is logged and a comment is provided why bubbling up an error would be less desirable in these cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis pull request is part of a larger effort towards improving the shutdown / abort / fatal error handling in validation code. It is a first step towards implementing proper fatal error return type enforcement similar as proposed by theuni in this pull request [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27711#issuecomment-1563561502). For ease of review of these critical changes, a first step would be checking that `AbortNode` leads to early and error-conveying returns at its call site. Further work for enforcing returns when `AbortNode` is called is done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27862.",

I don't see why such logic should exist in a standalone kernel library. Do you have a different perspective here?\r\n\r\nYes, I don't think we should do this because it gets in the way of the kernel having a nice and future-proof API.\r\n\r\nI think we both agree that applications using libbitcoinkernel should have a way to cancel long running kernel threads and operations from an outside thread or signal handler. My [branch](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/review.27711.1-edit) provides that functionality though a [`SignalInterrupt`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/cf326d0a42eadff811d466a84cbdd626f39c9d86/src/kernel/context.h#L21-L22) object that sits in the `kernel::Context` struct. By contrast, the [current PR](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commits/a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5) uses a `std::atomic<bool>` object that application needs to initialize itself and pass to the library.\r\n\r\nI think the approach in the branch is better for two reasons:\r\n\r\n- Using an `SignalInterrupt` object instead of an atomic bool provides a more future-proof API. It is true that right now, all the code running in the kernel can just get away with polling a bool every once in a while to decide whether to continue executing. But we don't know that this will be true in the future. If future kernel code wants to use a thread pool or some other asynchronous processing, there should be a way for outside code to _actively_ send an interrupt and cancel that processing, not just passively set a bool and require the kernel to poll for it. Supporting active cancellation should not require a change to the kernel API when we can just define the API in a general way without reference to `std::atomic<bool>` right now.\r\n\r\n- The API in the branch is friendlier than the API in the PR. Adding the interrupt object to the kernel::Context struct is nicer than requiring the application to initialize the interrupt object itself. Not every application needs to cancel kernel operations (bitcoin-chainstate.cpp is one example) so requiring those applications to declare an atomic shutdown variable adds boilerplate and complexity. You could address this by moving the atomic bool into kernel::Context. But even with that change I still think SignalInterrupt interface is cleaner than the atomic bool interface.\r\n\r\nI understand the approach in the PR makes kernel a littler smaller and lightweight, but to me overhead of depending on CThreadInterrupt, TokenPipe, SignalInterrupt, and unistd.h does not seem high enough to worry about. Also, whatever overhead there is here is an implemention detail of the kernel, and can be changed later. It's not something that's hardcoded into the kernel API.",

      "body": "> Thank you for your comprehensive answer. I think it boils down to: A fatal error should not necessarily have to trigger an interrupt for all kernel operations.\r\n\r\nYes, this is definitely a goal. Libbitcoinkernel should try to be a library, not an application or application framework. It should have a convenient way of cancelling operations and not force everything to use one shutdown variable.\r\n\r\nBut both the current PR and my branch do already support this. The main difference between the PR and branch is that the PR uses a `std::atomic<bool>` object, while the branch uses a `SignalInterrupt` object.\r\n\r\n> Going back to this earlier remark again, you declared the `m_interrupt` member in your branch as `const`. Do you think it is a bad idea to mutate it from within the chainman to forego a call to `StartShutdown`?\r\n\r\nIt's not necessarily bad, but it would be nice to avoid it. It would be cleaner if interrupt state cleanly represented whether a cancellation was requested or not, and wasn't also used to handle the `-stopatheight` and `-stopafterblockimport` corner cases.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I was thinking of suggesting dropping the last commit a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5 from the current PR, and leaving the two `StartShutdown()` calls in place for now. I think a better approach than calling `StartShutdown()` or calling `m_interrupt()` in those cases would be to just return \"finished\" or \"success\" status codes. Also in both cases, it would be better if the kernel wasn't deciding itself whether to return early, but instead asked the application through std::function callbacks. I.e. there could be a std::function callbacks for \"I just a new chain tip, should I keep processing or return early?\" that would be more general than having hardcoded `-stopatheight` logic in the kernel. The third \"FailedConnectingBestBlock\" shutdown case also seems like it should be returning a real error code to the application and calling fatalErrror, not just sending a shutdown notification.\r\n",
