It is currently only accessible through the test-only `-bip324=` command-line option, which specifies IPs, host names, or subnets for which to use BIP324 connections. This option is only added in order to make experimentation possible; I don't expect it will be supported long-term (or should even remain in this PR).\r\n\r\nStill missing features are:\r\n* Support for the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag.\r\n* Automatically trying V2 connections when the service flag is set.\r\n* Retrying downgrade to V1 when attempted outbound V2 connections immediately fail.\r\n* P2P functional tests (only a fuzz test for the transport is included, and a few bitcoind-to-bitcoind functional tests)\r\n\r\nOther than that, support for V2 connections is functionally complete, including:\r\n* Autodetection of incoming V1 connections.\r\n* Garbage, both sending and receiving.\r\n* Short message type IDs, both sending and receiving.\r\n* Ignore packets (receiving only, and untested).\r\n* Session IDs are visible in `getpeerinfo` output (for manual comparison).\r\n",

They'll all be removed when the parent PRs get merged.\r\n\r\n### commits overview\r\n1. Introducing cryptographic constructs(HKDF, ECDH, ChaCha20, Poly1305, FSChaCha20 and FSChaCha20Poly1305) in the test framework to help with P2P encryption.\r\n2. Performing v2 P2P encryption in a v2 connection.\r\n    * introduces a new class `EncryptedP2PState` to store the keys, functions for performing the initial v2 handshake and encryption/decryption.\r\n    * this class is used by `P2PConnection` in inbound/outbound connections to perform the initial v2 handshake before the v1 version handshake. Only after the initial v2 handshake is performed do application layer P2P messages(version, verack etc..) get exchanged. (in a v2 connection)\r\n    * the encrypted P2P messages follow a different format - 3 byte length + 1-13 byte message_type + payload + 16 byte MAC\r\n    * includes support for testing decoy messages and v2 connection downgrade(using false advertisement - when a v2 node makes an outbound connection to a node which doesn't support v2 but is advertised as v2 by some malicious\r\nintermediary)\r\n\r\n### run the tests\r\n* functional test - `test/functional/p2p_v2_encrypted.py` `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py`\r\n\r\nI'm also super grateful to @ dhruv for his really valuable feedback on this branch.",

          "body": "This PR furthers the P2P message serialization/deserialization abstraction introduced in #16202 and #16562, in preparation for introducing the BIP324 v2 transport (making this part of #27634). However, nothing in this PR is BIP324-specific, and it contains a number of independently useful improvements.\r\n\r\nThe overall idea is to have a single object in every `CNode` (called `m_transport`) that is responsible for converting sent messages to wire bytes, and for converting received wire bytes back to messages, while having as little as possible knowledge about this conversion process in higher-level net code. To accomplish that, there is an abstract `Transport` class with (currently) a single `V1Transport` implementation.\r\n\r\nStructurally, the above is accomplished by:\r\n* Merging the `TransportDeserializer` and `TransportSerializer` classes into a single `Transport` class, which encompasses both the sending and receiving side. For `V1Transport` these two sides are entirely separate, but this assumption doesn't hold for the BIP324 transport where e.g. the sending encryption key depends on the DH key negotiation data received from the other side. Merging the two means a future `V2Transport` can handle all this interaction without callers needing to be aware.\r\n* Removing the assumption that each message is sent using a computed header followed by (unmodified) data bytes. To achieve that, the sending side of `Transport` mirrors what the receiver side does: callers can set a message to be sent, then ask what bytes must be sent out, and then allowing them to transition to the next message.\r\n* Adding internal locks to protect the sending and receiving state of the `V1Transport` implementation. I believe these aren't strictly needed (opinions welcome) as there is no real way to use `Transport` objects in a multi-threaded fashion without some form of external synchronization (e.g. \"get next bytes to send\" isn't meaningful to call from multiple threads at the same time without mechanism to control the order they'll actually get sent). Still, I feel it's cleaner to make the object responsible for its own consistency (as we definitely do not want the entire object to be under a single external GUARDED_BY, as that'd prevent simultaneous sending and receiving).\r\n* Moving the conversion of messages to bytes on the sending side from `PushMessage` to `SocketSendData`, which is needed to deal with the fact that a transport may not immediately be able to send messages.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a refactor, though some commits are. Among the semantic changes are:\r\n* Changing the send buffer pushback mechanism to trigger based on the memory usage of the buffer rather than the amount of bytes to be sent. This is both closer to the desired behavior, and makes the buffering independent from transport details (which is why it's included here).\r\n* When optimistic send is not applicable, the V1 message checksum calculation now runs in the net thread rather than the message handling thread. I believe that's generally an improvement, as the message handling thread is far more computationally bottlenecked already.\r\n* The checksum calculation now runs under the `CNode::cs_vSend` lock, which does mean no two checksum calculations for messages sent to the same node can run in parallel, even if running in separate threads. Despite that limitation, having the checksum for non-optimistic sends moved in the net thread is still an improvement, I believe.\r\n* Statistics for per-message-type sent bytes are now updated when the bytes are actually handed to the OS rather than in `PushMessage`. This is because the actual serialized sizes aren't known until they've gone through the transport object.\r\n\r\nA fuzz test of the entire `V1Transport` is included. More elaborate rationale for each of the changes can be found in the commit messages.",

          "body": "See https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/issues/1233. There, it has been observed that if both sides of a P2P connection have a significant amount of data to send, a stall can occur, where both try to drain their own send queue before trying to receive. The same issue seems to apply to the current Bitcoin Core codebase, though I don't know whether it's a frequent issue for us.\r\n\r\nThe core issue is that whenever our optimistic send fails to fully send a message, we do subsequently not even select() for receiving; if it then turns out that sending is not possible either, no progress is made at all. To address this, the solution used in this PR is to still select() for both sending and receiving when an optimistic send fails, but skip receiving if sending succeeded, and (still) doesn't fully drain the send queue.\r\n\r\nThis is a significant reduction in how aggressive the \"receive pushback\" mechanism is, because now it will only mildly push back while sending progress is made; if the other side stops receiving entirely, the pushback disappears. I don't think that's a serious problem though:\r\n* We still have a pushback mechanism at the application buffer level (when the application receive buffer overflows, receiving is paused until messages in the buffer get processed; waiting on our own net_processing thread, not on the remote party).\r\n* There are cases where the existing mechanism is too aggressive; e.g. when the send queue is non-empty, but tiny, and can be sent with a single send() call. In that case, I think we'd prefer to still receive within the same processing loop of the network thread.\r\n",

          "body": "This proposes two things:\r\n\r\n1. Make AddrFetch connections to fixed seeds instead of just adding them to AddrMan (suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25678#issuecomment-1210858925)\r\nWhen adding fixed seeds, we currently add them to AddrMan and then make regular full outbound connections to them. If many new nodes use the fixed seeds for this, it will result in them getting a lot of peers requiring IBD, which will create a lot of traffic for them. With an AddrFetch connection, we will only use them to get addresses from other peers and disconnect afterwards.\r\nThis PR proposes to attempt making AddrFetch connections to 10 peers for better diversity (some may be offline anyway). The fixed seeds will still be added to Addrman as before, but only after a delay of 2 minutes, after which they will hopefully no longer be the only entries in AddrMan.\r\n\r\n2. Move the logic of adding fixed seeds out of `ThreadOpenConnections` into `ThreadDNSAddressSeed` (which is being renamed to `ThreadAddressSeed`).\r\nI think this makes sense in general because adding the fixed seeds is in many ways analogous to querying the DNS seeds, and ThreadOpenConnections, which is there to actually open the connections is already quite complex.\r\nAlso, it makes the changes from 1) easier if we don't have to worry about interfering with the automatic connection making logic.\r\n\r\nOne way to test this is to start without `peers.dat` and run with `-nodnsseed -blocksonly -debug=net` and monitor the debug log and `bitcoin-cli -netinfo` behavior.",
