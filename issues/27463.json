          "body": "Part of package relay, see #27463.\r\n\r\nNote that this still allows packages to bump transactions that are below the dynamic mempool minimum feerate, which means this still solves the \"mempool is congested and my presigned 1sat/vB tx is screwed\" problem for all transactions.\r\n\r\nOn master, the package policy (only accessible through regtest-only RPC submitpackage) allows 0-fee (or otherwise below min relay feerate) transactions if they are bumped by a child. However, with default package limits, we don't yet have a DoS-resistant way of ensuring these transactions remain bumped throughout their time in the mempool. Primarily, the fee-bumping child may later be replaced by another transaction that doesn't bump the parent(s). The parent(s) could potentially stay bumped by other transactions, but not enough to ever be selected by the `BlockAssembler` (due to `blockmintxfee`).\r\n\r\nFor example, (tested [here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/commits/26933-motivation)):\r\n- The mempool accepts 24 below-minrelayfeerate transactions (\"0-fee parents\"), all bumped by a single high-fee transaction (\"the fee-bumping child\"). The fee-bumping child also spends a confirmed UTXO.\r\n- Two additional children are added to each 0-fee parent. These children each pay a feerate slightly above the minimum relay feerate (e.g. 1.9sat/vB) such that, for each 0-fee parent, the total fees of its two children divided by the total size of the children and parent is above the minimum relay feerate.\r\n- If a block template is built now, all transactions would be selected.\r\n- A transaction replaces the the fee-bumping child, spending only the confirmed UTXO and not any of the outputs from the 0-fee parents.\r\n - The 0-fee parents now each have 2 children. Their descendant feerates are above minrelayfeerate, which means that they remain in the mempool, even if the mempool evicts all below-minrelayfeerate packages.\r\n - If a block template is built now, none of the 0-fee parents or their children would be selected.\r\n - Even more low-feerate descendants can be added to these below-minrelayfeerate packages and they will not be evicted until they expire or the mempool reaches capacity.\r\n\r\nUnless we have a DoS-resistant way of ensuring package CPFP-bumped transactions are always bumped, allowing package CPFP to bump below-minrelayfeerate transactions can result in these problematic situations. See #27018 which proposes a partial solution with some limitations, and contains discussion about potential improvements to eviction strategy. While no adequate solution exists, for now, avoid these situations by requiring all transactions to meet min relay feerate.",

      "body": "I think one more sub-category to track is the feedback collected on how package relay/nversion=3 are fitting multi-party applications and contracting protocols\r\n- Lightning: legacy channels / anchor output / taproot types\r\n- Peerswap: claim with preimage + refund cooperatively + refund after csv passes\r\n- Collaborative transaction: splicing + dual funding flows\r\n\r\nThe [0-conf flow](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/910) of Lightning can be also considered. As deployed today by some LSPs where both incoming/outgoing HTLCs are allowed during the pending confirmation period, there is a risk in case of mempool congestions of the inbound funding transaction not confirming before the timelock of the offered HTLC output expires. The current nversion=3 size is 1000 vb which might be too low if LSPs would like to do batching of 0-confs. Note, I think all the pinning risks are not the same for 0-conf funding transactions than for time-sensitive confirmation of LN commitment+HTLCs transactions.\r\n\r\nMentioning 0-conf, and as raised on [#27643](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26525#issuecomment-1473067644) at some point in the development cycle of nversion=3 it might be good communication practice to publish than all 0confs users might have to upgrade their mempool monitoring stuff to reject nversion=3, or chain of transactions with them, as otherwise genuine upgrade to the version of Core with package relay might lower their security.\r\n\r\nFor Lightning, there is the question if the p2p package format is flexible enough for the Lightning channels to apply \"new mempool rules\" on \"old in-flight channnel type\". Like backward compatible effect of the mempools rules without off-chain channels having to cooperate on-resigning transactions. I believe that would require a Lightning node to sign the p2p package with the same pubkey than used with the channel (though I start to think we might have multiple types of backward/forward compatible application of mempools rules like the ones mentioned in [#25038](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038#issuecomment-1405944407), like there is some matrix ?)\r\n\r\nFor the second-layers listed, I'm just considering the ones which have a) a mature specification and b) some substantial deployment though should we consider more second-layers or multi-party applications like vaults (non-deployed) ?\r\n\r\nFrom a reviewer viewpoint, I think it could be very valuable if you can highlight the 2/3 PRs or mail posts you consider as top of the stack for reviews ? Thanks for a package-relay context-tracking meta-issue.\r\n\r\n(Feel free to integrate what you find relevant of this comment to ease context tracking of package relay as a project)",

It should behave no differently to submitting the transactions individually with a non-full mempool, no?\r\n\r\nSomewhat. It's still a little bit weird when you submit a child-with-parents where a parent relies on the other (grep \"Check that validation isn't quitting *too* early\" in #26711, currently [at this line](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26711/files#diff-98ca28aa44cf84d5a29e4ce7eddbabf495a51154b02a6703a78977b80e19b17aR436)). I would say it's safe after the \"submit with subpackages\" changes.\r\n\r\nAlso, mempools *are* full on mainnet (great for testing but means there is a difference), and we'll definitely want to warn them that the transactions are not necessarily relayed etc.",

          "body": "This contains everything to make mempool/validation logic ready for package relay (see #27463).\r\n\r\nDesign goals:\r\n- Be able to gracefully deal with any arbitrary list of transactions (these come from p2p)\r\n- Validate any ancestor package so that the incentive-compatible transactions end up in our mempool.\r\n  - If the transactions would be accepted individually, they should also be accepted through `AcceptPackage`. We don't want to accidentally reject things just because we happened to download them as a package.\r\n  - Bug prior to these changes: we required `IsChildWithParents` but if there were dependencies between the parents, we could end up (1) accepting a low-feerate child or (2) rejecting a high-feerate parent CPFPing another parent. See the \"interdependent parents\" test case for a specific example.\r\n- Be DoS-resistant.\r\n   - Avoid quadratic validation costs.\r\n   - Avoid loading a lot of stuff from disk, or loading repeatedly.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 main improvements to package evaluation here:\r\n(1) We submit transactions with their in-package ancestor sets.\r\n\t-  See unit test `package_ppfp`: without this change, we would reject everything.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_ppfc`: shows that this doesn't let us do \"parent pays for child;\" we only do this when the individual and ancestor feerates meet mempool minimum feerate\r\n(2) We linearize the package transactions based on ancestor set scoring.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_needs_reorder`: without this change, if we use the original order of transactions, we would only accept 1 grandparent, even if we submit subpackages.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_desc_limits`: without this change, we accept one of the lower-feerate transactions (a bit more of a \"nice to have\" than a \"must have\" example).\r\n\r\nA description of the package validation logic (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26711#issuecomment-1647523520):\r\n\r\n- Basic sanitization. Quit if it's too big, inconsistent, etc.\r\n- Linearize (Topological sort only)\r\n- **PreChecks loop** For each tx, grab UTXOs to calculate fees and filter out anything we should skip:\r\n    - If already in mempool (or same txid in mempool), mark as skip\r\n    - If missing inputs or conflict, record this failure and mark this and all descendants as skip.\r\n    - If no failures or TX_SINGLE_FAILURE, continue\r\n    - For some failures that we expect due to differing chainstates, skip these transactions and their descendants, but continue.\r\n    - Otherwise, record this failure and mark that we will `quit_early` (i.e. not do the Subpackage validation loop).\r\n- Refine our linearization using the fee information.\r\n- **Subpackage validation loop** For each transaction in the new linearized order:\r\n    - Get the transaction's ancestor subpackage.\r\n    - If the feerate of this transaction is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - If the feerate of this subpackage is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - Otherwise, try to submit the subpackage, using `AcceptSingleTransaction()` if it's just 1 tx\r\n    - if at any point we get a non-fee-related error, abort all.\r\n- Call `LimitMempoolSize`\r\n- Backfill results:\r\n    - If the transaction was in mempool, check to see if it's still there in case it was trimmed in `LimitMempoolSize`.\r\n    - Try to use results from the subpackage validation loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early), use results from prechecks loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early and we hadn't found a failure with it yet), fill with `TX_UNKNOWN`.\r\n\r\nThis means we will call `PreChecks` for each transaction 2 times (fewer if we quit early), and run all other validation checks at most 1 time. A transaction shouldn't be validated in the subpackage validation loop more than once.",

          "body": "**Note: this PR has been superseded by #28948 (v3) and #28984 (package RBF)**\r\n\r\nSee #27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 2 projects: v3 policy and package RBF. Mailing list posts: [package RBF 1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019464.html) and [V3 + package RBF 2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html). It stems from a long discussion about RBF pinning, across a [mailing list thread](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html) and [gist](https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff).\r\n\r\nV3 Policy: A set of policy rules applied to transactions with their `nVersion` field set to 3. Namely, it allows users to opt in to more restrictive descendant limits for shared transactions. If adopted by many nodes in the network, V3 mitigates various RBF pinning attacks. See doc/policy/version3_transactions.md for the exact rules and rationale, and [these review club notes](bitcoincore.reviews/25038) for more background and discussion.\r\n\r\nPackage RBF: In addition to allowing a child to pay for its parents within the package, also allow the child to pay for replacing the parent's conflicts. For example, this allows LN users to replace commitment transactions existing in the mempool, simply by broadcasting their respective commitment transactions with a high-fee child. The commitment transactions can be signed with 0 fees, which means no overpaying.\r\n\r\nFAQ: is v3 still helpful even with cluster mempool (#27677) ?\r\n\r\n- Rule 3 pinning: This is addressed with v3 but not really with cluster mempool (descendant allowance is still too permissive).\r\n- Package RBF and ACP pinning: This PR allows for package RBF with v3 packages. V3 has an effective \"cluster limit\" of 2 which makes it very cheap to calculate the mining score of a v3 transaction. With cluster mempool, which also makes it easier to calculate mining score, we could have package RBF for non-v3 transactions.\r\n- Allowing 0fee transactions: This PR allows v3 transactions to be below minimum relay feerate, provided they are CPFP'd. This is because the simplified topology allows us to avoid situations like the ones described in #26933. With cluster mempool, we can allow this for non-v3 transactions.",

          "title": "[NO MERGE] BIP331 Ancestor Package Relay",
          "body": "**WORK IN PROGRESS.** Please do not run it for any use other than testing.\r\n  \r\nThis PR is not meant for merge. This branch exists to help reviewers see what package relay would look like all together. I will open separate PRs for these components and expect to add more tests, docs, and polish along the way. This PR contains all of the functionality built in a linear manner. However, since there are pieces in various areas of the codebase and they can make progress in parallel, commits don't necessarily need to be merged in this order.\r\n\r\n**See #27463 for what PR(s) are open for review right now.**\r\n\r\n## Note to Reviewers\r\n\r\nThe major purpose of this PR is to solicit \"approach\" review.\r\n\r\nThis is a large project, and the first few p2p commits essentially define the interface. I'd like to get rough consensus on approach before we start looking at code details and merging PRs, because I believe it will help us \"get useful stuff in\" faster and avoid premature optimizations.\r\n\r\nHere are some questions I hope are answered before we try to merge anything (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27742#issuecomment-1572205313):\r\n\r\n1. Does the proposed protocol look sound?\r\n2. Are these 3 milestones appropriate?\r\n3. Is there important functionality that is in the \"todo improvements\" section but should be included in one of the 3 milestones? Alternatively, is there not-that-important stuff in the milestones that we should defer until later?\r\n4. Does it make sense to have this PeerManager <-> TxDownloadMan interface?\r\n\r\nComments about naming, typos, code details, etc. are also appreciated but please note I may wait until their respective PRs are open to incorporate your comments. Thank you for your patience.\r\n\r\n### Design Docs\r\n\r\nBIP: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1382\r\nOrphanage changes: https://gist.github.com/glozow/7c0ff639f996e660146314edffa6f06c\r\n\r\n## Project Structure\r\n\r\n### 3 Major Milestones\r\n\r\nThis project is split into 3 milestones, each of which gives us something useful.\r\n\r\n1. Modularize and improve orphan-handling (also some refactoring).\r\n\t- Introduce a `TxDownloadManager` class, responsible for downloading transactions that have been announced to us.\r\n\t- Use all announcers as potential candidates for resolving an orphan. Add a `TxRequestTracker` Orphan Request Tracker which helps track orphans we need to resolve. Preferentially request orphan resolution from outbounds, preferred relay, etc., over inbounds.\r\n\r\n2. When package relay peers are available, use `ancpkginfo` instead of missing parents when handling orphans.\r\n\t- Add `sendpackages` negotiation logic.\r\n\t- Add a separate rejections filter for transactions that are eligible for reconsideration when validated together as a package, so that children of low-feerate transactions are still considered.\r\n\t- Send `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO)` to package relay peers for orphan resolution. Use `ancpkginfo` to request missing ancestors through normal individual transaction relay.\r\n\r\n3. Download and validate ancestor packages using `getpkgtxns` and `pkgtxns`.\r\n\t- Add support for `getpkgtxns` and `pkgtxns`. Send a `pkgtxns` using the list of missing transactions from `ancpkginfo`.\r\n\t- Ensure we can process \"normal\" orphans even if a peer is trying to overwhelm/churn our orphanage. Do this by \"opportunistically\" protecting orphans from random eviction if they were sent by package relay peers, and redownloading orphans if we cannot afford to protect them. Each peer is allocated a certain amount of orphans they can protect at a time (\"token bucket\" style but the number of tokens is static for now). Outbound peers get more than inbounds.\r\n\t- If a transaction's parent(s) are below the fee filter, don't announce it (save the bandwidth of legacy nodes).\r\n\r\n###  Todo improvements \r\nThese could be added to the milestones or deferred until basic functionality is deployed.\r\n- Store orphans serialized instead of as CTransactionRefs to significantly reduce their memory usage.\r\n- Perhaps try to keep orphans in disk and/or process them asynchronously, given the incredibly DoSable nature of orphan handling.\r\n- Dynamically allocate tokens for orphan protection. For example, if a long-standing inbound peer continuously provides good packages for orphans, they should have more tokens. If a peer is obviously serving us garbage, reduce their tokens.\r\n- Detect when we have received all the transactions for a package, regardless of how (individual or block or other), and return `PackageToValidate`  in `GetTxToReconsider`.\r\n- New format for mempool.dat, packages instead of transactions.",

I strongly suggest that reviewers look at that PR first to decide if they are comfortable with the overall approach.\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly refactors, with a few behavior changes and improvements:\r\n- Introduces `TxDownloadManager`, which handles all transaction downloading. It contains the `TxRequestTracker`, `TxOrphanage`, and filters for `AlreadyHaveTx`.\r\n- Updates logs for tx {validation, relay, orphans} to include both txid and wtxid when possible.\r\n- Adds a new log category, `TXPACKAGES`. Logging in the orphanage is changed from `MEMPOOL` to `TXPACKAGES`.\r\n- Adds support for tracking when multiple peers provided the same tx in the orphanage.\r\n- Makes `TxDownloadManager` responsible for tracking the orphans we need to resolve and deciding how/when to resolve them.\r\n- Adds all announcers of an orphan as potential resolution candidates. This tracker is a `TxDownloadManager` which helps us schedule requests.\r\n   - In this PR, \"orphan resolution\" means requesting missing parents by `getdata(MSG_TX | MSG_WITNESS_FLAG, missing_txid)`.\r\n    - In a future PR, we'll add another resolution method, requesting ancestor wtxids using `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO, orphan_wtxid)`.",

      "body": "From a reviewing standpoint on #27742, I think it would benefit if the release aim for current package version (BIP331 + nversion=3 policy regime) is explicitly bounded to Lightning time-sensitive confirmation flows, especially in matters of DoS protection:\r\n- broadcast of revoked transaction output spend\r\n- broadcast of a commitment transaction with pending HTLC outputs and its associated second-stage transactions\r\n\r\nI think this covers the most sensitive Lightning flows impacted by the pinning attacks mentioned as a design goal by BIP331. However this left of out considerations the following multi-party contract protocols and subsidiary Lightning flows:\r\n- submarine swaps e.g peerswap\r\n- LN dual-funding and splicing (package relay has been discussed as a griefing mitigation on the lightning dev mailing list iirc)\r\n- Taprooted wallet with time-sensitive script path\r\n\r\nI think this is opportune to say so on the mailing list and therefore avoid multi-party applications or contracting protocols having to complaint than this deployment of package relay doesn’t fit their use-case (kind of like we have with the mempoolfullrbf debate). Beyond, I would say it’s valuable to announce latest BIP331 (minor) changes, if it does change something for the p2p network, that we would have missed from the Bitcoin Core-side.",

The draft spec can be found at hlightning/bolts/pull/863 with an overview of proposed changes from eclair's implementation in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/t-bast/1ac31f4e27734a10c5b9847d06db8d86). The dependent quiescence protocol can be found at lightning/bolts/pull/869.\r\n\r\nThese two features involve somewhat intertwined work which we track here:\r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] Wire messages for ItxC, dual-funding, and splicing\r\n  * #1794\r\n      - [x] `OptionalField` is obsolete and would affect some ItxC fields #2253\r\n  * Add wire messages for quiescence and splicing\r\n- [ ] V2 channel establishment\r\n  - [x] Untangle inbound and outbound channels while also differentiating between V1 and V2 channels #2077\r\n  - [x] #2382 \r\n  * #2302\r\n    * Introduce `(Inbound/Outbound)V2Channel`s\r\n    * Handle `OpenChannelV2` and `OpenChannelV1` messages and construct prefunded channels ready for ItxC\r\n  * When ItxC is ready, hook up establishment for full end to end flow.\r\n- [ ] Dual-funding feature bits \r\n- [ ] Interactive Transaction Construction\r\n  * #2419 \r\n  * Work on RBF mechanism for common bumping of txs in protocols depending on ItxC.\r\n- [ ] Quiescence protocol\r\n- [ ] Splicing\r\n- [ ] Interop tests with CLN and Eclair\r\n",

This helps us retry resolving the same orphan with multiple peers if it fails the first time.\r\n- Store the deduplicated missing parent txids in `OrphanTx` so that we don't need to calculate them again later on.\r\n- Return the erased wtxids from `EraseForBlock` which includes orphans that conflicted with the block. This helps us delete those orphan resolution attempts from our tracker.\r\n- Enable limiting the total size of orphans instead of just the total count. No new limits are introduced, the default is maximum count * maximum tx size.\r\n- Unit tests + fuzzer.",

          "title": "Package relay design questions",
          "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about some improvements to transaction relay and wanted some feedback about the design goals.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nA transaction is only accepted to our mempool and then relayed to our peers if (a) our mempool already has all unconfirmed dependencies of the transaction, and (b) the transaction itself passes a bunch of policy checks (feerate, package size limits, etc).\r\n\r\nIt is possible for one transaction to fail our feerate policy check, but had it been bundled with another child transaction, that the transactions together should make it in to our mempool (eg because the child's feerate is sufficiently high).  Here are some scenarios where this can come up:\r\n\r\n * A node on the network has a smaller mempool than the default/typical setting.  Our default mempool size is 300MB (huge); it seems like it should be the case that someone running a node with, say, a 20MB mempool ought to have all the transactions that will be appearing in the next block.  However, nodes running with smaller mempools can have a higher effective minimum feerate required for transaction acceptance (this is a consequence of our mempool limiting/eviction policy), and so high feerate children of a low feerate parent -- which might appear in the next block -- may never make it in to the mempool of such a node.\r\n\r\n * Matt Corallo recently wrote about an example on the bitcoin-dev mailing list involving lightning transactions, where pre-signed transactions might be broadcast to the blockchain long after they were generated, and thus not have been created with a fee that is sufficient to be confirmed quickly (or even be accepted to node mempools).  In such situations, channel participants may need to use chained transactions (CPFP) in order to increase the confirmation speed of such transactions, and that implies we may need to introduce a mechanism for those parent transactions to be relayed along with their higher feerate children, even if the parent transaction would be rejected by itself.\r\n\r\n*Are there other scenarios that suffer without a package relay solution, which have unique design requirements?*\r\n\r\n# Design questions\r\n\r\n## Who is responsible for initiating package relay, sender or recipient?\r\n\r\nWhile the sender of a transaction that is chained off a low-fee parent is well-positioned to guess that a transaction might need package relay in order to propagate, expecting relayers to do the same seems onerous and potentially bandwidth wasteful.  For example, one way for a sender-initiated package relay system to work might be for a sender to announce via an INV (or similar) all ancestor txid's along with a child txid.  However, what would the protocol look like beyond that first hop -- would each node on the network initiate package relay with their peers as well?  It seems like this could be used in a way that would cause the same txid's to be announced repeatedly on the same links in the network, which seems wasteful.  Is there a sender-initiated strategy that works better than this naive idea that we should consider?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the recipient of a transaction can tell if a transaction's parents are missing and can therefore know to initiate package relay from the sending peer (which means that package relay would only occur on links that require it, eg to/from low-memory-mempool nodes).\r\n\r\n## Should we update the p2p protocol to accommodate package relay, or rely on existing functionality?\r\n\r\nIn theory, we may be able to shoehorn a recipient-initiated package relay scheme within the existing p2p protocol.  A recipient who needs the parents of a transaction could iteratively request them, and then topologically sort the result once all ancestors have arrived, and then proceed with validation.\r\n\r\nBut in practice, it seems like it might be much simpler to reason about the code and computational complexity if we add some kind of special p2p messages to assist in the process, so that rather than iteratively request parents (for example) we could just ask a peer for all unconfirmed ancestors of a transaction, perhaps even already sorted in topological order. It's also possible that it'd be helpful to add information or requirements around the package feerate of such packages.\r\n\r\nThe obvious benefit to not updating the p2p protocol is that we could implement package relay in a new release and the whole network would support providing packages to new software.  The downside is potential code complexity and possibly somewhat less efficient processing of transactions due to repeatedly having to check for missing ancestors and doing the topological sort (but perhaps those could be mitigated with the right implementation).\r\n\r\n## What Denial-of-Service concerns do we need to address?\r\n\r\nIn addition to the usual things we worry about (bandwidth attacks on the network, CPU or other resource exhaustion attacks), does package relay need to incorporate further anti-DoS measures to be useful?\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose there is some low feerate transaction A, and it has multiple children: B, C, D, E ...  One of our peers relays transaction B to us, so we ask for A, but decide that A+B is not good enough for our mempool.  How many times will we be willing to re-try A, if C, D, E, etc are also relayed to us?\r\n\r\nOne approach might be to only attempt the same transaction once over some time period (say by adding it to our reject filter, which gets cleared out every block), so that the same transaction cannot be repeatedly used to CPU-attack us; however, this would seem to conflict with the lightning use-case, where we would not want an adversary to be able to prevent relay of some parent transaction.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, any situation where we might test a transaction's signatures prior to a (package-) policy failure that prevents the transaction from being ultimately accepted to the mempool would open the door to CPU-exhaustion attacks.  This would imply a design for package processing and acceptance where policy checks on the whole package are performed before signature validation -- then, if a signature is found to be invalid, we could ban the peer.  Are there any other practical solutions for this?  If we take this approach, then it seems we could re-try A over and over with limited downside.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note the existing resource usage that transaction relay can already incur -- when we receive a new transaction, we generally have to retrieve the inputs from the utxo set, which typically means that an attacker can make us do disk reads costlessly. Given that this seems difficult to avoid, I don't think package relay needs to limit an attacker's ability to have us look up inputs.  I think this implies that in the previous example, being willing to retry A+C, A+D, etc and looking up A's inputs over and over shouldn't be considered an increase in attack surface.\r\n\r\n## Consistency requirements?\r\n\r\nAre there any additional consistency requirements we should (or must) impose on package relay?  Currently it is the case that\r\nthe order that transactions are received by a node does determine which transactions make it into the mempool (some examples that come to mind: transactions that are just at the mempool min fee rate; transactions that depend on common ancestors which are near the descendant chain limit; a transaction that would conflict with another vs descendants of that original transaction; I'm sure there are more examples).\r\n\r\nNaively, we might also expect it to be the case that depending on how a package is relayed, it might affect whether a child transaction is accepted.  For instance, if we have a parent transaction A, with two children B and C, then it's possible that B+A has a high enough feerate to be accepted via package relay, but C+A does not -- so relaying B first would get all 3 transactions in, while relaying C first would only get A and B in.\r\n\r\nThis effect could be magnified if there were (for example) anti-DoS rules that would prevent A from being attempted too many times.\r\n\r\nWould this kind of behavior significantly harm any use cases that we're trying to support?",

This is part of #27463.\r\n\r\n- Add 2 new TxValidationResults\r\n  - `TX_RECONSIDERABLE` helps us encode transactions who have failed fee checks that can be bypassed using package validation. This is distinguished from `TX_MEMPOOL_POLICY` so that we re-validate a transaction if and only if it is eligible for package CPFP. In the future, we will have a separate cache for reconsiderable rejects so these transactions don't go in `m_recent_rejects`.\r\n  - `TX_UNKNOWN` helps us communicate that we aborted package validation and didn't finish looking at this transaction: it's not valid but it's also not invalid (i.e. don't cache it as a rejected tx)\r\n- Return effective feerate and the wtxids of transactions used to calculate that effective feerate when the error is `TX_SINGLE_FAILURE`. Previously, we would only provide this information if the transaction passed. Now that we have package validation, it's much more helpful to the caller to know how the failing feerate was calculated. This can also be used to improve our submitpackage RPC result (which is currently a bit unhelpful when things fail).\r\n- Use the newly added `CheckPackageMempoolAcceptResult` for existing package validation tests. This increases test coverage and helps test the changes made in this PR.",

      "body": "There have been discussions on what package validation and RBF rules will look like in a post-cluster mempool world. #26711 either doesn't work with cluster mempool or should not be considered until after cluster mempool. #26711 supports certain types of package submission that we might not be able to continue to support with cluster mempool depending on what approach is taken. There are different ideas on how to consider subsets of packages to accept when it doesn't make sense to take all or none. IIUC the approach taken in #26711 (which is to do subpackage evaluation) no longer has conceptual support which is why I closed it.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is a circular dependency between cluster mempool and package relay. (1) We want cluster mempool before package RBF since it allows us to assess incentive compatibility much more easily. (2) Cluster mempool requires the removal of CPFP carve out in order to switch from ancestor/descendant-based package limits to cluster limits. But there are people who rely on CPFP carve out for bumping presigned transactions; we need to build a replacement (i.e. package relay + package RBF).\r\n\r\nSo the new plan of attack is to first create 1-parent-1-child package relay, including package RBF for v3 transactions. This allows the users of CPFP carve out to switch, thus allowing us to remove CPFP carve out and then add cluster mempool. This also allows us to defer the decision-making on what package evaluation and package RBF will look like in a post-cluster mempool world.",

These policies help mitigate many pinning attacks and make package RBF feasible (see #25038 which implements package RBF on top of this). [1][2]\r\n- Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see #27677 and #28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n\r\nV3 policy [3] allows users to opt in to more restrictive topological limits for shared transactions. Even though we don't have cluster limits, we are able to treat these transactions as having as having a maximum cluster size of 2. If adopted by many nodes in the network, V3 mitigates various RBF pinning attacks. The \"cluster limit\" allows us to do things like calculate the \"miner score\" of a transaction and permit below-minrelayfeerate transactions.\r\n\r\n[1]: Original mailing list post and discussion about RBF pinning problems https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html, https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff\r\n[2]: A FAQ is \"we need this for cluster mempool, but is this still necessary afterwards?\" There are some pinning issues that are fixed here and not fully fixed in cluster mempool, so we will continue to use this or something similar afterward.\r\n[3]: Mailing list post for v3 https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html",

See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n- Package relay is nice [1]. Relaying 1-parent-1-child CPFP when mempool min feerate is high would be a subset of the use cases, but a pretty significant improvement over what we have today.\r\n- Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27677 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n- The majority of this code is useful for building e.g. #27742.\r\n\r\nThis means 1p1c packages propagate in the \"happy case\" where nobody is deliberately withholding packages. To make this more robust, we need receiver-side logic to retry orphan resolution with multiple peers. Also, since we rely on the orphanage to remember the child while waiting for the parent, peers may cause us to drop packages by sending lots of orphans. To make this robust, we need to make efforts to protect some amount of orphans from eviction.\r\n\r\n[1]: see this writeup and its links https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/02ec218c7857ef60914e9a3d383b68caf987f70b/bip-0331.mediawiki#propagate-high-feerate-transactions",
