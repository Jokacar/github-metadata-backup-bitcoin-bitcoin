    "title": "Duplicate getheaders requests",
    "body": "During the initial headers download, a client may start to request the same headers multiple times from its syncing peer.  This happens if a new block is found while the peer is syncing, for the following reason:\n\nFor the ordinary headers syncing procedure, the client starts by asking for an initial set of headers, and then whenever it receives a message with 2,000 headers, it follows up with a request for more.  _However_, if a new block is found, its peer sends a corresponding inv message, which prompts the syncing client to _also_ ask for the headers preceding the new block.  This requests the same headers again, and when they are received a second time, it continues requesting more.  Depending on how many new blocks are found and how long the header syncing lasts, this may lead to a situation where the same set of headers is requested many times.\n\nThis obviously puts unnecessary strain on both the client that syncs and the peer that sends the data.  This is a problem particularly for altcoins with either of a high block frequency or merge-mining (much larger header messages), but it happens with Bitcoin itself as well.\n\nTo fix it, we could keep (in-memory only) for each peer the highest \"from\" height for which we requested headers from it.  Whenever a new request would be sent with a smaller number, we drop it instead.  Alternatively, one could probably also make the logic for requesting headers following an inv message smarter, so that it does not request when we are in the initial headers sync.  What do you think?  I'm willing to implement a patch for whatever solution is suggested.\n",

      "body": "Here's a more concrete proposal:  We already have `fSyncStarted` in the node state of `main.cpp`.  This is set to true when we start requesting headers from a particular node, so we can use it to _not_ request headers from this node also following an inv message.  In addition, we have to reset the flag to false once we receive a headers message that does not have the maximum size - currently, it is never reset.\n\nAre there any problems with this approach or is it ok?  This is straight-forward to implement and fixes, as far as my preliminary testing goes, the issue.\n",

See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6755.\n\nWith this patch, the client tries to guess whether it is still in the initial headers sync and avoids starting the duplicate requests if it is.  I explained in comments in the code why this is safe.  Here's a summary:\n\nIn general, I tried to be \"conservative\" when deciding to prevent a request.  The node only thinks it is in the initial headers sync when it last received a `headers` message with full size (2,000 headers), building on top of its currently known best header, and at least 12 of the headers were previously unknown.  If an attacker wants to fake this condition to a node that is actually up-to-date (to prevent it from getting a newly announced block), he or she needs to construct 12 headers with valid PoW; this seems like a lot of effort for a not-so-critical effect.\n",

Should a peer respond with the first 2000 headers, Core will begin to download the headers chain from scratch, despite already having these. This is particularly strange while in parallel, the fresh peer may also be actively downloading blocks from the fully synced node.\n\nThis check is what causes it to redownload the chain: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L4434 I worry about this, since incoming peers can also trigger this - and only have to have the first 2000 headers for it to work. \n\nSo I'm wondering if there's a reason or if it's a bug. I thought `headers` messages started at the _next_ best header in the main chain? Can we simply disregard a `headers` message that doesn't start with an unknown header? \n",

When the headers arrive, the message will be of maximum size and so a follow-up request will be sent---all of that in addition to the existing headers syncing.  This will create a second \"chain\" of `getheaders` requests.  If more blocks arrive, this may even lead to arbitrarily many parallel chains of redundant requests.  (See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6755.)\n\nThis patch changes the behaviour to only request more headers after a maximum-sized message when it contained at least one unknown header.  This avoids sustaining parallel chains of redundant requests.\n\nNote that this patch avoids the issues raised in the discussion of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6821:  There is no risk of the node being permanently blocked.  At the latest when a new block arrives this will trigger a new getheaders request and restart syncing.\n",

          "title": "Backport \"assumed valid blocks\" feature from Bitcoin 0.13",
          "body": "This PR backports the \"assumed valid blocks\" feature from Bitcoin 0.13+ as already discussed in https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/backporting-bitcoin-0-13-performance-improvements.15612/\r\n\r\nThe PR includes multiple backported commits and 1 custom commit.\r\n\r\n**EDIT: As requested, I added original commit IDs to the description. Also, I added a few more commits as I realized that I should not have selected commits on naive commit level but on PR level. I reordered the commits based on PRs and marked the new commits with NEW**\r\n\r\nFrom original PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9053\r\n1. \"IBD check uses minimumchain work instead of checkpoints\" (original commit: fd46136dfaf68a7046cf7b8693824d73ac6b1caf)\r\nThis one introduced the nMinimumChainWork chainparam which is needed by the assumed valid blocks feature.\r\nI updated the nMinimumChainWork param for both the Dash mainnet and the testnet.\r\n2. **NEW** \"Remove GetTotalBlocksEstimate and checkpoint tests that test nothing.\" (original commit: 2082b5574cec783f4ff99941492d92e05680b293)\r\n3. **NEW** \"IsInitialBlockDownload no longer uses header-only timestamps.\" (original commit: e141beb6a9816b7e1e680fb0a8bae16d42a3e557)\r\n\r\nFrom original PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10345\r\n1. \"Delay parallel block download until chain has sufficient work\" (original commit: e2652002b6011f793185d473f87f1730c625593b)\r\nAs written in the forum post, I noticed that block headers and blocks are downloaded at the same time. When the node tries to figure out if an incoming block is an ancestor of the assumed valid block, it needs all the headers up until the assumed valid block. This means, it will always trigger full validation until the required headers are downloaded. As headers and blocks are downloaded at the same time, the headers download is slowed down quite a bit, so it's better to use full bandwidth for headers before we start the actual block download. This commits delays the block download.\r\n2. **NEW** Add timeout for headers sync (original commit: 76f74811c44b5119d5c19364b0594d423248ac0e)\r\n\r\nCustom commits:\r\n1. \"Add consensusParams to FindNextBlocksToDownload\"\r\nI had to add the consensusParams argument as it is not there yet due to other missing backports. This may result in minor conflicts later when other stuff is backported.\r\n\r\nFrom original PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9484\r\n1. \"Introduce assumevalid setting to skip presumed valid scripts.\" (original commit: e440ac7ef3b6f3ad1cd8fc7027cece40413202d9)\r\nThis is the actual feature being backported. It introduces the \"-assumevalid\" cli argument and the defaultAssumeValid chainparam. I've updated defaultAssumeValid for both the Dash mainnet and testnet.\r\n\r\n**EDIT: The above commits miss a new testcase being added in the original PR. I'm gonna handle this while fixing the other failing tests.** \r\n\r\nI would like to ask a few reviewers to verify the values used for nMinimumChainWork and defaultAssumeValid, to make sure I chose correct values. This can be done with your own full node and the debug console. I used block 721000 on mainnet and 251000 on testnet. To check if I used correct values, you could for example use the command \"getblockhash 721000\" and then \"getblock XXX\" with the result of getblockhash. getblock will also tell you the chainwork of that block.\r\n\r\nCurrently, it's hard to see the progress of the synchronization with this PR applied, as headers synching is not shown yet. It looks like nothing is happening for some time, until the actual block download starts. To see progress, it's needed to enter the debug console and use \"getblockchaininfo\", which will tell you how many headers are downloaded.\r\n\r\nThe current Bitcoin code already fixes this with some enhancements to the Qt wallet. The next step would be to backport some of these changes to enhance the user experience.\r\n",

Now that timeouts are implemented for headers sync, shouldn't your first PR be fine today?",

          "body": "Now that initial block download is delayed until the headers sync is done,\r\nit was noticed that the initial headers sync may happen multiple times in\r\nparallel in the case new blocks are announced. This happens because for\r\nevery block in INV that is received, a getheaders message is immediately\r\nsent out resulting in a full download of the headers chain starting from\r\nthe point of where the initial headers sync is currently at. This happens\r\nonce for each peer that announces the new block. This slows down the\r\ninitial headers sync and increases the chance of another block being\r\nannounced before it is finished, probably leading to the same behavior\r\nas already described, slowing down the sync even more...and so on.\r\n\r\nThis commit delays sending of GETHEADERS to later in case the chain is too\r\nfar behind while a new block gets announced. Header chains will still be\r\ndownloaded multiple times, but the downloading will start much closer\r\nto the tip of the chain, so the damage is not that bad anymore.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that we get all headers from all peers, even if any of them\r\nis on another chain. This should avoid what happened in\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8054\r\nwhich needed to be reverted later.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the Bitcoin issue https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6755",

          "body": "Zcashd will blindly request more block headers as long as it got 160\r\nblock headers in response to a previous query, EVEN IF THOSE HEADERS ARE\r\nALREADY KNOWN.  To dodge this behavior, return slightly fewer than the\r\nmaximum, to get it to go away.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/0ccc885371e01d844ebeced7babe45826623d9c2/src/main.cpp#L6274-L6280\r\n\r\nWithout this change, communication between a partially-synced `zebrad`\r\nand fully-synced `zcashd` looked like this:\r\n\r\n1.  `zebrad` connects to `zcashd`, which sends an initial `getheaders`\r\n    request;\r\n\r\n2.  `zebrad` correctly computes the intersection of the provided block\r\n    locator with the node's current chain and returns 160 following\r\n    headers;\r\n\r\n3.  `zcashd` does not check whether it already has those headers and\r\n    assumes that any provided headers are new and re-validates them;\r\n\r\n4.  `zcashd` assumes that because `zebrad` responded with 160 headers,\r\n    the `zebrad` node is ahead of it, and requests the next 160 headers.\r\n\r\n5.  Because block locators are sparse, the intersection between the\r\n    `zcashd` and `zebrad` chains is likely well behind the `zebrad` tip,\r\n    so this process continues for thousands of blocks.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this problem, we return slightly fewer than the protocol\r\nmaximum (158 rather than 160, to guard against off-by-one errors in\r\nzcashd).  This does not interfere with use of the returned headers by\r\npeers that check the headers, but does prevent `zcashd` from trying to\r\ndownload thousands of block headers it already has.\r\n\r\nThis problem does not occur in the `zcashd<->zcashd` case only because\r\n`zcashd` does not respond to `getheaders` messages while it is syncing.\r\nHowever, implementing this behavior in Zebra would be more complicated,\r\nbecause we don't have a distinct \"initial block sync\" state (we do\r\npoll-based syncing continuously) and we don't have shared global\r\nvariables to modify to set that state.\r\n\r\nRelevant links (thanks @str4d):\r\n\r\n- The PR that introduced this behavior: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4468/files#r17026905\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6861\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6755\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8306#issuecomment-614916454\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n**Current behavior:**\r\n\r\n1.14.x clients sometimes send many repeat requests for the same headers, which then get sent out to the peer but somehow ignored. This causes some clients to download multiple hundreds of GB of headers. Behavior is spotted 20-30 times per day across 15 of my 1.14.3 nodes.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": 255151,\r\n  \"addr\": \"xx.xxx.xxx.xx:36597\",\r\n  \"addrlocal\": \"xx.xx.xx.xx:22556\",\r\n  \"services\": \"0000000000000005\",\r\n  \"relaytxes\": true,\r\n  \"lastsend\": 1621427090,\r\n  \"lastrecv\": 1621427089,\r\n  \"bytessent\": 237311632324,\r\n  \"bytesrecv\": 206818992,\r\n  \"conntime\": 1621365890,\r\n  \"timeoffset\": 509,\r\n  \"pingtime\": 0.392223,\r\n  \"minping\": 0.258712,\r\n  \"pingwait\": 227.254694,\r\n  \"version\": 70015,\r\n  \"subver\": \"/Shibetoshi:1.14.3/\",\r\n  \"inbound\": true,\r\n  \"addnode\": false,\r\n  \"startingheight\": 21500,\r\n  \"banscore\": 0,\r\n  \"synced_headers\": -1,\r\n  \"synced_blocks\": -1,\r\n  \"inflight\": [],\r\n  \"whitelisted\": false,\r\n  \"bytessent_per_msg\": {\r\n    \"addr\": 59372,\r\n    \"block\": 425475202,\r\n    \"feefilter\": 32,\r\n    \"getheaders\": 1117,\r\n    \"headers\": 236884958826, <---- THIS\r\n    \"inv\": 1114301,\r\n    \"ping\": 11648,\r\n    \"pong\": 11616,\r\n    \"sendcmpct\": 33,\r\n    \"sendheaders\": 24,\r\n    \"verack\": 24,\r\n    \"version\": 129\r\n  },\r\n  \"bytesrecv_per_msg\": {\r\n    \"addr\": 36155,\r\n    \"feefilter\": 32,\r\n    \"getaddr\": 24,\r\n    \"getdata\": 968072,\r\n    \"getheaders\": 205791203, <---- THIS\r\n    \"ping\": 11648,\r\n    \"pong\": 11648,\r\n    \"sendcmpct\": 33,\r\n    \"sendheaders\": 24,\r\n    \"verack\": 24,\r\n    \"version\": 129\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nDon't send multiple requests for the same headers that often.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\nStart a fast node, check your peers from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Dogecoin Core version**\r\n\r\n1.14.3\r\n\r\n**Machine specs**\r\n- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\r\n- CPU: 4 vCores\r\n- RAM: 16Gb\r\n- Disk size: 200Gb\r\n- Disk Type (HD/SDD): SSD\r\n\r\n**Extra information**\r\n\r\n[debug.log with debug=net for affected peer](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/files/6535141/255151.txt.gz)\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "The problem with multiple getheaders with the same peer was recently fixed by #25454, so maybe this can be closed now?\r\n\r\nIt is still possible to do multiple getheaders with _different_ peers if a block is found during headerssync, and this is desirable to some degree (the original peer might be very slow or on an old chain), but the phenomenon where we'd start syncing headers with _all of our peers_ when a block is found will be mitigated by #25720 - but If I understand this issue correctly, it's not really about that anyway.",
