      "body": "The search is  being done for every received transaction, even when code unconditionally won't reject it due to the protocol versions.  This could be very simply avoided by moving the \"!pfrom.HasPermission(NetPermissionFlags::Relay) && pfrom.GetCommonVersion() >= REJECT_UNSOLICITED_TX_VERSION\" test up to surround the expected.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the search could also be gated on NET LOGGING enabled (e.g. net logging || (version && no permission)), and then it could log the unexpected TXN even if it will not ignore it (the disposition could be in the log message).   This would make it easier to monitor the behavior (when I used to monitor for this I carried a local patch).\r\n\r\nGiven that the check now only applies to a newer protocol version could it be made to disconnect the peer?  This may cause a more rapid discovery of bugs in users code since being disconnected is much more obvious than having the txn silently dropped.\r\n\r\nI'm somewhat dubious of the value of this behind a version check:  the abusive hosts that intentionally do this will just continue to be an older version and I don't think it's realistic to cut off older versions completely.   But I think this PR is vastly superior to doing nothing, and perhaps once the new behavior is widely deployed the test could be extended to older versions (presumably in ignore rather than disconnect form, if this is changed to disconnect).\r\n",

      "body": "Having gone and looked at the old discussion, I see some skepticism for the value of this and I don't see anyone pointing out the reason I think it's important.\r\n\r\nAt times there have been parties that mass connect to every node on the network and blast them with transactions, presumably in an effort to make sure the transactions get propagated and accepted.  This is abusive particularly because it wastes bandwidth when it gives nodes transactions they already know or have already requested from someone else.  It's also abusive because it wastes connection slots... a mass connector uses thousands of times the slot capacity of an ordinary nodes.   If the conduct doesn't work (or just gets the peer disconnected) then it will be of no value and will likely stop (or not be started again in the future, if it's not happening right now).\r\n\r\nThe same issue also previously existed for full blocks with some misguided miners blindly spamming every node they could connect with a full block every time they solved one, effectively DOSing the whole network (and probably working contrary to their intent).  The best and often only way to correct conduct like this is to just make it not even conjecturally provide a benefit. \r\n\r\nPerhaps one way to hasten the deployment is to enforce this on P2Pv2 connections immediately in addition to or instead of the protocol version check,  custom announcement code isn't likely to use v2 yet.  As far as I know all widely deployed software already does the right thing.  \r\n",

This is distinct from limiting CPU DoS (whatever the DoS margin already existent from MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENT at full steam, reducing that maximum number is irrelevant if you can bypass it with unsolicited txn) and other p2p DoS.\r\n\r\nPushed a new commit to discourage and disconnect upgraded peers (>= REJECT_UNSOLICITED_TX_VERSION), though non upgraded peers are non affected. There is still the risk to be over strict with deployed softwares not doing the right things, i.e there is a lot of weird behaviors in other p2p bitcoin stacks, breaking the tx broadcast of some obscure lightning wallet ain’t a small bug. On the other hand, being liberal with non upgraded peers all the DoS vectors can be still be abused. A better approach could be to revert ae60d485, i.e gradual increase of the discouragement score were non upgraded peers would be allow a number of score points before to be disconnected (e.g for each unsolicited tx 10 discouragement score points bump).\r\n\r\nW.r.t “private broadcast” mode, I think it’s better to have it fixed to follow the INV / GETDATA / TX flow, otherwise it sounds a loophole for an attacker to trigger DoS / connection slots mass waste if “private peers” are not punished for unsolicited traffic. It’s better to do it now, rather to introduce a node fingerprint between hypothetical version of “private broadcast” mode.",

      "body": "> gradual increase of the discouragement score were non upgraded peers would be allow a number of score points before to be disconnected\r\n\r\nThat's like not-found, -- an idea that sounds attractive on it's face but on examination causes problems.  For behavior that can't be prevented (like, say, inv-ing a transaction to you that already know), then it should obviously never disconnect for that.  For behavior that can be prevented like sending a txn before an inv, sending an invalid block, etc.., peers are either compatible or they're not.   If they're not you want them disconnected ASAP so they can each replace the connection with a compatible peer, and if one is buggy you want the operator finding out ASAP too, ideally as soon as they deploy the buggy code.   letting something rack up a dos score hides the issue temporarily but then under different transaction load its suddenly getting disconnected, but since nothing changed for the user they may not be paying much attention.\r\n\r\nIs anyone running this currently with the code set to always enforce or just log? it would be useful to know at what rate nodes are currently seeing unsolicited.  In the past, I'd see waves of them... months with absolutely none and then periods where a single IP was mass connecting the whole network and bursting them out.  I don't think I ever observed any widely deployed software doing this, though it easily could have changed.   I'm particularly interested if any protocol v2 nodes engage in it, since I think that's a viable way to immediately enforce without breaking anything.\r\n",

However, it is experimental, only works for outbound connections, requires the light client to be patched right now (and may have other design issues). Just wanted to mention it for context, because a legacy light client behind a BIP324 proxy will likely not be visible on the network today, but theoretically, it may be in the future. In any case, it seems reasonable to assume anyone opting to run the proxy first made sure that their software does not send unrequested transactions. (If they didn't, they'll hopefully notice the relay issue quickly)",

      "body": "This PR exposes that nodes are currently making duplicate transaction requests not too infrequently.  ::facepalm::  What happens is that when Peer1 announces {parent,child} and Peer2 announces {parent,child} and we request parent from 1 and child from 2, but 2 responds faster, then orphan handling will request parent by txid from 2.  Then it gets the parent by txid from 2. Then when peer 1 replies to the request for parent (sending a duplicate transaction), the current behavior of this PR falsely thinks that was an unrequested txn because its tracking was removed after the transaction was from peer 2 was accepted.\r\n\r\nFor this PR it's probably just best to silently ignore AlreadyHave transactions (more precise handling of things that are requested but outstanding would be more correct but requires care in memory management), but the duplicate requests should separately get fixed.  At first blush it seems hard to fix them completely but they could be made less common by significantly delaying the requests made on behalf of the orphan resolution, so they get satisfied by the already in flight request for the same txn by wtxid when it comes in... which should almost always be the case outside of a recent startup except when the parent was never offered because it was below the nodes fee filter.",

This PR addresses just that by introducing a new protocol version. It does not address the other concerns.\r\n\r\nOn the new protocol idea - we don't expect that an attacker will voluntarily switch to the new protocol so that their attack can be thwarted, right? If this PR is merged and at some point in the future, we drop unsolicited transactions from old peers, then that is the same as going back to #21224, without this PR because that would break existent tools.\r\n\r\nThe OP mentions \"undocumented clients\" and in the discussions there seems to creep the idea that sending unsolicited transactions is a [violation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30572#issuecomment-2267358845) of the protocol, undocumented behavior, an error or wrong in some way without providing any reference to back those claims. On the contrary, the oppotite seems to be the case: sending unsolicited transactions is [explicitly documented](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/p2p_networking.html#tx) and even if it was not, in the absence of documentation then the source code is the spec and Bitcoin Core accepts unsolicited transactions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I am wrong but even if this is implemented, an attacker can send up to 5000 (`MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS`) announcements to which the victim will respond (after a few seconds) by requesting 5000 transactions at once. If one transaction takes 1 second to reject, then the attack is successful. The motivation behind `MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS` is to limit the amount of memory used for announcements. I guess it is too high to stop CPU DoS with slow-to-reject transactions... this is already repeating the arguments from #21224.\r\n\r\nIn summary, requiring `INV+GETDATA` does not solve the problem and breaks existent tools.\r\nConcept NACK because of this.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to throttle the processing of newly arrived transactions, globally and/or per-peer, regardless of whether they are solicited or unsolicited.",

One way to do so is to phase in changes so that older software has an opportunity to fix itself, and once the fixed behavior is ubiquitous then the compatibility issue no longer exists.  But if you over narrowly analyze the first step in such a transition you might mistakenly argue that it was pointless because the old behavior still exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Was it unclear?\r\n\r\nYou mean this one: \"At times there have been parties that mass connect...\"? If that would be the driving force behind this, then maybe it would be better to put it in the PR description.\r\n\r\nSo this is not about CPU DoS attack by slow-invalid transactions, but about somebody doing something stupid and using the Bitcoin network in an ineffective way, sending 500 bytes instead of 30? Requiring `INV+GETDATA` will probably stop this, but is it such a problem to be worth the effort? How often does it happen? Is it something that happened once 7 years ago, or is it happening regularly, e.g. every week? What % of the entire network traffic is wasted due to that per month?\r\n\r\nYou also mentioned wasting inbound slots, but requiring `INV+GETDATA` will not solve that - the mass connect tool will be updated to do `INV+GETDATA+TX` instead of just `TX`. Those are short-lived connections anyway.\r\n\r\n> fixing bugs requires fixing bugs in other software\r\n\r\nI do not think that sending or accepting unsolicited transactions is a bug - it is documented, has been working like this forever and the network is just fine with it.",

For behavior that can't be prevented (like, say, inv-ing a transaction to you that already know), then it should obviously never disconnect for that. For behavior that can be prevented like sending a txn before an inv, sending an invalid block, etc.., peers are either compatible or they're not. If they're not you want them disconnected ASAP so they can each replace the connection with a compatible peer, and if one is buggy you want the operator finding out ASAP too, ideally as soon as they deploy the buggy code. letting something rack up a dos score hides the issue temporarily but then under different transaction load its suddenly getting disconnected, but since nothing changed for the user they may not be paying much attention.\r\n\r\nSurely, in the ideal you would like your whole set of inbound / outbound peers to be fully composed of non-buggy\r\npeers, respecting behaviors like sending a txn before an inv or not sending an invalid block. In practice, a\r\nfull-node is a network-exposed daemon, so it's good to accomodate a wide variety of network peers to allow to\r\nroll out multiple versions of the protocol at the same time. On the internet, it's not like we have 2 versions\r\nof the IP protocol used in production...\r\n\r\nOn the silent rack up you're describing, this can be indeed an issue as suddenly you're getting a buggy peer\r\ndisconnected, while this connection slot could have been used for a reliable peer. I believe it's more making\r\nthe point that bad discouragement dos score could be encompassed in the automated inbound slot eviction heuristics.\r\n\r\n> Is anyone running this currently with the code set to always enforce or just log? it would be useful to know at what\r\n> rate nodes are currently seeing unsolicited. In the past, I'd see waves of them... months with absolutely none and\r\n> then periods where a single IP was mass connecting the whole network and bursting them out. I don't think I ever observed\r\n> any widely deployed software doing this, though it easily could have changed. I'm particularly interested if any protocol\r\n> v2 nodes engage in it, since I think that's a viable way to immediately enforce without breaking anything.\r\n\r\nNo, I've not been running a full-node with the old patch to monitor unsolicited transactions. As you're pointing\r\nout whatever buggy lightweight clients doing that behavior, there is still the situation of a single IP mass connecting\r\nthe whole network, and potentially doing so for deanonymization purposes.\r\n\r\nIn any way, as you're suggesting I think too upgrading to a protocol v2 like `TX_PROTOCOL_V2` can be a practical way to\r\nintroduce this more restrictive behavior on inv-txn flow. So far other examples of p2p behavior deprecation have\r\nbeen things like NODE_BLOOM version bits.\r\n\r\n@maflcko\r\n\r\n> Just for context, there is an idea for a \"BIP324 proxy\" for legacy light clients: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/bip324-proxy-easy-integration-of-v2-transport-protocol-for-light-clients-poc/678 . However, it is experimental, only works for outbound connections, requires the light client to be patched right now (and may have other design issues). Just wanted to mention it for context, because a legacy light client behind a BIP324 proxy will likely not be visible on the network today, but theoretically, it may be in the future. In any case, it seems reasonable to assume anyone opting to run the proxy first made sure that their software does not send unrequested transactions. (If they didn't, they'll hopefully notice the relay issue quickly)\r\n\r\nYes, I think that means if the bip324 proxy got more used by legacy light clients, version agent and protocol\r\nspoken it is harder to rely on to monitor solely on the legacy clients characteristics.\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell\r\n\r\n> This PR exposes that nodes are currently making duplicate transaction requests not too infrequently. ::facepalm:: \r\n> What happens is that when Peer1 announces {parent,child} and Peer2 announces {parent,child} and we request parent from 1 and child from 2, but 2 responds faster, then orphan handling will request parent by txid from 2. Then it gets > the parent by txid from 2. Then when peer 1 replies to the request for parent (sending a duplicate transaction), the current behavior of this PR falsely thinks that was an unrequested txn because its tracking was removed after the t> ransaction was from peer 2 was accepted.\r\n\r\nOf course, orphaness is terrible for this type of restrictiosn on the inv-tx flow, I already pointed\r\nout so in my original PR.\r\n\r\n\"I think we have a fundemental issue with orphans processing. Orphanness source isn't strictly\r\nassignable. I.e, Mallory might provoke mempool conflicts between Alice and Bob, sending Y to Alice,\r\nY' to Bob. From then, Mallory can send a set of Y childrens to Alice, she will accept them and\r\nrelay forward to Bob. Alice will be the one swalloing the DoS penalty. And now you have a vector\r\nof tx-relay jamming...\"\r\n\r\n> For this PR it's probably just best to silently ignore AlreadyHave transactions (more precise handling of\r\n> things that are requested but outstanding would be more correct but requires care in memory management), but\r\n> the duplicate requests should separately get fixed. At first blush it seems hard to fix them completely but\r\n> they could be made less common by significantly delaying the requests made on behalf of the orphan resolution,\r\n> so they get satisfied by the already in flight request for the same txn by wtxid when it comes in... which\r\n> should almost always be the case outside of a recent startup except when the parent was never offered because\r\n> it was below the nodes fee filter.\r\n\r\nThe `AlreadyHave` can be a good idea, but I think now you're introducing a bandwidth free relay vector at last,\r\nwhere a single parent can be concurrently replayed through many transaction-relay links. I'm not sure either \r\ndelayed orphan resolution is necessarily a working way as now you can have slow propagation of pre-signed low-fees\r\ntransactions that are only interesting with high-fee child. And it's the simple chain of transactions situations,\r\nyou can have a same child txid, different wtxid / different feerates rebinding on the same parent...\r\n\r\n@mzumsande \r\n\r\n> 1.) orphan X is received, put into orphanage, parent P requested\r\n> 2.) a child Y of X is received -> It's also an orphan, parent X is requested again (by txid!) because AlreadyHaveTx does not check the orphanage by txid (reason)\r\n> 3.) P is received and accepted\r\n> 4.) orphan resolution accepts X, removes the tx request for X (in ProcessValidTx()) even though there is an outstanding request\r\n> 5.) X is received again, it's seen as unrequested. The peer would be disconnected even though it did nothing wrong.\r\n\r\nIf I'm understanding correctly, you're pointing to sequential orphan resolution of a chain of transaction\r\nP <- X <- Y, yes I think you could have X the intermediary transaction element seen as unrequested. See\r\nmy point above to gmaxwell, as I think the AlreadyHave presents already issues with adding a free relay vector on\r\nsimple 2-depth chain of transactions.\r\n\r\n@vasild\r\n\r\n> #21224 was frowned upon for a few reasons and one of them was breaking existent tools. This PR addresses just that by introducing a new protocol version. It does not address the other concerns.\r\n\r\nAddressing _all_ the other concerns mentioned in the old PR means purely re-writing the ~10k of LoC of the\r\ntransaction-relay stack from scratch in cpp or rust...It's an interesting exercise and certainly one that\r\nsomeone could actually do so thanks to the multiprocess interfaces, _but_ in the meantime it will leave\r\nforever exposed current bitcoin core full-nodes to DoS vectors arising from hard to verify transactions.\r\n\r\n> On the new protocol idea - we don't expect that an attacker will voluntarily switch to the new protocol so that their\r\n> attack can be thwarted, right? If this PR is merged and at some point in the future, we drop unsolicited transactions\r\n> from old peers, then that is the same as going back to #21224, without this PR because that would break existent tools.\r\n\r\nOf course we don't live in the world of Care Bears so we cannot expect attackers running potentially modified\r\nsoftware to adhere to the new protocol, period. Though here you're missing all the salt of the past conversations\r\non the old PR, where there is a trade-off between breaking either existent tools or letting exposed current\r\nnodes.\r\n\r\n> The OP mentions \"undocumented clients\" and in the discussions there seems to creep the idea that sending unsolicited\r\n> transactions is a violation of the protocol, undocumented behavior, an error or wrong in some way without providing\r\n> any reference to back those claims. On the contrary, the oppotite seems to be the case: sending unsolicited transactions\r\n> is explicitly documented and even if it was not, in the absence of documentation then the source code is the spec and\r\n> Bitcoin Core accepts unsolicited transactions.\r\n\r\nThere is no BIP standard documenting this behavior about transaction-relay and there is no guarantee that other full-nodes\r\nsoftwares are respecting the non-reject of unsolicited transactions. In the absence of documentation, it's indeed wise to\r\nrefer to the code, though in matters of transaction-relay messages usually it has been something fleshout from iterations\r\nbetween full-nodes softwares and application clients (e.g the MEMPOOL message), and this I think since the early days of\r\nlightweight clients deployment in bitcoin circa ~2011.\r\n\r\n> Correct me if I am wrong but even if this is implemented, an attacker can send up to 5000 (MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS) announcements\r\n> to which the victim will respond (after a few seconds) by requesting 5000 transactions at once. If one transaction takes 1 second to\r\n> reject, then the attack is successful. The motivation behind MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS is to limit the amount of memory used for\r\n> announcements. I guess it is too high to stop CPU DoS with slow-to-reject transactions... this is already repeating the arguments from #21224.\r\n\r\nThis is correct that the current value of 5000 (`MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS`) can still leave some DOS exposure,\r\nand that reducing it could be considered in future PRs, however without that initial step of rejecting the unsolicited\r\ntransactions over the `MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS` limit, this is quite useless to consider at first the default\r\nvalue of `MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS`.\r\n\r\n> In summary, requiring INV+GETDATA does not solve the problem and breaks existent tools.\r\n> Concept NACK because of this.\r\n> \r\n> It would be better to throttle the processing of newly arrived transactions, globally and/or per-peer, regardless of whether they are solicited or unsolicited.\r\n\r\nRandomly throttling the processing of newly arrived solicited and unsolicited transactions could make the\r\nmitigation worst than the DoS exposure reduction, as this could a transaction propagation censorship vector.\r\n\r\n> You mean this one: \"At times there have been parties that mass connect...\"? If that would be the driving force behind this, \r\n> then maybe it would be better to put it in the PR description.\r\n\r\nGenerally, this is not the job of bitcoin core contributors to write a full description on how transactions relay behaviors\r\ncould be used by incompetent chainalysis companies to conduct deanonymization attacks on the network...\r\n\r\n> So this is not about CPU DoS attack by slow-invalid transactions, but about somebody doing something stupid and using the\r\n> Bitcoin network in an ineffective way, sending 500 bytes instead of 30? Requiring INV+GETDATA will probably stop this, but\r\n> is it such a problem to be worth the effort? How often does it happen? Is it something that happened once 7 years ago, or is\r\n> it happening regularly, e.g. every week? What % of the entire network traffic is wasted due to that per month?\r\n\r\nLeveling up the bar w.r.t to potential deanonymization is one concern. A full-node being feeded unsolicited hard to\r\nverify transactions that could be DoSy can be another concern.\r\n\r\n> You also mentioned wasting inbound slots, but requiring INV+GETDATA will not solve that - the mass connect tool will be\r\n> updated to do INV+GETDATA+TX instead of just TX. Those are short-lived connections anyway.\r\n\r\nA mass connect tool might not open short-lived connections, all depends the purpose of the tool.\r\n\r\n> I do not think that sending or accepting unsolicited transactions is a bug - it is documented, has been working like this\r\n> forever and the network is just fine with it.\r\n\r\nNot really, there is no such documentation about unsolicited transaction in the codebase at commit 4405b78d, and times have proven this version of the software had significant and major bugs such as BIP30.\r\n\r\n@ajtowns\r\n\r\n> Sending INV and waiting for a GETDATA does mitigate the bandwidth involved substantially: when the txs are duplicates, you're now\r\n> only receiving the w/txid instead of the full transaction, reducing the wasted bandwidth by perhaps a factor of at least ~4x (32B \r\n> vs ~128B for parent txid/sig/output), and probably substantially more. I think the inbound slots issue>  is just \"if we know we don't\r\n> want this peer, lets discourage immediately so the slot is free\", so an optimisation rather than addressing a DoS concern per se.\r\n\r\nAbout the inbound slots issue, see one of the comment of gmaxwell above, I think there is an argument about the robustness of your local transaction-relay topology by not dropping misbehaving peers at first protocol violation. IMHO, I think this can be improved by adding a discouragement score, or whatever other marker as inbound peers eviction heuristics.\r\n\r\n@vasild\r\n\r\n> Another aspect to consider wrt wasting bandwidth: if the sender knows the recipient does not have the transaction (e.g. when a wallet sends\r\n> its newly created transaction), then doing the extra INV+GETDATA round-trip is a waste.\r\n\r\nThe sender can never be sure that the recipient already have the transaction, recipient full-node could have shutdown and reboot or the transaction could have temporarily fallen under the mempool min fee at the TX message reception.",
