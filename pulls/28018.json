Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review.

Not exactly sure where would be the best spot.\r\n\r\nAlso another thing I wanted to clarify is that will `-torcontrol` always be in the format of `host:port` or is there ever a chance of being abe to just provide one or the other? because then we can try splitting and validating each part individually",

However, it does align with many of our other options to have a default port, and if that makes sense here too then the help  for `torcontrol` arg should be updated to show port as optional as a first step.\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, even \"1\" is a valid value (it would be the same as 0.0.0.1:9051), though I suppose it wouldn't hurt to check for it specifically and reject it.\r\n\r\nWhilst this is technically true for low-level networking (code), IMO it's extremely un-common to **not** require users to use dot-decimal notation for hosts, and I think we should reject non dot-decimal hosts to prevent exactly the issue in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23589.
