    "title": "tracing: tests for USDT tracepoints ",
    "body": "#22006 added the first three USDT based tracepoints to Bitcoin Core. To provide a [semi-stable](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#semi-stable-api) tracepoint API the tracepoints need test coverage. The tracepoints can be tested in the functional tests using the Python wrapper of [BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc). \r\n\r\nBefore adding more tracepoints, the existing three tracepoints from #22006 should be tested.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1. We currently only support the tracepoints on Linux. The tests should be skipped on other operating systems.\r\n2. Hooking into the tracepoints via the Linux kernel requires special privileges. Since kernel version 5.8. (Aug. 2020) the `CAP_BPF` can be used. On older kernel version the overloaded catch-all capability `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is required. Functional tests shouldn't require `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` as that essentially means running the test suite with `root` privileges.  \r\n3. The tests require the BCC Python library. This should be an optional dependency. Tests should be skipped if the dependency isn't present. \r\n\r\nThe `connect_block` tracepoint can be tested by mining blocks with transactions and checking that the tracepoint passes the correct data. The `net` `inbound_message` and `outbound_message` tracepoints can be tested by checking the traffic between two nodes. \r\n",

          "body": "There has been light conceptual agreement on including the Userspace, Statically Defined Tracing tracepoints in Bitcoin Core release builds. This, for example, enables user to hook into production deployments, if they need to. Binaries don't have to be switched out. This is possible because we don't do [expensive computations](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#no-expensive-computations-for-tracepoints) only needed for the tracepoints. The tracepoints are NOPs when not used.\r\n\r\nSystemtap's `sys/sdt.h` header is required to build Bitcoin Core with USDT support. The header file defines the `DTRACE_PROBE` macros used in [`src/util/trace.h`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/util/trace.h). This PR adds Systemtap 4.5 (May 2021) as dependency. GUIX builds for Linux hosts now include the tracepoints.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23297.",

      "body": "I've focused on getting a proof-of-concept (PoC) running on CirrussCI for now. I solved a few of the bigger issues, but I'm at a point where I think the CI containers don't have enough permissions to attach to the USDT tracepoints. I've learned a bit about the CI and want to document my process here for future re-attempts.\r\n\r\nMy PoC branch is https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin/commits/2022-01-tracepoint-ci-poc\r\n\r\n**tl;dr:** I think we are not able to set the required Linux capabilities to test USDT tracepoints on CirrusCi: `Unable to set capabilities [--caps=CAP_SYS_ADMIN+ep]`.\r\n\r\nfirst commit: My approach for the PoC was to drop all tasks besides the `[lint]` task for less CI load. No need to re-test the same Bitcoin Core code over and over. I've then added a CI task specifically for the USDT tracing tests, disabling e.g. the unit tests and existing functional tests for faster CI feedback. I checked that the newly added CI task builds the (or uses the cached) depends including the systemtap depends added in #23724 and that `use usdt` is `true` the configure stage.\r\n\r\nsecond commit: The next step was to set the prerequisites for the USDT functional tests up. This test should only be run when a) the tracepoints are compiled and b) the Python `bcc` ([iovisor/bcc](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc)) is installed. I've added the relevant checks to `test_framework.py` and a  `ENABLE_USDT_TRACEPOINTS` flag in the `config.ini.in`. Additionally, I've added `bpfcc-tools` to the installed packages for the `bcc` Python package.\r\n\r\nthird commit: Then, I've added an `interface_usdt.py` PoC functional test based on the [`log_raw_p2p_msgs.py`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/tracing/log_raw_p2p_msgs.py) example. It checks that at least one inbound and one outbound P2P message is received over the USDT interface.\r\n\r\nfourth commit: The BPF bytecode compilation from the provided C code failed. The kernel headers are missing. It took me a while to remember that containers use the host's kernel. This means the relevant kernel headers can't be found/installed in the Ubuntu jammy container. According to the [Cirrus CI documentation](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/linux/), the `container` instances run on a GKE cluster of compute-optimized instances running in Google Cloud. These run Google's [Container-Optimized OS](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/concepts/features-and-benefits) COS with their own kernel. Specifically, (I think) the [`cos-89-16108-534-8`](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes/m89#cos-89-16108-534-8) release with the `COS-5.4.144` Linux kernel. It's possible to retrieve the kernel source and run the `make oldconfig` and `make prepare` steps using the kernel configuration in `/proc/config.gz`. This is, for example, done in `iovisor/kubectl-trace` (Kubernetes tracing) for COS too. See [`fetch-linux-headers.sh`](iovisor/kubectl-trace/blob/master/build/init/fetch-linux-headers.sh). Fetching the kernel headers and the `make` steps take a few minutes. However I think this could be cached and only needs to be done one time when Cirrus CI upgrades their host OS to a newer version. We need to set the `BCC_KERNEL_SOURCE` env var to the generated kernel headers. The BPF bytecode compilation succeeds now. \r\n\r\nfifth commit: We lack the required permissions to open the BPF maps. I assumed this could be solved by adding the required capabilities (to docker). It wasn't clear to me that `DOCKER_EXEC` does, in fact, not run `docker exec <args>`. The CI is run in the CirrusCI container itself at the moment. See `DANGER_RUN_CI_ON_HOST`. (Maybe just `EXEC` would be a better name). So adding `--cap-add=CAP_X` to `DOCKER_ADMIN` (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23296#issuecomment-997217488) did not work. I've opted to use `capsh` to set the required capabilities. With the host's 5.4 Linux kernel, we can't use `CAP_BPF` and `CAP_PERFMON` as they were introduced in 5.8. We have to fall back to `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. However, this fails with `Unable to set capabilities [--caps=CAP_SYS_ADMIN+ep]`. Later, I discovered https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-ci-docs/issues/654, where MarcoFalke already asked about this for `wine`.\r\n\r\nHere's the failed CI task: https://cirrus-ci.com/task/6305351615119360\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMaybe @MarcoFalke has further ideas? Or @laanwj? I think having automatically run tests for the tracepoints is important. I don't think running these on a different CI is a good solution though.\r\n\r\nI'll be focusing on a PoC for local development machines for now. It should be possible to run these with `sudo capsh ...`, dropping privilege while only keeping the required capabilities. While these functional tests would be skipped on most development machines, they could at least be run to e.g. test release candidates and on PRs adding new tracepoints (with tests).\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "This adds functional tests for the USDT tracepoints added in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22006 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22902. This partially fixes #23296. The tests **are probably skipped** on most systems as these tests require:\r\n- a Linux system with a kernel that supports BPF (and available kernel headers)\r\n- that Bitcoin Core is compiled with tracepoints for USDT support (default when compiled with depends)\r\n- [bcc](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) installed\r\n- the tests are run with a privileged user that is able to e.g. do BPF syscalls and load BPF maps\r\n\r\nThe tests are not yet run in our CI as the CirrusCI containers lack the required permissions (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23296#issuecomment-1024920845). Running the tests in a VM in the CI could work, but I haven't experimented with this yet. The priority was to get the actual tests done first to ensure the tracepoints work as intended for the v23.0 release. Running the tracepoint tests in the CI is planned as the next step to finish #23296.\r\n\r\nThe tests can, however, be run against e.g. release candidates by hand. Additionally, they provide a starting point for tests for future tracepoints. PRs adding new tracepoint should include tests. This makes reviewing these PRs easier.\r\n\r\nThe tests require privileges to execute BPF sycalls (`CAP_SYS_ADMIN` before Linux kernel 5.8 and `CAP_BPF` and `CAP_PERFMON` on 5.8+) and permissions to `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/`. It's currently recommended to run the tests in a virtual machine (or on a VPS) where it's sensible to use the `root` user to gain these privileges. Never run python scripts you haven't carefully reviewed with `root` permissions! It's unclear if a non-root user can even gain the required privileges. This needs more experimenting.\r\n\r\nThe goal here is to test the tracepoint interface to make sure the [documented interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#tracepoint-documentation) does not break by accident. The tracepoints expose implementation details. This means we also need to rely on implementation details of Bitcoin Core in these functional tests to trigger the tracepoints. An example is the test of the `utxocache:flush` tracepoint: On Bitcoin Core shutdown, the UTXO cache is flushed twice. The corresponding tracepoint test expects two flushes, too - if not, the test fails. Changing implementation details could cause these tests to fail and the tracepoint API to break. However, we purposefully treat the tracepoints only as [**semi-stable**](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#semi-stable-api). The tracepoints should not block refactors or changes to other internals.\r\n",

          "body": "Changes a CI task that runs test the previously not run `test/functional/interface_usdt_*.py` functional tests (added in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24358). \r\n\r\nThis task is run as CirussCI `compute_engine_instance` VM as hooking into the tracepoints is not possible in CirrusCI docker containers (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23296#issuecomment-1024920845). We use an unoffical PPA and untrusted  `bpfcc-tools` package in the CI as the Ubuntu jammy and Debian bullseye packages are outdated. We hope use an official package when new Ubuntu/Debian releases are available for the use with Google Compute Engine.\r\n\r\nWe make sure to hook into `bitcoind` binaries in USDT interface tests via their PID, instead of their path. This makes sure multiple functional tests running in parallel don't interfere with each other.\r\n\r\nThe utxocache USDT interface tests is adopted to a change of the functional test framework that wasn't detected as the tests weren't run in the CI. As the tracepoints expose internals, it can happen that we need to adopt the interface test when internals change. This is a bit awkward, and if it happens to frequently, we should consider generalizing the tests a bit more. For now it's fine, I think.\r\n\r\nSee the individual commit messages for more details on the changes.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24782\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23296\r\n\r\nI'd like to hear from reviewers:\r\n- Are we OK with using the [`hadret/bpfcc`](https://launchpad.net/~hadret/+archive/ubuntu/bpfcc) PPA for now? There is a clear plan when to drop it and as is currently, it could only impact the newly added VM task. \r\n- ~~Adding a new task increases CI runtime and costs. Should an existing `container` CI task be ported to a VM and reused instead?~~ Yes, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25528#issuecomment-1179509525 ",
