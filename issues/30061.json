    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nI installed bitcoin core 26.1 on a Raspberry 5 (ARM Architecture) running Ubuntu 23.1. Upon running bitcoin-qt, I got the error that the library libxcb-xinerama0 is required but not installed.\r\n\r\nIt's easily fixed by installing it from the repositories (apt install libxcb-xinerama0), however, for a security conscious person this is a bit unsatisfying. Is there a reason this library is not packaged with the bitcoin core binaries?\r\n\r\nAfter all you go through the hassle of verifying and cross checking all signatures of the binaries and then you have to install a third party untrusted library to run everything.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nBitcoin core comes packaged with all required libraries.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nSee current behavior.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPre-built binaries\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\n26.1\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 23.1 \n\n### Machine specifications\n\nRaspberry 5 ARM",
