    "title": "Switch to CMake (was: Native build on Windows using Clang)",
    "body": "Bitcoin Core can be built on Windows using Clang natively. Currently only a few projects are using this (Chrome [since march](http://blog.llvm.org/2018/03/clang-is-now-used-to-build-chrome-for.html), Firefox [since yesterday](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17504197)). It'd make building for Window easier. Moreover, I'm sure that it's easier to use than MSYS + MinGW.\r\n\r\nThere's only one obstacle:\r\n\r\n- Autotools does not run on Windows!\r\n\r\nWhat are your opinions on creating a Cmake file? Although the `configure.ac` is not-so-tiny, the review community is really active here. If I get positive feedback about it, I'd be glad to create the first draft of it. In addition, Cmake files are used more often. Wouldn't it be great to give the option for builders to choose between autotools and Cmake?",

I don't know much\nabout build systems, so maybe I'm overestimating this, but does this mean\nwe also need to cmakeify libsecp256k1 and libunivalue? Does the depends\nbuild need to be modified as well, or can we keep that make based? Do we\nneed to find alternatives to the make based tricks used to run the unit\ntests in parallel? I'm just concerned that people suggesting moving from\none setup to another underestimate the work that went into our current\nbuild infrastructure.\n\n>\n",

We need to be able to cross compile binaries for all targets that we do binary releases for from a linux build system due to gitian. For developers on Windows we do have [msvc build](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/build_msvc) support already.\r\n\r\nOne issue with cmake is that it's a makefile generator while autoconf is a configure script generator, the configure script created by autoconf is designed to be portable, there isn't really a direct equivalent with cmake AFAIK. In general autoconf projects are considered easier to work with for people packaging software even though the build system may be somewhat more complex to maintain.",

          "body": "Goals with this PR:\r\n\r\n1. We should use the dependency versions published by bitcoin. Exceptions include boost::locale fixes, the clang compiler for OSX (to use newer C++), and any security fixes we're aware of (none).\r\n2. We should use \"depends\" for our official Linux, Windows, and OSX builds so that they all have the same dependencies.\r\n3. The name \"reproducible\" needs to go away, as that's a misnomer. However, we should provide docker images for a nearly-reproducible experience (and use them on the build server).\r\n4. Compiling the traditional way (./configure ...) should work; our scripts shouldn't be required.\r\n5. Ensure that the Travis caching doesn't have unintended side effects.\r\n\r\nFor reviewing this, first check which files match bitcoin v17. That will eliminate the need for reviewing the majority of the files.",

Most of the discussion is about switching the current msvc build (which is for developer convenience only and never used to build official binaries) to cmake. That would be possibly be a minor improvement to the current msvc build config and Visual Studio does now have [cmake support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019). Without a PR, even it was for only one of the libraries, this issue is a bit academic.",

          "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\n#### New Developers unable to quickly get up and going in their IDE\r\n\r\nThe current  build system is very brittle and the custom tailored nature of  it leaves the development team having to address constant breaking changes and new architectures etc. It also leaves new comers to the project in a state of despair when they realize that the current IDE cannot pick up the project. \r\n\r\nFor example in this issue #13694 , the user asked \"where I could find the guide on how to install an IDE and debug the code?\" because his top of the line IDE, CLion works by using CMake. The other well known C/C++ IDEs that are currently used are able to and appear to prefer the CMake build system. Sadly, the sarcastic response (i hope) from @sipa was \"Most developers don't use IDEs as far as I know\".\r\n\r\nFor the Windows users out there, in issue #14118 , the issue got alot of support to the idea of adding CMake, as one is able to quickly work on C/C++ projects given Visual Studio's and VSCode support for CMake projects.\r\n\r\n#### Improve ecosystem by having option to build shared libraries\r\n\r\nThis last point will be a simple theory, but if CMake is added, one could imagine that the ecosystem to grow and flourish and bring in new support and tooling with it. For instance, if i wanted to instead wrap around the C++ code using CFFI and call directly from Python/JS/Whatever I am unable to as where would I even begin to get started on compiling a library as opposed to the executable in a neat manner? Right now the best way to interact with bitcoin is via the rpc it seems, but why not directly ?\r\n\r\nThe other direct benefits of having a \"simple\" CMake build system is we can undo the tight coupling of what should be the \"build\" with the source code. When developing, the sanitizers can be added and help ensure there is strong checks with proper memory usage and addressing etc.\r\n\r\n#### Proper sanitizing and bug catching \r\n\r\nFor instance, I found a buffer overflow in the tests within the ctaes library (inside crypto) which was found trivially after setting up a proper standalone CMake file for it. This was found within hours of me poking around and was there for a number of years. Makes one wonder how many other bugs are simple low hanging fruit, just waiting to be picked.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nAccording to [The Developer Ecosystem in 2020: How C++ is Doing](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2020/06/dev-eco-cpp-2020/) , the C++ community is moving with conviction to CMake as their build system of choice. Over the last couple years its gone from 34% to 53% of developers choosing it over Makefiles or Visual Studio. If the trend continues, it is imperative the project invests in improving the current status quo.\r\n\r\nBegin adding CMake files to cover the major OSs Windows, OSX, Linux on the major processors x86_64. Then expand out to ARM and the smaller targets like Raspberry Pis and the like. Eschew the many optimizations and custom-tailored functions/modules for specific architectures and just add the generic standard library versions until the entire project builds and tests properly.\r\n\r\nWhile this is a \"monumental task\" as noted by @sipa , the hardest part will be decoupling of the many build steps with source code, but thats more tedious and repetitive than anything. \r\n\r\nI can and already have a couple CMake files for some modules like crypto and ctaes to start off. What I am not sure of exactly is the flow of direction between the libraries in the \"bitcoin-core\" project and this one. Which one follows which?\r\n\r\n",
