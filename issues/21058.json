    "body": "I wanted to log (especially incoming) onion connections.\r\nWas unsure if category `net` or `tor` would do that.\r\n\r\nIn the debug log you do not see which debug message is of what category, or if it is of no debug category at all (standard log).\r\n\r\nI would like if debug log categories are logged e.g. with a `[<debug log category>] ` prefix.\r\nE.g. for `net` debug category log line, the line is currently logged like this (I hope I am right that this belongs to `net`category, so this is an example of the uncertainty that results in the current absence of the category logging):\r\n`2021-02-01T19:33:08Z SOCKS5 connected zncs3yn6h4l7c3z7.onion`\r\n\r\nMy wish would be that it would be logged like this:\r\n\r\n`2021-02-01T19:33:08Z [net] SOCKS5 connected zncs3yn6h4l7c3z7.onion`\r\n\r\nIf that would have any drawback like log gets bloated, an option to toggle debug log category prefix logging could be introduced, e.g. `debugcategorylogging=<1|0>`",

I think there should be a better logging with pairing of log category and log level (e.g. like in Tor log), but that should be out of the scope of this PR.\r\nI have read the developer notes, and because of section \"Source code organization\" I extra included the `#include <map>` in `logging.cpp` allthough it was not needed to successfully compile.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am no C++ expert and I guess there are chances that the places/scope of the definitions may be not optimal.\r\nAny help for doing better is appreciated.\r\nI saw the need to clone the function `LogCategoryPrintf` because I had not seen a way to change `__VA_ARGS__` to insert the log category string in the beginning of the first (format string) parameter.\r\nI have allowed edits by maintainers, too, your are welcome to edit.",
