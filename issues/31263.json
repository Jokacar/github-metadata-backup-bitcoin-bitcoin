Blocks up to 2 hours before the earliest timestamp\r\n                                   of all descriptors being imported will be scanned as well as the mempool.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also tried using timestamps several days into the future, but still see about 2 hours worth of blocks being rescanned. I want to be able to import a description without triggering any block rescan.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nI expect the behavior to match the docs.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Run importdescriptors with the timestamp set to \"now\"\r\n2. See in the log that the wallet rescanned some blocks\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv28.0\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nSome kind of Debian\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
