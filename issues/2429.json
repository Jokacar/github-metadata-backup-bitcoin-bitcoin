    "body": "Providing a stack list of past receive addresses as a top level GUI element encourages reuse, it makes addresses seem like something scarce which should be conserved. It also can result in people accidentally sending coins to addresses created prior to wallet encryption.\n\nThe interface should probably be adjusted to make it clear that used addresses are used and shouldn't be reused, e.g. by only displaying the initial digits of all but the most recent address and requiring context click to get details.\n",

I'd maybe make it a checkbox or something, if not remove it completely -- oh, just realized it's because it uses the \"Label\" field. Seems like a bad idea to me, since payment-protocol addresses are probably not going to be reused...\n",
