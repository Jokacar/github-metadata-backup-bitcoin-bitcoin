    "body": "This suggests a strategy to run the functional tests with both v1 and v2 transport in the CI.\r\n\r\n**Status Quo:**\r\nThere is both the global `--v2transport` option for the `test_runner.py` (not enabled by default), plus the possibility to specify `--v2transport` for particular tests, which is used for a handful of tests. Currently, when running `test_runner.py --v2transport`, these tests are run twice with the same `--v2transport` configuration, as has been noted in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29358#discussion_r1485626063, which is wasteful.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Change:**\r\nFix this by adding a `--v1transport` option and using it in `test_runner.py`, so that irrespective of the global `--v2transport` flag, the  tests that run twice use v1 in one run and v2 in the other.\r\nAlso add `--v2transport` to one CI task (`multiprocess, i686, DEBUG`).\r\nThis means, that for each CI task, the majority of functional tests will run once using the global `--v2transport` option if provided, while a few selected tests will always run two times, once with `v1` and once with `v2`.\r\n\r\n**Rationale:**\r\nA simpler alternative would have been to remove all test-specific `--v2transport` commands from `test_runner.py` and just enable `--v2transport` option for a few CI tasks. I didn't do that because it would have meant that v2 would never be running in the CI for some platforms, and also be run a lot less locally by users and devs (who would have to actively enable the `--v2transport` option).

          "body": "#24748 added v2 transport to the python `P2PConnection`, but so far each test that wants to make use of it needs to enable it on an individual basis.\r\nThis PR changes it so that if the test suite is run with `--v2transport` option, v2 is used in each test by default, not only for connections between two bitcoind instances as before, but also wherever `P2PConnection` is used. Individual tests can override this global option.\r\n\r\nTo do that, a few tests need to be adjusted.\r\nIn addition, I added a commit to always use v1 in a few select subtests that send a large number of large messages (e.g. large reorgs). These tests don't have a fundamental problem with v2 but become very slow due to the unoptimised python ChaCha20 implementation (~30 minutes on my computer, so probably not suitable to be run in the CI).\r\n\r\nAs a result, `python3 test_runner.py --v2transport` should succeed and use `v2` everywhere (unless v1 is chosen explicitly).\r\n\r\n[Edit]: To make the \"test each commit\" CI pass, several test fixes were squashed into the last commit, which actually enables v2 p2p for `P2PConnection`. I have an unsquashed version at https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/tree/202401_bip324_alltests_unsquashed, in case that helps with review.\r\n\r\n",

Disconnection happens when AAD of first encrypted packet after the garbage terminator is not filled\r\n5. bitcoind ignores non-empty version packet and no disconnection happens\r\n\r\nAll these tests require a modified v2 P2P class (different from `EncryptedP2PState` used in `v2_p2p.py`) to implement our custom handshake behaviour based on different scenarios and have been kept in a single test file (`test/functional/p2p_v2_misbehaving.py`). Shifted the test in `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py` which is of the same pattern to this file too.",

          "title": "Broadcast own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections",
          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* Independent improvement (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29419):\r\n  * `log: deduplicate category names and improve logging.cpp`\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

Light client support, see [BIP 352](https://github.com/josibake/bips/blob/silent-payments-bip/bip-0352.mediawiki#user-content-Tweak_Data)\r\n2.
