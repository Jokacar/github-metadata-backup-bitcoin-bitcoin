    "body": "This PR creates a common interface for `CMutableTransaction` and `CTransaction` as the template class `CBaseTransaction<T>`. This base class uses the CRTP (curiously recurring template pattern) in order to achieve static polymorphism. This way this change shouldn't have any effect on behaviour or runtime performance (though compilation performance is of course worse).\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n - Creates a common, explicit interface type for `CTransaction` and `CMutableTransaction`.\r\n - Makes explicit common elements between two classes.\r\n - Functions that accept have a better option than accepting an unrestricted typename T.\r\n - Better than proliferating custom `static_assert` or `enable_if` with different, obscure error messages when the template is applied to the wrong types.\r\n\r\nPS: This PR shouldn't affect performance or behaviour, but please review thoroughly as it touches consensus-sensitive code.",

It is not necessary because sighash for the same `nHashType` is always the same _inside_ a `CHECKMULTISIG`. Therefore, we could reuse a sighash as long as the `nHashType` is not changed.\r\n\r\nNote that in `CHECKMULTISIG`, the trimming of `scriptCode` (with `CODESEPARATOR` and `FindAndDelete()`) is done before the signature checking loop. So the `scriptCode` is always a constant in the same `CHECKMULTISIG` operation. However, this is not guaranteed across different `CHECKSIG` or `CHECKMULTISIG` so a cross-opcode sighash cache could not be done in the same way.",

Then derive `class CTransaction` from `CPureTransaction`\r\n* Deduce a `CPureBlock` which references `CPureTransactions` in its `vtx`.\r\n\r\nDeserialization now only takes 14% of the wall clock time it took previously on my machine. You can check locally with:\r\n```\r\n./bench_bitcoin --filter=DeserializeBlockTest && ./bench_bitcoin --filter=DeserializePureBlockTest\r\n```\r\nSending a single historic block now takes slightly less (90% of the wall clock time it took previously) on a local network.
