I could trace it down to bd13dc2f46ea10302a928fcf0f53b7aed77ad260 (#26076), but I don't know descriptor wallets enough to understand what's going on (cc @Sjors @achow101).\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\n`bitcoind` starts, or at least tells me to use a later version if #26076 was a breaking change instead of corrupting `wallet.dat`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n(master, clean chain): \r\n`createwallet -regtest \"\"`\r\n(v25.0rc2):\r\nfirst `bitcoind -regtest` succeeds\r\nthen stop and restart the node: The second `bitcoind -regtest` leads to an InitError:\r\n`Error: Error: Unable to expand wallet descriptor from cache`\r\nnow, the wallet cannot be loaded by either version.\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\r\n\r\nCompiled from source\r\n\r\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\r\n\r\nv25.0rc2 / master\r\n\r\n### Operating system and version\r\n\r\nUbuntu\r\n\r\n### Machine specifications\r\n\r\n_No response_",

It seems less brittle if we add `std::string m_raw_descriptor` and hold on to the original there. Presumably that means `ToString()` is only used once at generation time.\r\n\r\nThis would however break if you downgrade ~and then upgrade again. That in turn could be fixed by detecting the error condition, recalculating the hash (and wiping or modifying the cache records).~\r\n\r\n~In other words when loading a descriptor, if the hash is wrong, try replacing `'` with `h` and see if that works. If so, modify the record.~ (<- I don't think this works, but leaving the thought)\r\n\r\nThere's a similar downgrade - upgrade breakage introduced by #26728, although it's much harder to hit (you have to downgrade, encrypt and then upgrade). That PR introduces a new flag which is currently optional, but it's an option (though not ideal) to make it mandatory. Thereby preventing a downgrade.",

We can't do much there. Old releases will still read the descriptor, and calculate the id by hashing the apostrophe formatted descriptor string.\r\n\r\nThe main point here is that every single descriptor record in the wallet database is keyed by the descriptor id. So.. if we change the spkm id calculation in newer versions, old software versions will not be able to connect the descriptor entries: keys, caches, etc. with the descriptor itself.\r\nAnd, even worst, after finish the loading process, the wallet will store a new descriptor entry (because the wallet re-writes the descriptor post `TopUp()`), keyed by the hash of the apostrophe formatted descriptor string... which conflicts with the string inside the descriptor, which is what causes this unrecoverable state.\r\n\r\nOverall, I don't think that there is a good workaround for the downgrading topic. We cannot change the past, unless we make people migrate to a newer database format, or..  we store records duplicated in the db.. with the two possible ids.. but that would be the dirties thing ever.\r\n\r\nSo, I think that we will have to live with the apostrophe formatted descriptor string IDs for now. Which is not ideal, but.. it isn't really an issue anyway.",

      "body": "> Living with apostrophe is one option, but the other is to prevent downgrades.\r\n\r\nHaven't seen #26728 yet but preventing downgrades on descriptors wallets sounds bad for me. Users already face enough difficulties with their legacy wallets and the migration process for now. We should try to avoid breaking the descriptors wallet compatibility now too.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I believe this isn't a major problem really, we just had a bad design decision by making the software calculate the db key on-demand, but it is not the end of the world. We can stick to the current implementation and clearly state that descriptor IDs are calculated by hashing the apostrophe-formatted descriptor string. And, in the future, if we ever want to replace the db key for something better, we can take the opportunity to propose a better overall database format and implement the changes all at once.",
