    "body": "This PR contains the first part of #28608, which tries to make assumeutxo code more maintainable, and improve it by not locking `cs_main` for a long time when the snapshot block is connected, and by deleting the snapshot validation chainstate when it is no longer used, instead of waiting until the next restart.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR are just refactoring. They make `Chainstate` objects self-contained, so for example, it is possible to determine what blocks to connect to a chainstate without querying `ChainstateManager`, and to determine whether a Chainstate is validated without basing it on inferences like `&cs != &ActiveChainstate()` or `GetAll().size() == 1`.\r\n\r\nThe PR also tries to make assumeutxo terminology less confusing, using \"current chainstate\" to refer to the chainstate targeting the current network tip, and \"historical chainstate\" to refer to the chainstate downloading old blocks and validating the assumeutxo snapshot. It removes uses of the terms \"active chainstate,\" \"usable chainstate,\" \"disabled chainstate,\" \"ibd chainstate,\" and \"snapshot chainstate\" which are confusing for various reasons.",

          "body": "The validation caches are currently setup independently from where the rest of the validation code is initialized. This makes their ownership semantics unclear. There is also no clear enforcement on when and in what order they need to be initialized. The caches are always initialized in the `BasicTestingSetup` although a number of tests don't actually need them.\r\n\r\nSolve this by moving the caches from global scope into the `ChainstateManager` class. This simplifies the usage of the kernel library by no longer requiring manual setup of the caches prior to using the `ChainstateManager`. Tests that need to access the caches can instantiate them independently.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis pull request is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).",

          "body": "See #27463 for full project tracking.\r\n\r\nThis contains the first few commits of #30110, which require some thinking about thread safety in review.\r\n- Introduce a new `m_tx_download_mutex` which guards the transaction download data structures including `m_txrequest`, the rolling bloom filters, and `m_orphanage`. Later this should become the mutex guarding `TxDownloadManager`.\r\n  - `m_txrequest` doesn't need to be guarded using `cs_main` anymore\r\n  - `m_recent_confirmed_transactions` doesn't need its own lock anymore\r\n  - `m_orphanage` doesn't need its own lock anymore\r\n- Adds a new `ValidationInterface` event, `UpdatedBlockTipSync`, which is a synchronous version of `UpdatedBlockTip`.\r\n- Flush `m_recent_rejects` and `m_recent_rejects_reconsiderable` on `UpdatedBlockTipSync` just once instead of every time `AlreadyHaveTx` is called. This should speed up calls to that function and removes the need to lock `cs_main` every time it is called.\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n- These data structures need synchronization (for example, something that goes into the `m_orphanage` should not be added to `m_txrequest`. In the future, orphan resolution tracking should also be synchronized. Currently, `cs_main` is used to e.g. sync accesses to `m_txrequest`. We should not broaden the scope of things it locks.\r\n- Currently, we need to know the current chainstate every time we call `AlreadyHaveTx` so we can decide whether we should update it. Every call compares the current tip hash with `hashRecentRejectsChainTip`. It is more efficient to have a validation interface callback that updates the rejection filters whenever the chain tip changes.",

Transaction download logic refers to the process of deciding what transactions to request, download, and validate.[1]\r\nAll of the changes here should result in no behavior change.\r\n\r\nThere are several benefits to this interface, such as:\r\n- Unit test coverage and **F U Z Z I N G** for logic that currently isn't feasible to test as thoroughly (due to the code paths not being reachable through `PeerManager` without a ton of overhead) and/or currently only lightly tested through `assert_debug_log` ( :-1: ) in functional tests.\r\n    - See for example the `MempoolRejectedTx` test, where we can define a matrix of expected outcomes for each `TxValidationResult` and test them very easily.\r\n    - For fuzzing, see the `txdownloadman` and `txdownload_impl` targets.\r\n- When we add more functionality (e.g. package relay messages, more robust orphan handling), the vast majority of it will be within `TxDownloadManager` instead of `PeerManager`, making it easier to review and test.\r\n- A thinner and easier-to-use interface for `PeerManager`, which will no longer know anything about / have access to `TxOrphanage` or rejection caches. Its primary interface with `TxDownloadManager` would be:\r\n    - Notify `txdownloadman` of tip changes (i.e. passing on some `ValidationInterface` callbacks)\r\n    - Tell `txdownloadman`when a {transaction, package} is {accepted, rejected} from mempool, and receive a few instructions\r\n    - Each time a peer connects or disconnects + sanity check functions during cleanup\r\n    - Pass transaction `inv`s, `notfound`s to `txdownloadman` and receive instructions on what to validate\r\n    - Get the `getdata` requests to send\r\n    - Get the transactions to reconsider in `ProcessOrphanTx`\r\n    - Get whether a peer `HaveMoreWork` for the `ProessMessages` loop\r\n    - ^note that there are some cleanups I still have to do, so it's not this clean yet, but this is the vision. For example, while I'm writing this, I plan to make `Find1P1CPackage` private to `TxDownloadImpl`\r\n    - ^in the future, it would also pass package-related messages on, and we would reuse the `PackageToValidate` struct to return the things `peerman` needs for validation.\r\n- (todo) with some more interface changes, we can make this manager internally thread-safe instead of having `PeerManager` handle it (e.g. currently it locks `cs_main` to synchronize accesses to `m_txrequest`!)\r\n\r\n[1]: This does not include transaction announcements, i.e. what we *send* to our peers. All of that happens after we download/accept a tx. Txreconciliation (erlay) is excluded from this module, as it is part of announcements and/or part of helping the other peer decide which `inv`s to send.",

As a result, this simplifies the `kernel::Notifications` interface.\r\n- removes warnings.cpp from the kernel library\r\n- removes warning globals\r\n- adds testing for the warning logic\r\n\r\nBehaviour change introduced:\r\n- the `-alertnotify` command is executed for all `KernelNotifications::warningSet` calls, which now also covers the `LARGE_WORK_INVALID_CHAIN` warning\r\n- the GUI is updated automatically whenever a warning is (un)set, covering some code paths where it previously wouldn't be, e.g. when `node::AbortNode()` is called, or for the `LARGE_WORK_INVALID_CHAIN` warning\r\n\r\nSome discussion points:\r\n- ~is `const std::string& id` the best way to refer to warnings? Enums are an obvious alternative, but since we need to define warnings across libraries, strings seem like a straightforward solution.~ _edit: updated approach to use `node::Warning` and `kernel::Warning` enums._",

But this is a fragile assumption that can be easily broken by `ActivateBestChain`/`ConnectTrace` changes, and in fact is currently broken (since d96c59cc5cd2f73f1f55c133c52208671fe75ef3 from #25740) when the assumeutxo snapshot block is validated. In that case the background validation `chainStateFlushed` notification is sent _before_ the `blockConnected` notification so writing the locator as the best block would record a best block that was never processed. This specific change does not cause a problem for the wallet, because the wallet ignores events from the background validation chainstate. But nothing prevents similar out-of-order `chainStateFlushed` notifications from being sent in the future, so it is safer for the wallet to not rely on the chain tip sent in `chainStateFlushed` notifications.\r\n\r\nA good followup to this change would probably be to drop the `ChainStateFlushed` locator argument entirely so it is not misused in the future. Indexing code already stopped using this locator argument a long time ago for identifying the best block (in 4368384f1d267b011e03a805f934f5c47e2ca1b2 from #14121), though it is currently using the locator argument to log diagnostic warnings.",

These changes should also improve code organization and make functions easier to discover. Some of these same moves are (or were) part of #28690, but did not help with code organization, or made it worse, so it is better to move them and clean them up in the same PR so code only has to change one time.\r\n",

          "body": "Fixes #28598: currently if assumeutxo were to be used, transactions might get shown as confirmed even while the entire chainstate is unconfirmed.\r\n\r\nThis also adds an `assumed` value to `listtransactions` etc, shown only for confirmed transactions when a snapshot is loaded.\r\n\r\nThe UI experience for assume utxo still needs work. This PR makes the wallet UI safer by not rendering transactions as fully confirmed until the background validation is done.\r\n\r\nInstead it shows the same icon as when a transaction has 1 confirmation. This is quite conservative. The cost of tricking someone into accepting a fake coin, by giving them a invalid snapshot`*` and then mining a block on top of it, is higher than a regular doublespend by mining.\r\n\r\n![pending](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/10217/a2a95190-a1a7-402e-822b-b0829d5bdf45)\r\n\r\n`* =` in the current implementation this involves giving someone a malicious binary or getting them to recompile\r\n\r\nCaveat: because transaction state is updated after `blockConnected`, if you restart the node during background sync, then the transaction will show as fully confirmed (`\"assumed\": false`) briefly - until the next block is connected.",

          "title": "tracing: Only prepare tracepoint arguments when actually tracing",
          "body": "Currently, if the tracepoints are compiled (e.g. in depends and release builds), we always prepare the tracepoint arguments regardless of the tracepoints being used or not. We made sure that the argument preparation is as cheap as possible, but we can almost completely eliminate any overhead for users not interested in the tracepoints (the vast majority), by gating the tracepoint argument preparation with an `if(something is attached to this tracepoint)`. To achieve this, we use the optional semaphore feature provided by SystemTap.\r\n\r\nThe first commit simplifies and deduplicates our tracepoint macros from 13 TRACEx macros to a single TRACEPOINT macro. This makes them easier to use and also avoids more duplicate macro definitions in the second commit.\r\n\r\nThe Linux tracing tools I'm aware of (bcc, bpftrace, libbpf, and systemtap) all support the semaphore gating feature. Thus, all existing tracepoints and their argument preparation is gated in the second commit. For details, please refer to the commit messages and the updated documentation in `doc/tracing.md`.\r\n\r\nAlso adding unit tests that include all tracepoint macros to make sure there are no compiler problems with them (e.g. some varadiac extension not supported). \r\n\r\nReviewers might want to check:\r\n- Do the tracepoints still work for you? Do the examples in `contrib/tracing/` run on your system (as bpftrace frequently breaks on every new version, please test master too if it should't work for you)? Do the CI interface tests still pass?\r\n- Is the new documentation clear? \r\n- The `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE(event, context)` macros places global variables in our global namespace. Is this something we strictly want to avoid or maybe move to all `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE`s to a separate .cpp file or even namespace? I like having the `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE()` in same file as the `TRACEPOINT()`, but open for suggestion on alternative approaches. \r\n- Are newly added tracepoints in the unit tests visible when using `readelf -n /src/test/test_bitcoin`? You can run the new unit tests with `./src/test/test_bitcoin --run_test=util_trace_tests* --log_level=all`.\r\n<details><summary>Two of the added unit tests demonstrate that we are only processing the tracepoint arguments when attached by having a test-failure condition in the tracepoint argument preparation. The following bpftrace script can be used to demonstrate that the tests do indeed fail when attached to the tracepoints.</summary>\r\n\r\n`fail_tests.bt`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bpftrace\r\n\r\nusdt:./src/test/test_bitcoin:test:check_if_attached {\r\n  printf(\"the 'check_if_attached' test should have failed\\n\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nusdt:./src/test/test_bitcoin:test:expensive_section {\r\n  printf(\"the 'expensive_section' test should have failed\\n\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the unit tests with `./src/test/test_bitcoin` and start `bpftrace fail_tests.bt -p $(pidof test_bitcoin)` in a separate terminal. The unit tests should fail with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning 594 test cases...\r\ntest/util_trace_tests.cpp(31): error: in \"util_trace_tests/test_tracepoint_check_if_attached\": check false has failed\r\ntest/util_trace_tests.cpp(51): error: in \"util_trace_tests/test_tracepoint_manual_tracepoint_active_check\": check false has failed\r\n\r\n*** 2 failures are detected in the test module \"Bitcoin Core Test Suite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nThese links might provide more contextual information for reviewers:\r\n- [How SystemTap Userspace Probes Work by eklitzke](https://eklitzke.org/how-sytemtap-userspace-probes-work) (actually an example on Bitcoin Core; mentions that with semaphores \"the overhead for an untraced process is effectively zero.\")\r\n- [libbpf comment on USDT semaphore handling](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/blob/1596a09b5de2a50ab8d44218fc29b6d42f886305/src/usdt.c#L83-L92) (can recommend the whole comment for background on how the tracepoints and tracing tools work together)\r\n- https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/UserSpaceProbeImplementation#Semaphore_Handling",

This is confusing and unintuitive.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the those last block fields to actually be in sync with the record stored on disk. This requires adding the block height to the `BESTBLOCK_NOMERKLE` record, which was done in a backwards compatible manner. Additionally, the issue with `chainStateFlushed` fixed in #29652 is also fixed here by removing `chainStateFlushed` entirely. The last block fields, now simply the best block, is updated for each `blockConnected` and `blockDisconnected` so that it does actually represent the block for which the wallet is synced up to.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to deal with, the best block fields are consolidated into a `BestBlock` struct which also has the serialization code with backwards compatibility.",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [x] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick). [DONE, see [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/research-into-the-effects-of-a-cluster-size-limited-mempool-in-2023/794/1)]\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add duplicate transactions to the mempool (#29990).\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts.

          "body": "When restarting `bitcoind` during an ongoing reindex without setting the `-reindex` flag again, the block and coins db is left intact, but any data from the optional indexes is discarded. While not a bug per se, wiping the data again is\r\nwasteful, both in terms of having to write it again,  as well as potentially leading to longer startup times. So keep the  index data instead when continuing a prior reindex.\r\n\r\nAlso includes a bugfix and smaller code cleanups around the reindexing code. The bug was introduced in b47bd959207e82555f07e028cc2246943d32d4c3: \"kernel: De-globalize fReindex\".",

          "title": "Stratum v2 Template Provider (take 3)",
          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. Compared to #28983 it introduces EllSwift in the handshake and fixes various bugs. I used that opportunity to change the branch name, which makes testing against [SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) slightly easier. There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #30200\r\n- [ ] #29295\r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #30205\r\n\r\n### Related useful issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] #30209\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

Migration of legacy wallets uses the independent BDB parser and a minimal `LegacyDataSPKM` that allows the legacy data to be loaded so that the migration can be completed.\r\n\r\nAll tests which tested legacy wallet behavior have been removed. The `--descriptors` and `--legacy-wallet` options are removed from the functional tests.\r\n\r\nBDB has been removed as a dependency and documentation have been updated to reflect that.\r\n\r\nDepends on #26596",
