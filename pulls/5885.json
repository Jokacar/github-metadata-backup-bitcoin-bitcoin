    "body": "This replaces the OpenSSL-based random number generation code with a built-in implementation of Fortuna.\n\nIt is seeded from operating system entropy (/dev/urandom etc), a variety of environment entropy (which is strengthened), and very precise CPU timings. Expensive (more than a few millisecond) seedings are only done at startup, others occur every few minutes. Data from RPC, processing and network events is additionally fed into the entropy pool. This should give us fairly safe operation even in case operating system entropy code is broken.\n\nFurtermore, it unifies the insecure and secure random number generator, and makes the private key generation code always request OS entropy (which is likely better than we can do, but we still want to protect against it being broken).\n\nTODO:\n- Better environment information on OSX and Windows\n- Seeding from GUI events into the pool.\n- Unit tests for the Fortuna implementation.\n",

      "body": "I'm happy about this approach.\n\nWe've seen operating system RNG's fail silently in really frightening ways several times over the last few years,  a belt-and-suspenders approach where silent failure at least gets a best effort bit of entropy-snake-oil (or maybe not so snakeoil: after going and writing a bunch of entropy collecting code I'm more impressed with the performance than I expected) seems to be a clear improvement.  OpenSSL's (and libressl's) system entropy randomness generator is also pretty scary (it can fail silently back to snakeoil entropy much weaker than what this code does).\n\nWe'll want to take good care to make sure GetOSEntropy is portable and safe.  Maybe we should introduce a startup time test to get GetOSEntropy that just checks that it's not outputting a constant. I wouldn't expect an _actual_ OS failure to do that, but e.g. if some massive screwup has replaced /dev/urandom with a file (easier than you might think...) it could be helpful.\n\nRight now this code has no fork safety.  A fork() will end up with a clone of the pool state. That StrongRandom always goes to the OS helps add confidence that total doom is unlikely, but we might want to deal with this case even though we never fork just in case someone adds something that forks later and doesn't think about it.  A PID vs last_pid test in the random calls that triggers a GetSystemRand(slow=0) would I think be all that it would take.\n\nBeyond the nits I am adding the only big obvious gaps were that there is no facility to roll entropy from the pool forward across restarts. We should probably GetStrongRandom() on clean shutdown and write out a entropy file that gets fed back in at startup.  Perhaps system rand can take an argument, and thats how the config environment could also be passed in?\n\nThere are plenty of missed opportunities to collect extra entropy (e.g. from UI events; UPNP real-IP, other hosts provided ping nonces) that don't fit into line level patches, as those files aren't even touched.\n",

At the time, thought about calling the OpenSSL insecure rand, but its API was not orthogonal to secure rand, unfortunately.  It had side effects I wasn't happy with, so just stuck with the regular OpenSSL secure rand, even though I wasn't happy about it needlessly consuming the entropy pool, which is a somewhat precious resource.  Would it be worth changing the ping nonce to use insecure rand instead, or keep it secure and await this fine new implementation?\n",

See here: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commits/aes-keys. This is a WIP; it still needs loads more testing.\n\nI'll submit a PR to discuss that after this is merged, but in the meantime you may want https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/a22fcf2d2835d4f50e357ca0125d55b54a0ccb15 and https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/a4d109e33cc247430054fe1a81bdc668456338c8.\n\nI'm not sure if my test failures were due to other local changes or not, but either way I don't think it would hurt.\n\nSide-node: I think that (along with the fortuna stuff here, @laanwj's libevent stuff, and libsecp256k1) is the last of the openssl stuff that needed to be re-implemented.\n",

As I understand it, he is comfortable with pulling this part in before the rest of fortuna.\n\nThe bulk of changes here are tests, the actual changes are small. Tests verify that encryption/decryption/keygen work as expected, but also that the results match openssl's exactly (including output buffers in failure cases).\n\nThe aes-cbc decryption attempts to be done in constant-time, in case it's re-used in the future in places that may be susceptible to timing attacks. It works with/without padding, so it could be re-used in different contexts.\n\n@sipa I copied your structures for AES_Decrypt/AES_Encrypt for the sake of simplicity, so there's a good bit of duplication here now. I'm happy to re-work with templates, merged classes, separate files, etc.\n\nBesides the unit tests, I've also done some quick sanity checks via rpc to verify that switching back and forth between implementations works as expected. Wallets encrypted with openssl still decrypt fine, and likewise the other way around.\n",

      "body": "This sounds good, but I have to play devils advocate here. The problems with OS randomness on Android was caused by exactly this kind of logic:   \"we can do better than the kernel with a spiffy userspace RNG\". And then they screwed it up.\n\nNow, I trust sipa and gmaxwell to not screw things up. I am much less sure about the faceless unknowable individuals who will come later in the years after sipa has moved on, or who will patch Bitcoin as it gets packaged into distributions, etc. I do not trust them.\n\nI especially do not trust that crypto code that is Windows specific will be well tested and will never break, given the extreme bias towards Linux and Mac that exists in the Bitcoin developer community.\n\nIf there is no Bitcoin Core RNG, then people will not be tempted to \"improve\" it and break it in the process. If there is, they will.\n\nRandomness theory says we cannot beat the kernel. The kernel has all the sources of entropy available to it that a userspace app does, plus more that we don't have access to. Kernel RNGs are also rare and carefully monitored: I trust the Linux, Darwin and Windows kernel teams a lot more than I trust userspace RNG developers. Kernels are unlikely to ship in a broken state. So, reading from /dev/urandom or CryptoAPI should be all that is required. Why add more complexity on top?\n\nI am especially unkeen on things like \"let's mix in the current time or the value of CPUID\", because mixing in uselessly low value pieces of entropy is how both the Debian and Android randomness flaws evaded detection for so long - the output _looked_ random but only had ~16 bits of entropy in it from the PID counter. Everything else broke but the PID kept the illusion alive for longer than should have been possible.\n\nSo - why go further than /dev/urandom?\n",

      "body": "The primary reason is because the kernel has repeatedly screwed it up too on various systems, both due to OS bugs (e.g. recent Netbsd and Freebsd examples) and because of things like running in virtual machines where the environment was just too deterministic.  These are not hypothetical problems, but have been observed in practice and recently too.\n\n> Kernels are unlikely to ship in a broken state.\n\nKernels have shipped in a broken state, and they've been \"broken in the field\" by poor use, like use in a VPS that denied them adequate access to randomness; by hypervisor checkpoint and restore, and by other issue.\n\n> or who will patch Bitcoin as it gets packaged into distributions, etc. I do not trust them\n\nI don't trust distributors either, (though I do trust future contributions as much as ourselves, all bets are off if they're malicious or even more foolish than we are). It is obvious that the utmost care is required in structuring things not just so its correct, but so that the result is easy to audit, testable, and hard to break; for sure. This includes the above comment about incorporating the system RNG in key generation in the final step in a transparent and hard to break way. If someone wants to twiddle the rest, then great. The potential for harm is bounded when whatever gets done is just getting xored with /dev/urandom.  \n\n(Though unlike OpenSSL we would not consider using undefined behavior ... almost guaranteeing the result would get broken, if not by a helpful packager than by a future spec compliant compiler)\n\n\"Just use /dev/random\" is also fraught with peril on its own, it requires a file descriptor, if one isn't available you cannot get to the device. It's also slow and if you use the blocking form it will reliably block on Linux systems which are often entropy starved (due to a campaign of removing low quality entropy sources in the kernel in the last that Linux hasn't yet recovered from); the blocking is fine for our highly critical long term key generation, but other places where we might need non-determinism it isn't really. If the non-blocking /dev/urandom is used, you are exposed to getting non-random bits even when the kernel knows better (e.g. near bootup time).   There is no escaping peril, we can only seek to understand and control the risks.\n\n> the output looked random but\n\nSadly this problem also exists with the kernel itself.  Our setup must be such that if the kernel fails in a detectable way, we fail. Regardless; all the rest is for the cases where the kernel has failed undetectably.\n\n> Randomness theory says we cannot beat the kernel\n\nI'm not aware of any such theory. What I am aware of is that we have entirely different constraints; when the kernel RNGs have failed none of them have managed to still emit output which was machine specific, though its not hard to do so in userspace.  In some abstract sense the kernel has access to more data, but operates under different constraints and so we know it doesn't actually make use of that data (at least in Linux and the BSDs; the windows source is not generally available, so I don't know what it does internally).  As another example, we're also able to use a huge amount of hardening; so even if the kernel has failed in an undetectable way and there is only a moderate amount of non-determinism from other sources there is a chance that the user will be secure regardless. Likewise, we can roll state forward between runs, so even if the system state is only intermittently random the user can be practically secure; something else that is not generally available in the kernel.\n\nFor some time it looked like Linux /dev/u?random was going to be replaced with rdrand, and I think our users wouldn't have appreciated that. I think it's fair to say that when we're generating keys our demands as we're creating long term keys for public use which thousands to millions of dollars can be immediately lost if they're insecure, is unlike 99.999% of the kernel random use.\n\nLikewise, if our ability to read OS entropy silently breaks on windows then those users are in trouble regardless of what else we've done. So we must assure we don't, and that we detect and fail if we do if detection is even possible. This is true regardless of whatever else we're doing.\n\nWe also know from the Bitcoin space (web wallet entropy failures) that users still lose (lots) money if the randomness returned is the same as other users. So, trying to make undetectable failures more user transparent is already known to not really work.\n\nA further consideration is that OpenSSL already does this, and so it would be arguably unwise in the \"what were you thinking??!?? sense to replace it something with more known total failure modes. The OpenSSL implementation is inherently more fragile than anything we'd consider using (including silent failure when it knows the OS rng is failing for it); OpenSSL's \"more secure fork\" LibreSSL replaces the code but also includes a similar fallback. Both do this in OS specific code, so it's not likely they're defending against unknown operating systems.\n",

There is definitely a fair amount of complexity here, which - assuming the OS randomness works fine - is totally irrelevant. The whole point of course is belt-and-suspenders: what if somehow the OS randomness is not fine. For that reason, I also agree the result should be trivially correct assuming OS randomness is fine (i.e., for queries that require strong randomness, we should do a call to the OS, and mix in our own randomness afterwards). And yes, if the OS randomness call fails, the entire request should fail. We shouldn't knowingly reduce security - it's only intended to protect against unknown failure.\n",

You can never distinguish good randomness from properly secured bad randomness (eg attacker replaces your /dev/random with stream cipher output for which only they have the key).  This is code that needs (and I am sure will get) plenty of attention and auditing.\n\nAs for justifications, there is a tendency for the OS to silently break things or fail in spectacular ways. RDRAND has been the sole source of randomness multiple times, contrary to popular opinion.\nhttp://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.cryptography.randombit/4689\nJust xoring in more stuff isn't the answer. djb points out attack scenarios with a malicious entropy source:\nhttp://blog.cr.yp.to/20140205-entropy.html\n\nEC is brittle when it comes to poor randomness.  While using deterministic modes is clearly the preferred answer, entropy for key generation is still needed and providing a sane interface to a decent library is a major improvement to the entire bitcoin ecosystem.\nhttp://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/03/surviving-bad-rng.html\n\nAlso, heroku instance under syn scan (not syn flood, just a port scan):\nhttps://gist.github.com/jwilkins/5997306\nhttps://gist.github.com/jwilkins/5997296\n\nThis is an excellent (though java focused) guide to RNG concepts, part 3's discussion of degrees of freedom is particularly valuable for people in the bitcoin space:\nhttp://blog.uncommons.org/2008/04/03/a-java-programmers-guide-to-random-numbers-part-1-beyond-javautilrandom/\nhttp://blog.uncommons.org/2008/04/06/a-java-programmers-guide-to-random-numbers-part-2-not-just-coins-and-dice/\nhttp://blog.uncommons.org/2008/04/10/a-java-programmers-guide-to-random-numbers-part-3-seeding/\n",

I'm also familiar with it in another way: on account of that post the \"watch that basket\" argument is the go-to trope in the IETF used to argue against any non-TLS crypto)\n\nFortuna itself designed to be robust against malicious inputs.  If we assume the kernel is maliciously observing our process (e.g. to give us bad randomness that xor cancels the next fortuna output) we're kind of all bets off there-- simply because it could more directly undermine our behavior.  We _could_ combine them with a cryptographic hash instead,  which would be more secure against malicious input, I'm just wary about having any avoidable complexity in that one part, because its the one part that requires the most careful review.\n\nBack on DJB's post, before anyone takes up that argument...\n\n> But if the attacker sees the RNG state that was used to generate your long-term SSL keys, long-term PGP keys, etc., then what exactly are we gaining by coming up with unpredictable random numbers in the future? \n\nThe security of _future_ keys.  Sometimes there aren't any future keys, and indeed, additional inputs are not helpful, sometimes (as is the case for us) they are.\n\nImagine, someone manages to heartbleed out the state of your RNG. Thats bad, but its even worse if it forever predicts your output.\n\nThe argument he gives applies more broadly then some might think, by that argument you'd generate a random state once and store it on disk, and just use that state... but this is clearly crazy because it's obvious that the data on disk has a different security exposure than data elsewhere. The same is otherwise true.   We do already avoid using 'new randomness' where it makes sense to avoid it because it can't buy us anything-- e.g. in signing.\n\nAnother place where forward secure randomness is helpful is against process replay.  Consider the OpenSSL state cloning bug on fork() on android:  Processes were launched by forking(), the new tasks got a copy of the rng state and replayed randomness. If they each independently had been adding additional (even low entropy, like the address of their stack) randomness then the problem would have been avoided or reduced (e.g. if it didn't reliably add before the copy was used).  The same can also play out with process and VM snapshotting: if you only have a deterministic state, someone might resume an old copy without realizing the consequences, then use it to do different things.\n",

I think it's the opposite. Android _was_ mixing in additional low entropy (the pid counter) and this is why the bug made it into production. If wallets had been making the exact same sequence of random numbers across process restarts then that would have been noticed almost immediately, as it'd have shown up in the UI and other such things. By mixing in the pid they ensured that the outputs only cycled occasionally - long after the apps had been shipped to production and money was stolen.\n\nThe Android bug was especially catastrophic because the mixin of the persisted operating system entropy happened _after_ the zygote process started, so all you had to do to compromise thousands of wallets was buy a phone, measure the initial randomness for every possible PID and you're done. That's why I insisted on a simultaneous crash rollout of the fix: if anyone had realised the true nature of the bug, the Bitcoin ledger could have been hopelessly corrupted by theft to an extent that it'd have set the project back by years.\n\nThis is why this kind of RNG work is so dangerous. The history of industrial randomness is a long story of programmers thinking that _they_ would be better than all the other schlubs, that _their_ RNG would be simple and elegant and give better performance or robustness. After all, how hard can a RNG possibly be? And then they discover they made some impossible to detect mistake, or someone else patched their code, and it all came unravelled.\n",

          "body": "@sipa @sdaftuar @jtimon @petertodd \nOK, this is the best combination of approaches I could put together.\n\nI took #6455 and I removed the floating relay fee commit.  I really like that idea, but it needs to be much slower acting I think and not subject to potential abuse.  That can be a later improvement.\n\nI added 3 things:\n- Reserved space between the soft cap and hard cap.  The soft cap is currently set to 70% of the hard cap.  Once the soft cap is hit, you first try to evict as in 6455, but if you fail, you have another chance to get in if you are still under the hard cap.  There are 10 \"rate zones\" between the hard cap and soft cap and the effective minRelayRate to get into the mempool doubles for each additional zone.\n- Any required minRelayFee for your transaction alone is considered inside the StageTrimToSize loop.\n- Periodically (once a second) we use the knowledge that surplus fees over the minRelayRate must have been paid if the size of the mempool is over the soft cap.  We use these fees in aggregate to try to trim from the bottom of the mempool.  This allows us to aggregate many small high fee transactions to evict a low paying large transaction or long chain.\n\nThe reject rates in my test setup have dropped to 0.3% for 30k feerate tx's and 0.05% for 60k feerate tx's. (See other results in #6455).\n\nI made an attempt to tweak the looping parameters in StageTrimToSize to something that I think made sense, but with the contrived test setup, and only one set of simulation data, they are probably best evaluated on the basis of intuition and not relying entirely on the resulting rejection rates.\n\nIt turns out the slowest part of StageTrimToSize was GetRand() by a long shot, so I hacked it out, but I'm sure @sipa will want to replace my hack with something nicer.\n\nThe code works as is, but could still use some work, but I think its time to get more eyes on this suggestion for a plan forward.\n",

          "body": "This updates the libsecp256k1 subtree to upstream master, and switches ECDSA validation to it.\n\nPractical upshot:\n- Signature validation is anywhere between 2.5 and 5.5 times faster.\n- Consensus code no longer depends on OpenSSL or its signature parser.\n- Removes linking with OpenSSL from libconsensus.\n\nLibsecp256k1 itself has not had a stable release, but we're very close to that. This PR is effectively a preview, with the intention of switching to the released version before the Bitcoin Core 0.12 release.\n\nThe past months libsecp256k1 has undergone very extensive testing and validation, though some of that work is still under review. This includes:\n- Very high branch coverage (which required generating a trillion random test vectors and strip them down to the 32 which collectively give the highest coverage for the scalar arithmetic code)\n- Formal proofs for the group laws using SAGE, and human-verifiable proof annotations for the field arithmetic logic.\n- Test code that generates random valid DER signatures, fuzzes them, and compares the result of parsing them internally and using OpenSSL - which turned up a set of (to me) previously unknown behaviour in OpenSSL's parser.\n- The ability to compile in a test mode which switches to a slightly different curve (one constant change), resulting in a group of only 139 points instead of around 2<sup>256</sup>, allowing exhaustive testing of nearly all code.\n\nThe above things are planned to be finished before final release, as well as some API changes - though probably none that affect Bitcoin's usage.\n\nThanks to everyone who contributed so far (including but not limited to @gmaxwell, @apoelstra, @peterdettman, @theuni, @luke-jr, ...).\n",

Not all libevent functions are available in the API so `event_new()`, `event_free()` and `event_base_loopbreak()` had to be added to `net.h`. A few compiler warnings are generated but these can be ignored or removed if this pull request is acceptable.\r\n\r\nThe libev developers have the following to say about compiler warnings (https://linux.die.net/man/3/ev):\r\n\r\n> While libev is written to generate as few warnings as possible, \"warn-free\" code is not a goal, and it is recommended not to build libev with any compiler warnings enabled unless you are prepared to cope with them (e.g. by ignoring them). Remember that warnings are just that: warnings, not errors, or proof of bugs.",
