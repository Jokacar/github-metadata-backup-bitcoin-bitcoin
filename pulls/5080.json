          "body": "This proposal arose from a conversation I had with @mathieudutour about how to fund authors of small but valuable open-source projects.\r\n\r\n**tl;dr**: proposal for a way to tip package authors from NPM, request for comments and suggestions.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to support yourself whilst contributing to open-source. Typically, maintainers of open-source projects do so in their spare time, with varying degrees of support from the community, whilst working in an unrelated position.\r\n\r\nAlso, maintaining an open-source project is more than just coding. When you maintain an open-source project of any size there are numerous support tasks to perform: triaging emails and issues, handling pull requests, managing dependencies and, if there are additional contributors on the project, organizing and distributing the workload. This can be extremely time consuming and lead to a feeling of “[this is more than I signed up for](https://medium.com/open-collective/why-and-how-to-fund-the-open-source-projects-you-depend-on-da62a582307)”.\r\n\r\nIf you want to work on open-source full time, your options are currently:\r\n\r\n* work for Facebook or another large company with the resources to hire open-source developers\r\n* find an organization to sponsor you\r\n* appeal to users of your packages to sponsor you\r\n* or, as at least one developer has done, [quit your job and move to Thailand](https://blog.sindresorhus.com/answering-anything-678ce5623798)\r\n\r\nWhilst these solutions may work for some people they certainly do not satisfy every case.\r\n\r\nWhat would be nice is a way for open-source developers and package maintainers to receive financial contributions for their work *without* having to ask for it and for those developers to be able to continue to work in open-source *without* being restricted by their job or employer.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that it is *hard* for users of open-source software (developers like you and I, businesses, educational institutes, etc.) to give money to the people that create it. There are some projects in place that try to smooth this problem but they all feel disjointed from a developer's workflow and require extensive setup.\r\n\r\n[Patreon](https://patreon.com/) is a good solution, allowing users to contribute to supported projects by pledging an amount to a project each month. The Patreon model has supported artists and designers successfully, along with several game studios (notably the guys behind [Dwarf Fortress](https://www.patreon.com/bay12games)). The downside to Patreon is that, due to the full-featured nature of the platform, the pledging process is quite involved. \r\n\r\nAnother solution that exists is to donate to an awesome organization like [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) and let them support open-source projects for you. This works pretty well (and it has certainly helped the likes of [mocha](https://opencollective.com/mochajs) and [webpack](https://opencollective.com/webpack)) but it still requires a measure of setup and feels quite 'heavy' for what should be a simple task. There is also the caveat that the project you want to support will not necessarily be featured!\r\n\r\nA third possibility is [Tip4Commit](https://tip4commit.com), a platform that allows one-off Bitcoin payments to be sent to supported projects. Tip4Commit requires less setup that the other platforms (there is no account required, for instance), however, as with the other solutions, it does not easily integrate with the development process and requires additional steps to be taken.\r\n\r\nThe question remains: how can users of open-source software easily contribute to the packages they use, without additional setup and without interrupting their development flow?\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6Nu7wwm.gif\">\r\n\r\nThis pull request extends `npm` to provide an additional command: `tip`. Using the `tip` command, users can send a financial contribution, a tip, to packages they are using and find valuable. The contribution can be sent from the command line, without downloading an additional tool and with very minimal setup!\r\n\r\nTo tip a package, a user must perform the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. link a Bitcoin account to send tips from using `npm connect-tip-account`\r\n2. tip an awesome package using `npm tip`\r\n\r\nThe first command, `connect-tip-account`, accepts a `type` and the tokens required to access the account API. These tokens are securely stored in the operating system keystore. There is currently only one supported account type: `coinbase`. Coinbase is a Bitcoin trading platform and a common place to store Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nOnce an account has been set up, using the second command, `tip`, will use the account API to send a transaction to the authors of the specified package. For this to happen the package will need to have set the `tipAddress` property in it’s `package.json`. The [tippable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tippable) package is available as an example.\r\n\r\nThe pull request includes help documentation with more information about each command.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\nOne improvement that was discussed is the provision of an auto-tipping feature. Auto-tipping would attempt to tip a project whenever `npm i` is run, using a specified or default amount. By enabling auto-tipping with a small default amount, the user would be supporting the packages they use without having to perform the action each time.\r\n\r\nAn extension to this would be the ability to set a periodic (daily, weekly or monthly) budget: once the budget has been exceeded the auto-tipper is disabled until the period has elapsed. This would prevent unexpected spending during periods of high-usage. Alternative schemes are conceivable and are discussed in the Questions and answers section, below.\r\n\r\n### Why is tipping sent using Bitcoin?\r\n\r\nBitcoin lends itself nicely to the problem as it is a digital currency with numerous providers exposing APIs. It is possible for anyone to create a Bitcoin address and begin to send or receive tips, regardless of nationality or locale. A bonus of using Bitcoin is the support of *m-of-n* addresses: addresses that require multiple keys to sign transactions from the account. This feature could allow packages with multiple authors to collectively manage their tips.\r\n\r\nOne problem with Bitcoin is that it doesn't handle micro-payments very well: sending a really small amount, such as $0.01, can cost more in fees than the value of the transaction. Coinbase imposes a limit that transaction values must be at least 0.0001 BTC.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to implement a truly agnostic tipping system but that was deemed to be beyond the scope of this pull request.\r\n\r\n## Questions for you\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution begs many questions and some initial answers have been given here. However, there are lots of unanswered questions and one of the motivations of this pull request is to find some answers to these.\r\n\r\n### What should happen if a tip is sent a package that has not specified an address?\r\n\r\nCurrently, nothing. One possibility is that the funds are sent to a 'holding' address and may be redeemed for a number of days by the author. The problem with this is the requirement to maintain such a holding address which, presumably, would need a trusted third-party.\r\n\r\n### Should it be possible for my employer to pay for my contributions?\r\n\r\nThis is a motivating question as many employers make extensive use of open-source software and it would be amazing if some opted to use such a scheme to provide some contribution. With the current scheme this is possible by performing the following set-up:\r\n\r\n1. create a single employer account or an account specific to each employee\r\n2. give each employee unique tokens to access an account (either the single, central account, or their own)\r\n3. fund the account(s) and encourage employees to tip valued packages\r\n\r\nThis solution is slightly limited, however, as the employer has no record of what has been installed, nor any assurance that the employee is using the account for work alone. One conceivable scenario is that an employee could be deliberately installing their own packages in order to profit.\r\n\r\nAdditional development, such as the logging of any tips made and, in the event of the inclusion of auto-tipping, centralised control of budgets, is required for this to work in the wild.\r\n\r\n### How would you want auto-tipping to handle sub-dependencies?\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of utility libraries that are used across a large number of packages (e.g. `lodash.anything`); there are also packages that are extended by other packages (e.g. `mongodb` is extended by `mongoose`) and may be infrequently or never installed by themselves. These packages are deserving of support and it would be nice to handle that automatically.\r\n\r\nIt is important that, in providing users with the ability to easily tip and support the packages they use, that the way packages are created and deployed is not affected.\r\n\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n\r\n**babel and lodash**\r\n\r\n`babel` is a commonly-used package, the use of which typically requires several dependencies: `babel`, `babel-core`, `babel-loader`, `babel-polyfill`, etc. In the naive auto-tip implementation, each of those packages would receive a tip, despite many such packages being written by the same authors to perform the same or similar tasks as a unit.\r\n\r\nAnother example is `lodash`: some projects will use the modularized versions of several [lodash methods](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/lodash-modularized), resulting in a number of dependencies, by a particular set of authors, that are part of a single library or larger package.\r\n\r\nThere is a danger that unscrupulous package maintainers will divide their packages into multiple components to capitalize upon auto-tipping users. This clearly needs to be mitigated against.\r\n\r\n### How would you like auto-tipping to split the tips across the budget period?\r\n\r\nThere are several obvious schemes that each have positive and negative aspects, described below. These schemes could be implemented and chosen at the user's discretion, using configuration settings in `.npmrc` or perhaps a separate `.npmtip` file.\r\n\r\n**First-come, first-served**\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution is to tip, using a specified amount, each time a package is installed. When the budget has run out the auto-tipper is disabled until the next budget period begins. The downside to this scheme is that packages installed at the end of the month are unlikely to ever receive any contribution.\r\n\r\n**Equal shares**\r\n\r\nAnother simple solution is to log all installations across the budget period and, at the end of the period, equally divide the budget amongst the packages and send the tips. One possible problem here is that a large number of installations may lead to each share being extremely small - potentially too small to be effectively transacted by the Bitcoin network.\r\n\r\n**Weighted shares**\r\n\r\nIt may be desirable to tip some packages more than others, such as those used in every project (`babel` may be a good example here, or a framework such as `react`). This presents a problem, however: how to design a metric that defines this desirability?\r\n\r\nOne possible metric is the *frequency of installs* of packages, where packages installed more frequently are ranked higher. This seems like a reasonable suggestion.\r\n\r\nAnother possible metric is the *size* of packages, using the assumption that larger packages have taken more work to create and, perhaps, deserve more contribution as such. The size of a package could be easily measured in lines of code or tarball size. This metric has two potential caveats, however: the first is that size does imply quality and the second is that, if such a scheme were adopted, it is conceivable that unscrupulous package authors may simply write longer, more verbose code - a practise surely to be discouraged.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion is to use code inspection to determine the *number of times a given package was imported*, where a oft-imported package is given a larger share of the budget. However, determining the number of imports presents it’s own problems: when should the count be taken, does a first import from one project ‘weigh’ the same as the 100th import from another, etc.\r\n\r\nA final consideration is that some users may wish to create a custom weighting - to contribute a larger proportion to certain favorite or small projects. This scheme could feasibly be used with any of the others by including a list of package-specific weightings inside the configuration settings.\r\n\r\n## Disclosure\r\n\r\nI would like to acknowledge that I believe some people will be unhappy with this proposal as it allows open-source to be seen in a more financial light. It is possible that, if such a proposal were accepted, more people would contribute to open-source as a means of work and, in some cases, the focus could shift from altruism (or whatever the current motivation may be) to profit-driven. My own feelings on this matter are not clear but I do feel like the possible benefits are numerous and outweigh the possible negatives.\r\n\r\n> Never postpone experiments that have clearly defined future benefits for fear of dangers that can't be quantified - James Watson\r\n\r\nI would also like to make it known that I am not affiliated with Coinbase, Bitcoin, or any of the projects mentioned.
