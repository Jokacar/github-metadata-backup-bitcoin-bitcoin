    "body": "A couple of users have requested that we support wallets that encrypt everything, even if the wallet is watch-only, in order to have better privacy if the wallet is stolen. This PR introduces an `EncryptedDatabase` backend for the wallet which encrypts/decrypts each key-value record individually before reading from or writing to the database.\r\n\r\n`EncryptedDatabase` is only supported for SQLite databases and descriptor wallets. This was done in order to have an easier way to get downgrade protection that also does not involve writing an existing record in plaintext (e.g. `minversion` or `flags`). SQLite has a fixed field \"application id\" that we already use for cross-network protection. This is reused to detect if a sqlite database is an encrypted wallet, and thus it prevents older software from attempting to open such wallets.\r\n\r\nIn order to read records from the database, `EncryptedDatabase` will cache the decrypted key in memory so that it can lookup the encrypted key in the database. Values will always be decrypted when read.\r\n\r\nThe encryption scheme is the same one that we use for encrypting private keys. It's not that great, but I didn't feel like re-implementing it, and it seems good enough. The encryption key itself is encrypted with the passphrase and stored in a new record.\r\n\r\nWallets with encrypted databases cannot be loaded on start. They can only be loaded by explicit user action through `loadwallet` which now has a `db_passphrase` parameter to allow the decryption of these wallets. `createwallet` also has a `db_passphrase` to create these wallets. For now, there is no way to encrypt the database after it has been created, nor is there a way to change the passphrase.",

          "body": "The wallet currently does not know the master key that was used to generate the automatically generated descriptors. This makes it difficult to add new automatically generated descriptors when new ones are introduced. So instead of losing this information after the descriptors are created, have `CWallet` store it. The xpub will be stored in a new `activehdkey` field. The private key must be one of the keys that is used by the descriptors, and will be extracted upon loading.\r\n\r\nAs this is a new field, wallets will be automatically upgraded upon loading. This loading is backwards compatible and uses a new non-required flag `WALLET_FLAG_GLOBAL_HD_KEY` to signal that the upgrade completed. The upgrade will search for an xpub that is shared by `pkh()`, `wpkh()`, and `sh(wpkh()` descriptors with the derivation pattern that we use. For new wallets, the xpub will be set during descriptor creation rather than trying to reverse engineer it. The flag will be set for all wallets, regardless of whether such an xpub was found or can even exist, in order to indicate that the upgrade will not need to be run in the future.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to have a `gethdkey` command which is useful for those who need a simple way to get an xpub from a wallet. `gethdkey` can also take a boolean parameter to indicate whether it should also output the corresponding xprv.\r\n\r\nSupercedes #23417",

This will be used for dumping legacy wallet records and migrating legacy wallets without the need for BDB itself.\r\n\r\nWallettool's `dump` command is changed to use `BerkeleyRODatabase` instead of `BerkeleyDatabase` (and `CWallet` itself) to demonstrate that this parser works and to test it against the existing wallettool functional tests.",

This is especially useful when a new default descriptor has been implemented as it allows wallets created before that time to quickly and easily add that type of descriptor.\r\n\r\nIn particular, descriptor wallets created before Taproot was implemented can use the new `createwalletdescriptor` RPC in order to get a Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to keep the newly generated descriptor in line with the existing descriptors, this PR uses #26728 as it exposes a \"wallet extended key\" for us (in addition to upgrading wallets implemented prior to have a wallet xpub). The newly generated descriptors will use the \"wallet extended key\" stored in `CWallet` that PR adds.\r\n\r\n`createwalletdescriptor` is generic and so it can also be used with the other address types. Of course, it given the same wallet extended key, address type, and internal-ness, it will create the same descriptor. So some refactoring has been done in order to detect that the same descriptor is about to be created, and to avoid overwriting any existing descriptors.",

It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",

          "body": "## For reviewers\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to make reviewing a bit more sane, I'm breaking this up into a few smaller PRs, but will keep this one open as the parent PR and keep it rebased on the child PRs. The main purpose of having this PR is to track progress on child PRs and also have an easy way to compile `bitcoind` with both send and receive support for testing. Additionally, I'll be adding more functional tests to this PR since it's much easier to test when `bitcoind` can both send and receive.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122\r\n  - Implements the logic from BIP352 without any wallet code. This PR adds the necessary cryptographic functions and implements the logic needed for sending and scanning. This PR also includes the test vectors from the BIP as unit tests. Both the send and receive PRs have this as a dependency. In terms of priority, this PR should be reviewed first\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201\r\n  - Implements sending in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to send to a silent payment address, regardless of whether or not the wallet can receive silent payments\r\n  - Ready for review, but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28202\r\n  - Implements receiving in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to generate silent payment addresses and scan for silent payments, regardless of whether or not the wallet can send to a silent payment address\r\n  - Ready for review but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n\r\nFor the silent payments specification, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458\r\n\r\n## Overall\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the full silent payments scheme: sending and receiving. The following items are not covered in this PR and are intended for follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n* Adding labels for the receiver wallet\r\n* Full RPC coverage (only `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` are covered in this PR)\r\n* Light client support (vending the tweak data per block, either in an index or to serve to indexer, such as electrum server)\r\n* Add benchmarks to validate that there are no DoS concerns for doing silent payment verification for transactions in the mempool\r\n* External signer support (dependent on hardware wallets supporting silent payments)\r\n* More unit / functional test coverage\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24897. Below is a summary of the major changes:\r\n\r\n* Remove labels\r\n  * The original draft included labels, but this has been deferred for a later PR. Labels are not necessary for sending and receiving and there are still some open questions on how best to implement them in Bitcoin Core. Labels can also be added at any point by the receiver without requiring any changes from the sender\r\n* Remove indexes\r\n  * In the original draft, indexes were used when scanning for silent payments and when doing wallet rescans. This has been removed in favor of using `rev*.dat` files for rescanning. It may make sense to add an index in the future, but for the purpose of vending tweak data to light clients, which is still an open question\r\n* Update to implement the most current version of BIP352\r\n  * Since the original draft, there have been a few changes in the BIP which are reflected in the current PR. Most notably, using 33-byte compressed keys for the silent payment address (as opposed to X-only keys in the original draft) \r\n\r\nIt may be helpful for context to read through the discussions on #24897 , but ongoing review should happen in the relevant child PRs listed above.",

I run a full node that is on an unencrypted external drive. Bitcoin data is public data, it shouldn't be encrypted. I want to use the wallet for a watch-only wallet though. Unfortunately the wallet files live alongside the public blockchain data so I would have to store the wallet on an unencrypted drive (that I occasionally want to borrow out to friends for them to copy the blockchain in order not to have to download it). That would reveal my entire wallet to anyone that gets hold of this drive.\r\n\r\nSame would hold for a laptop. The blockchain is public data, encrypting it entirely is just a pointless performance loss. So it should always be stored on an unencrypted disk for performance reasons. But then you can't use the wallet. Even an encrypted wallet (currently only encrypting the private keys) leaks your entire wallet's history.",

          "body": "This PR implements receiving silent payment transactions through the use of a new `ScriptPubKeyMan` type: `SilentPaymentsSPKM`. This is a descriptor wallet only feature, although it does not use descriptors.\r\n\r\nThis is an optional feature, so the only way to use it is to create a new wallet with `createwallet` with `silent_payments=true`. Such wallets will have a single `SilentPaymentsSPKM` that is used for both receiving and change. Since silent payments only have a single address, repeated calls to `getnewaddress` and `getrawchangeaddress` always return the same address, however the receiving and change addresses are different, see the BIP for how the change is generated.\r\n\r\nSince silent payments requires the spent coins in order to extract public keys from them, `TransactionAddedToMempool` is modified to also provide that information. For scanning blocks, the wallet will retrieve that information from the undo data. Additionally, when rescanning, a silent payments wallet must use the slow rescan method.\r\n\r\nThe labels feature has not been fully implemented yet and is left for a followup.\r\n\r\nBased on #28122 and #28201 \r\n\r\nAlternative to #28202",

With this patch, they are no longer required to include in order to use the libbitcoinkernel library. This also allows for the removal of the `compat.h` header from the kernel headers.\r\n\r\nAs an added future benefit it also reduces the number of of kernel headers that include the platform specific `bitcoin-config.h`.\r\n\r\nFor those interested, the currently required kernel headers can be inspected visually with the [sourcetrail](https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/Sourcetrail) tool by looking at the required includes of `bitcoin-chainstate.cpp`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587), namely its stage 1 step 3: Decouple most non-consensus headers from libbitcoinkernel.\r\n",

To be able to use `createwalletdescriptor` with the other address types, we need a way to change the wallet extended key, and so `sethdseed` has been updated and enabled for descriptor wallets. As with legacy wallets, when called without parameters, it will generate a new random master key for the wallet. It can also take a xprv and set that as the master key. It still takes a BIP 32 seed as WIF or as hex as we do for legacy wallets. The seed will be transformed into and stored as a BIP 32 extended key. The latter is to give us greater compatibility with other wallets which often produce non-WIF HD seeds.\r\n\r\nSplit from #25907",
