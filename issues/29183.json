    "body": "This issue will be edited frequently to reflect the current status of the project.\r\n\r\n#### What should I review now? \r\n\r\n👇 👇 👇 👇 \r\n-- #30118 --\r\n☝️ ☝️ ☝️ ☝️\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to enable complete blockchain rescan capability on prune nodes, allowing these storage-limited nodes to import new wallet descriptors and update existing ones at any time, as well as loading external and un-synced wallets with a birth-time older than 48 hours. This, in turn, enables the monitoring of new addresses/scripts and tracking balance changes without the need to repeatedly download the entire blockchain.\r\n\r\nThe first project milestone introduces the feature for prune nodes that construct and maintain a local block filters set database. The node will request and keep track of the missing historical blocks that match the wallet scripts filters set to subsequently perform the rescan.\r\n\r\n#### The following sections are ordered by their PRs dependencies:\r\n\r\n##### Net: Single Block Requests Tracking System and On Download Failure Retry Mechanism\r\n* [x] #28170\r\n* [x] #28120\r\n* [ ] #30118\r\n* [ ] #27837\r\n\r\n##### Indexes Stability and Performance Improvements\r\n* [X] #27607\r\n* [X] #27720\r\n* [x] #28955\r\n* [ ] #26966\r\n\r\n##### Wallet Rescan (depends on the net section)\r\n* [X] #27469\r\n* [ ] Cache wallet filters' set and connect it to the current wallet rescan functionality. (Pending)\r\n* [ ] Wallet: implement \"rescan status\" class to track the progress and retrieve it via an RPC command. (Pending)\r\n* [ ] Wallet: introduce prune node rescan functionality.

In\r\nsuch cases, upon reconnecting to the network, the node might only establish\r\nconnections with limited peers, filling up all available outbound slots.

Or, even could be employed in\r\nspecial procedures like a prune node rescan that uses BIP158 block filters,\r\nor even into BIP157 itself.",

Seems like it would be ideal to eliminate the electrum server requirement. Bitcoin Core 0.21.0 has support for BIP157 and a large percentage of publicly accessible nodes on the network (https://bitnodes.io/nodes/) are running a version of bitcoin core greater than 0.21.0.\r\n\r\nBIP157 isn't perfect, but it seems better than trusting a single electrum server. If you run your own bitcoin core node without an electrum server, you need to rely on bitcoin core to watch the wallets from sparrow. It seems like it would be a better design to have sparrow wallet keep track of things instead of require the two to always be in sync with each other. This way you connect to any bitcoin core node and things just work.",

I'm not sure if https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/commit/91d491f5eca4b967590f4cfa943d52f63b90530e or another commit removed it.\r\n\r\nIf doing the following to import an existing wallet (instead of File->Import Wallet):\r\n\r\n1. File->New Wallet\r\n2. Check \"has existing transactions ...\"\r\n3. select a day before the first transaction\r\n4. New or imported Software Wallet\r\n5. Use 24 words\r\n6. enter seed\r\n7. Create Keystore\r\n8. Import Keystore\r\n9. Apply\r\n\r\nNo accounts are discovered and clicking Add Account there is no discover button.\r\n\r\nHowever, doing  File->Import Wallet does discover the accounts correctly. However, when going to Add Account, the discover button also isn't there (but in this case isn't needed because automatic discovery on import worked).\r\n\r\nI think any way you import a software wallet, it should automatically discover accounts. Also if you go to Advanced and change the birthday or gap limit it should re-try to discover accounts.\r\n\r\n",
