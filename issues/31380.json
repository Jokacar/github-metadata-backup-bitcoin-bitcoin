These suggestions cover multiple substantial protocol changes that would each require extensive design, discussion, and review processes.\r\n\r\nPull requests that implment any of these features would be welcome for review here, and these would allow the community to properly evaluate the specific implementation details, security implications, and trade-offs involved.\r\n\r\nFor now, I'll be closing this issue to help keep our issue tracker manageable. Please feel free to:\r\n- Start discussions about these ideas in the [Bitcoin development mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev?pli=1), or on [Delving Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/)\r\n- Submit separate, detailed proposals for each feature (maybe best in the BIPs repo)\r\n- Submit pull requests with implementations for review\r\n\r\nThanks again for your ideas about ways to make Bitcoin better.",
