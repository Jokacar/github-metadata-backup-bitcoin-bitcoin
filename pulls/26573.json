    "body": "Based on #26567. Alternative to #23502.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when estimating the size an input spending a Taproot output will have once signed, we always assume the key path will be used. Even if there are script paths. This can lead to pretty severe fee underestimation if the script path turns out to be used in the end. So instead assume the most expensive between all script paths and the key path will be used.\r\n\r\nThis is still not ideal, as there may be a huge gap between the size of a script path spend and a key path spend. Still, this is less bad than undershooting the fees.",

But, it's a bug on v24\r\n   (check [#26559](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26559)).\r\n\r\n   This method it's being fixed and not removed because I'm later using it to solve\r\n   another bug inside this PR.\r\n\r\n2) As we update the total cached amount of the `CoinsResult` object inside\r\n   `AvailableCoins` and we don't use such function inside the coin selection\r\n   tests (we manually load up the `CoinsResult` object), there is a discrepancy\r\n   between the outputs that we add/erase and the total amount cached value.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n* This makes use of the `CoinsResult` total amount field to early return\r\n  with an \"Insufficient funds\" error inside Coin Selection if the tx target\r\n  amount is greater than the sum of all the wallet available coins plus the\r\n  preset inputs amounts (we don't need to perform the entire coin selection\r\n  process if we already know that there aren't enough funds inside our wallet).\r\n\r\n### Test Coverage\r\n\r\n1) Adds test coverage for the duplicated preset input selection bug that we have in v24.\r\n  Where the wallet invalidly selects the preset inputs twice during the Coin Selection\r\n  process. Which ends up with a \"good\" Coin Selection result that does not cover the\r\n  total tx target amount. Which, alone, crashes the wallet due an insane fee.\r\n  But.. to make it worst, adding the subtract fee from output functionality\r\n  to this mix ends up with the wallet by-passing the \"insane\" fee assertion,\r\n  decreasing the output amount to fulfill the insane fee, and.. sadly,\r\n  broadcasting the tx to the network.\r\n\r\n2) Adds test coverage for the `CoinsResult::Erase` method.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTO DO:\r\n* [ ] Update [#26559 ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26559) description.",

The most recent consensus is that a [minimal approach](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25732) is best. \r\n\r\n",

          "body": "When producing a dummy signature for the purpose of estimating the transaction fee, do not assume an external signer performs R-value grinding on the signature.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this avoids a scenario where the fee rate is 1 sat / vbyte and a transaction with a 72 byte signature is not accepted into our mempool.\r\n\r\nSuggested testing:\r\n1. On master, launch with `-signet` and create an external signer wallet using e.g. a Trezor and HWI, see [guide](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/external-signer.md#example-usage) (with the GUI it should \"just work\" once you have the HWI path configured).\r\n2. Create a few addresses and fund them from the faucet: https://signet.bc-2.jp/ (wait for confirmation)\r\n3. Create another address, and now send the entire wallet to it, set the fee to 1 sat/byte\r\n4. Most likely this transaction never gets broadcast and you won't see it on the [signet explorer](https://explorer.bc-2.jp) \r\n\r\n5. With this PR, try again.\r\n6. Check the explorer and inspect the transaction. Each input witness starts with either `30440220` (R has 32 bytes) or `30440221` (R has 33 bytes). See this explainer for [DER encoding](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/92680/what-are-the-der-signature-and-sec-format).\r\n\r\nFixes #26030 ",

          "body": "It is useful to have a RPC that can create and add the automatically generated descriptors (that are normally made during creation) to a wallet. This is especially useful when a new default descriptor has been implemented as it allows wallets created before that time to quickly and easily add that type of descriptor.\r\n\r\nIn particular, descriptor wallets created before Taproot was implemented can use the new `createwalletdescriptor` RPC in order to get a Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to keep the newly generated descriptor in line with the existing descriptors, this PR uses #26728 as it exposes a \"wallet extended key\" for us (in addition to upgrading wallets implemented prior to have a wallet xpub). The newly generated descriptors will use the \"wallet extended key\" stored in `CWallet` that PR adds.\r\n\r\n`createwalletdescriptor` is generic and so it can also be used with the other address types. Of course, it given the same wallet extended key, address type, and internal-ness, it will create the same descriptor. So some refactoring has been done in order to detect that the same descriptor is about to be created, and to avoid overwriting any existing descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo be able to use `createwalletdescriptor` with the other address types, we need a way to change the wallet extended key, and so `sethdseed` has been updated and enabled for descriptor wallets. As with legacy wallets, when called without parameters, it will generate a new random master key for the wallet. It can also take a xprv and set that as the master key. It still takes a BIP 32 seed as WIF or as hex as we do for legacy wallets. The seed will be transformed into and stored as a BIP 32 extended key. The latter is to give us greater compatibility with other wallets which often produce non-WIF HD seeds.",

          "title": "wallet, spkm: Move key management from DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan to wallet level KeyManager",
          "body": "This PR changes DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan to no longer handle relevant keys directly. Instead all keys for all DescriptorSPKMs will be handled by a new `KeyManager` class which exists within `CWallet` (a reference to it is passed to each DescriptorSPKM). This allows us to have a concept of a wallet HD key for descriptor wallets. This makes it easier to add new single key descriptors that use the same HD master key as the rest of the autogenerated descriptors (e.g. for taproot). Multisigs will also be easier as an xpub belonging to the wallet can be exported without needing to do weird things like descriptor introspection and guessing about which descriptor's key to use.\r\n\r\n`KeyManager` is a class which handles all of the keys for DescriptorSPKMs. It contains the maps that hold the keys, deals with writing those keys to disk, and handles their encryption. Encryption keys are still managed by `CWallet` but provided to `KeyManager` through the `WalletStorage` interface. Signing is still done through `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan::SignTransaction` however this will fetch the keys from `KeyManager` rather than storing keys in the DescriptorSPKM to be used.\r\n\r\nThis change is backwards compatible. Although `KeyManager` writes and uses keys in new `keyman_key` and `keyman_ckey` records, it will still write keys for each descriptor in `walletdescriptorkey` and `walletdescriptorckey` records. This allows a descriptor wallet created using this change to be opened by 22.0 and 0.21. Additionally, wallets created with older software will automatically be upgraded to using the `KeyManager` at first loading. This is done in the background and does not require any user interaction (i.e. no passphrase required).",

          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",

It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",

          "body": "Builds on top of #25907 and one commit from #22341.\r\n\r\nFirst this PR introduces a descriptor wallet RPC `addhdseed`. Similar to its legacy wallet counterpart `sethdseed` it either generates a fresh random seed, for use on a blank wallet, or the user can provide a WIF. Unlike `sethdseed` this RPC call does not add keys / fill the keypool.\r\n\r\nThis allows a user to create a blank wallet (`createwallet`), provide it with a seed (`addhdseed`) and then craft custom descriptors. (An alternative approach would to add a `nodescriptors` argument to `createwallet`, but this RPC seems useful anyway)\r\n\r\nAn example use case of this is setting up a multisig between Core and a hardware wallet. After adding the seed to an otherwise empty wallet, the user would call `getxpub m/87'/0'/0'`. They would then combine this `xpub` and origin info with the one from their hardware wallet (e.g. using `hwi --fingerprint .... getxpub m/87'/0'/0'`  and craft a descriptor like `wsh(sorted_multi(2, [...../87'/0'/0']our_xpub, [..../87'/0'/0']their_xpub))`, and import that. The resulting wallet will be able to sign its part of the transaction.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this PR enables to ability descriptors, such as in the multisig example above, in such a way that any `fingerprint` + `xpub` that is covered by our hd seed(s) can be signed for.",

          "body": "The current taproot signing code will end up creating transactions which do not meet the feerate target. This is primarily seen when spending a taproot output with the script path. In this scenario, because the public key is known, the dummy signer would incorrectly choose to create a dummy signed transaction that used the key path spend when the actual transaction would use script path. This results in a transaction that has a significantly lower fee rate because script path spends are much larger than key path spends. This is fixed by choosing the witness with the largest stack size rather than the smallest when doing size estimation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this change can result in massively overestimating the transaction fees which is undesirable. More discussion is needed to find a good solution to avoiding that problem.\r\n\r\nThere is an additional issue in the PSBT workflow where the sighash type would be appended during finalizing, but not during size estimation. That results in a transaction that is slightly larger than estimated so there is a lower feerate. This is resolved by having the DUMMY_MAXIMUM_SIGNATURE_CREATOR include the sighash type so that when funding with a watchonly wallet, we will estimate enough fee for the largest possible signature (as we do for ECDSA with high R).\r\n\r\nTests are updated to catch these case. `wallet_taproot.py` will now use a set feerate and check if the result meets that feerate.",

Not sure about the performance implication, but if the approach is OK, caching can also be used with this solution.\r\n\r\nThis approach also fixes the bug mentioned at the end of the `wallet_abandonconflict.py` file.",

This means that `CreateTransaction` is actually unaware of any user desired locktime or sequence numbers. This can have an effect on whether and how anti-fee-sniping works.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `CreateTransaction` aware of the locktime and preset input data by providing them to `CCoinControl`. `CreateTransasction` will then set the sequences, scriptSigs, scriptWItnesses, and locktime as appropriate if they are specified. This allows `FundTransaction` to actually use `CreateTransaction`'s result directly instead of having to extract the parts of it that it wants.\r\n\r\nAdditionally `FundTransaction` will return a `CreateTransactionResult` as `CreateTransaction` does instead of having several output parameters. Lastly, instead of using `-1` as a magic number for the change output position, the change position is changed to be an optional with no value set indicating no desired change output position (when provided as an input parameter) or no change output present (in the result).",

This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs.

          "title": "wallet: Keep track of the wallet's own transaction outputs in memory",
          "body": "Currently, the wallet is not actually aware about its own transaction outputs. Instead, it will iterate all of the transactions stored in `mapWallet`, and then all of the outputs of those transactions, in order to figure out what belongs to it for the purposes of coin selection and balance calculation. For balance calculation, there is caching that results in it only iterating all of the transactions, but not all of the outputs. However when the cache is dirty, everything is iterated. This is especially problematic for wallets that have a lot of transactions, or transactions that have a lot of unrelated outputs (as may occur with coinjoins or batched payments).\r\n\r\nThis PR helps to resolve this issue by making the wallet track all of the outputs that belong to it in a new member `m_txos`. Note that this includes outputs that may have already been spent. Both balance calculation (`GetBalance`) and coin selection (`AvailableCoins`) are updated to iterate `m_txos`. This is generally faster since it ignores all of the unrelated outputs, and it is not slower as in the worst case of wallets containing only single output transactions, it's exactly the same number of outputs iterated.\r\n\r\n`m_txos` is memory only, and it is populated during wallet loading. When each transaction is loaded, all of its outputs are checked to see if it is `IsMine`, and if so, an entry added to `m_txos`. When new transactions are received, the same procedure is done.\r\n\r\nSince imports can change the `IsMine` status of a transaction (although they can only be \"promoted\" from watchonly to spendable), all of the import RPCs will be a bit slower as they re-iterate all transactions and all outputs to update `m_txos`.\r\n\r\nEach output in `m_txos` is stored in a new `WalletTXO` class. This class contains references to the parent `CWalletTx` and the `CTxOut` itself. It also caches the `IsMine` value of the txout. This should be safe as `IsMine` should not change unless there are imports. This allows us to have additional performance improvements in places that use these `WalletTXO`s as they can use the cached `IsMine` rather than repeatedly calling `IsMine` which can be expensive.\r\n\r\nThe existing `WalletBalance` benchmark demonstrates the performance improvement that this PR makes. The existing `WalletAvailableCoins` benchmark doesn't as all of the outputs used in that benchmark belong to the test wallet. I've updated that benchmark to have a bunch of unrelated outputs in each transaction so that the difference is demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a larger project to have the wallet actually track and store a set of its UTXOs.\r\n\r\nBuilt on #24914 as it requires loading the txs last in order for `m_txos` to be built correctly.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks:\r\n\r\nMaster:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       92,245,141.50 |               10.84 |    0.1% |  988,823,975.00 |  66,803,340.50 |    0.0% |      2.04 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            5,709.90 |          175,134.50 |    0.5% |       80,968.24 |      25,539.15 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|          139,396.17 |            7,173.80 |    0.6% |    1,383,390.50 |     430,276.86 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            5,055.80 |          197,792.47 |    0.3% |       80,968.10 |      25,539.02 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|                9.79 |      102,152,396.19 |    0.1% |          161.00 |          37.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,552,736.00 |              644.02 |    1.5% |   20,316,315.80 |     618,545.80 |    0.6% |      0.08 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|      114,114,732.00 |                8.76 |    0.5% |1,291,047,717.60 | 320,244,602.00 |    0.0% |      6.30 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      359,315,754.00 |                2.78 |    0.1% |4,339,447,818.00 | 136,619,757.00 |    0.7% |      1.80 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|       98,230,601.00 |               10.18 |    0.1% |  537,688,964.00 |  97,332,266.00 |    0.3% |      0.49 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n\r\nPR:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       75,319,868.50 |               13.28 |    0.2% |  863,758,229.00 |  30,892,593.00 |    0.2% |      1.66 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            2,367.62 |          422,364.95 |    1.0% |       35,785.05 |       9,893.01 |    0.2% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|            2,685.58 |          372,359.55 |    0.2% |       36,501.05 |      10,027.01 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            3,462.24 |          288,830.68 |    2.7% |       35,785.06 |       9,893.01 |    0.3% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|               11.65 |       85,838,176.97 |    0.1% |          180.00 |          42.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,563,092.60 |              639.76 |    1.5% |   20,426,154.40 |     649,953.80 |    0.6% |      0.09 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|       58,367,804.40 |               17.13 |    0.9% |  587,164,005.00 | 107,905,843.80 |    0.1% |      3.21 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      365,302,636.00 |                2.74 |    0.2% |4,349,345,147.00 | 138,730,668.00 |    0.8% |      1.83 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|      124,995,585.00 |                8.00 |    1.2% |  801,998,316.00 | 103,210,721.00 |    0.3% |      0.63 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n",

          "body": "Miniscript was targeting P2WSH, and as such can currently only be used in `wsh()` descriptors. This pull request introduces support for Tapscript in Miniscript and makes Miniscript available inside `tr()` descriptors. It adds support for both watching *and* signing TapMiniscript descriptors.\r\n\r\nThe main changes to Miniscript for Tapscript are the following:\r\n- A new `multi_a` fragment is introduced with the same semantics as `multi`. Like in other descriptors `multi` and `multi_a` can exclusively be used in respectively P2WSH and Tapscript.\r\n- The `d:` fragment has the `u` property under Tapscript, since the `MINIMALIF` rule is now consensus. See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24906.\r\n- Keys are now serialized as 32 bytes. (Note this affects the key hashes.)\r\n- The resource consumption checks and calculation changed. Some limits were lifted in Tapscript, and signatures are now 64 bytes long.\r\n\r\nThe largest amount of complexity probably lies in the last item. Scripts under Taproot can now run into the maximum stack size while executing a fragment. For instance if you've got a stack size of `999` due to the initial witness plus some execution that happened before and try to execute a `hash256` it would `DUP` (increasing the stack size `1000`), `HASH160` and then push the hash on the stack making the script fail.\r\nTo make sure this does not happen on any of the spending paths of a sane Miniscript, we introduce a tracking of the maximum stack size during execution of a fragment. See the commits messages for details. Those commits were separated from the resource consumption change, and the fuzz target was tweaked to sometimes pad the witness so the script runs on the brink of the stack size limit to make sure the stack size was not underestimated.\r\n\r\nExisting Miniscript unit, functional and fuzz tests are extended with Tapscript logic and test cases. Care was taken for seed stability in the fuzz targets where we cared more about them.\r\n\r\nThe design of Miniscript for Tapscript is the result of discussions between various people over the past year(s). To the extent of my knowledge at least Pieter Wuille, Sanket Kanjalkar, Andrew Poelstra and Andrew Chow contributed thoughts and ideas.",

          "title": "Fuzz: a more efficient descriptor parsing target",
          "body": "The current descriptor parsing fuzz target requires valid public or private keys to be provided. This is unnecessary as we are only interested in fuzzing the descriptor parsing logic here (other targets are focused on fuzzing keys serializations). And it's pretty inefficient, especially for formats that need a checksum (`xpub`, `xprv`, WIF).\r\n\r\nThis introduces a new target that mocks the keys as an index in a list of precomputed keys. Keys are represented as 2 hex characters in the descriptor. The key type (private, public, extended, ..) is deterministically based on this one-byte value. Keys are deterministically generated at target initialization. This is much more efficient and also largely reduces the size of the seeds.\r\nTL;DR: for instance instead of requiring the fuzzer to generate a `pk(xpub6DdBu7pBoyf7RjnUVhg8y6LFCfca2QAGJ39FcsgXM52Pg7eejUHLBJn4gNMey5dacyt4AjvKzdTQiuLfRdK8rSzyqZPJmNAcYZ9kVVEz4kj)` to parse a valid descriptor, it just needs to generate a `pk(03)`.\r\n\r\nNote we only mock the keys themselves, not the entire descriptor key expression. As we want to fuzz the real code that parses the rest of the key expression (origin, derivation paths, ..).\r\n\r\nThis is a target i used for reviewing #17190 and #27255, and figured it was worth PR'ing on its own since the added complexity for mocking the keys is minimal and it could help prevent introducing bugs to the descriptor parsing logic much more efficiently.",

This is unnecessary since all outputs we can sign for can be represented by a descriptor, and we can derive the size of a satisfaction (\"signature\") directly from the descriptor itself.\r\nIn addition, the current approach does not generalize well: dry runs of the signing logic are only possible for the most basic scripts. See for instance the discussion in #24149 around that.\r\n\r\nThis introduces a method to get the maximum size of a satisfaction from a descriptor, and makes the wallet use that instead of the dry-run.",

          "body": "For silent payments, we want to provide a `SilentPaymentsDestination` to be used as the recipient, which requires `CRecipient` to use something other than just the `scriptPubKey` as we cannot know the output script for a silent payment prior to transaction creation. `CTxDestination` seems like the obvious place to add a `SilentPaymentsDestination` as it is our internal representation of an address.\r\n\r\nIn order to still allow paying to arbitrary scriptPubKeys (e.g. for data carrier outputs, or the user hand crafted a raw transaction that they have given to `fundrawtransaction`), `CNoDestination` is changed to contain raw scripts.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, P2PK scripts are now interpreted as a new `PubKeyDestination` rather than `PKHash`. This results in some things that would have given an address for P2PK scripts to no longer do so. This is arguably more correct.\r\n\r\n`ExtractDestination`'s behavior is slightly changed for the above. It now returns `true` for those destinations that have addresses, so P2PK scripts now result in `false`. Even though it returns false for `CNoDestination`, the script will now be included in that `CNoDestination`.\r\n\r\nBuilds on #28244",

Some pre-work to make this easier is done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28244 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28246 , which this PR now depends on. If you want to review this PR, please review these two first. One is a move-only refactor, and the other a fairly light refactor with minimal behavior changes.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nThis PR is a child of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27827 and only implements the BIP logic without the wallet code. For the wallet implementations:\r\n* #28201 - implements sending\r\n* #28202 - implements receiving\r\n* #27827 - all three PRs together - this PR is meant for tracking progress and is useful for reviewers who want to compile all three PRs at once for testing\r\n\r\n## BIP352\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses strictly on the BIP logic and attempts to separate it from the wallet and transaction implementation details. This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing. Labels for the receiver are optional and thus deferred for a later PR.\r\n\r\nTest vectors from the BIP are included as unit tests.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing, it is strongly recommended you read https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458 and take a look at the reference python implementation on the BIP.\r\n",
