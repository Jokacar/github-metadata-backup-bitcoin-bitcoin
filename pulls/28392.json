          "body": "Fixing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28250#issuecomment-1674830104 and more.\r\n\r\nCurrently, redeem scripts longer than 520 bytes, which are technically valid under segwit rules, have flaws in the following processes:\r\n1) The multisig creation process fails to deduce the output descriptor, resulting in the generation of an incorrect descriptor. Additionally, the accompanying user warning is also inaccurate.\r\n2) The `signrawtransactionwithkey` RPC command fail to sign them.\r\n3) The legacy wallet `addmultisigaddress` wrongly discards them.\r\n\r\nThe issue arises because most of these flows are utilizing the legacy spkm keystore, which imposes\r\nthe [p2sh max redeem script size rule](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ded687334031f4790ef6a36b999fb30a79dcf7b3/src/script/signingprovider.cpp#L160) on all scripts. Which blocks segwit redeem scripts longer than\r\nthe max element size in all the previously mentioned processes (`createmultisig`, `addmultisigaddress`, and\r\n`signrawtransactionwithkey`).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem, enabling the creation of multisig output descriptors involving more than 15 keys and\r\nallowing the signing of these scripts, along with other post-segwit redeem scripts that surpass the 520-byte\r\np2sh limit.\r\n\r\nImportant note:\r\nInstead of adding support for these longer redeem scripts in the legacy wallet, an \"unsupported operation\"\r\nerror has been added. The reasons behind this decision are:\r\n\r\n1) The introduction of this feature brings about a compatibility-breaking change that requires downgrade\r\n    protection; older wallets would be unable to interact with these \"new\" legacy wallets.\r\n\r\n2) Considering the ongoing deprecation of the legacy spkm, this issue provides another compelling\r\n    reason to transition towards descriptors.\r\n\r\nTesting notes:\r\nTo easily verify each of the fixes, I decoupled the tests into standalone commits. So they can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master. Where `rpc_createmultisig.py` (with and without the `--legacy-wallet`\r\narg) will fail without the bugs fixes commits.\r\n\r\nExtra note:\r\nThe initial commits improves the `rpc_createmultisig.py` test in many ways. I found this test very\r\nantiquated, screaming for an update and cleanup.",

It turns out the test was deficient in several places when it came to testing descriptor wallets, as well as deficient in addition to failing to correctly test some releases.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these test cases, adds more informative logging, slightly refactors the entire test in order to better test future versions, and adds a 25.0 node to the test.\r\n\r\nNotable changes:\r\n* The compatibility test with 0.16 should not have been passing. The wallets were being copied incorrectly for 0.16 and resulting in 0.16 creating new wallets rather than testing the target wallets.\r\n* The downgrade test will actually be run on descriptor wallets and it will test that downgrades are successful, and a subsequent upgrade is also successful. This catches #27915.\r\n* The upgrade and downgrade test will be run on all versions up to master, rather than just 0.16, 0.17, and 0.19.",

          "body": "The logging RPC does not work as intended and as documented in its help when `0` or `none` are passed.\r\n\r\nPer the RPC logging help:\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli help logging\r\n\r\nIn addition, the following are available as category names with special meanings:\r\n  - \"all\",  \"1\" : represent all logging categories.\r\n  - \"none\", \"0\" : even if other logging categories are specified, ignore all of them.\r\n```\r\n    \r\nThe behavior and documentation were added in #11191, but over time and extended refactoring, the behavior no longer works in master and versions 22/23/24 (the last supported versions currently) -- passing `0`/`none` has no effect.  As there was no test coverage, the regressions went uncaught.  In v24, `none` became unrecognized:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli logging '[\"none\"]'\r\nerror code: -8\r\nerror message:\r\nunknown logging category none\r\n```\r\n    \r\nDuring the same time period, passing `1` and `all` has been operational and documented. \r\n\r\nSolution: detect `none`/`0` values and add test coverage in any case, and either:\r\n    \r\n- leave the functionality out, raise with an error message if the values are passed, and update the RPC help documentation, or\r\n\r\n- fix the behavior by returning early.\r\n\r\nBoth solutions involve essentially the same code size and complexity.  Given that `all`/`1` has been operational, and that `none`/`0` has been documented and appears per the code of the original PR to have been operational, it seems preferable for consistency to support `none`/`0` in symmetry with `all`/`1` and as ACKed, intended, and documented in #11191.\r\n\r\nDone by this pull:    \r\n- add missing RPC logging logic and test coverage\r\n- update the `-debug` and `-debugexclude` config options to use the same code for consistency in behavior between them, and for consistency with the logging RPC that provides the same behavior for both `-include` and `-exclude`\r\n- improve the user-facing documentation and examples; can be tested with `./src/bitcoind -h | grep -A12 \"\\-debug=<\\|debugexclude\" && ./src/bitcoin-cli help logging`\r\n\r\nIf it is decided to backport a fix, commit `Fix RPC logging behavior when \"0\" and \"none\" values are passed` could probably suffice.",

This could hold well when it was just a few outliers. But as CPFP is becoming common practice whether it is among wallets (#23074 has a few instances) or protocols (for instance the LN with anchor outputs), i'm afraid that if fees rise this can lead to significantly *underestimated* results.\r\nSee the first commit's message for details and #23074 for history.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a much simpler alternative to #23074. The point is to fix the issue before we come up with a reasonable way to track package feerates in the fee estimator.\r\n\r\nThe functional test is in a separate commit so reviewers can more easily cherry-pick it on master and see the fee estimator would return the wrong estimate.",
