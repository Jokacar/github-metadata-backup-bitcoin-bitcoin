    "body": "In order to run a Stratum v2 Template Provider as a \"sidecar\" via IPC, and to have `bitcoin-node` be reproducibly built, libmultiprocess needs to be built with guix.\r\n\r\nPresumably this would happen as part of #10102 or #30437 eventually.\r\n\r\nHowever if the TP \"sidecar\" is built on top of the Bitcoin Core codebase, like https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/48 attempts, then _that_ binary should also be Guix built. So it makes sense to track this independently.\r\n\r\nI made a naive attempt in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/48/commits/33d22b9276e10ce8e0cfabe2a5b81d3cb23d8609 by simply adding `MULTIPROCESS=1` to the depends build in `contrib/guix/libexec/build.sh`. That didn't work because curl is not accessible.\r\n\r\nA workaround along those lines would be fine for https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/48 for the time being though.\r\n\r\ncc @ryanofsky",
