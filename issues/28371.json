    "body": "While investigating an issue with a non-propagating transaction with @TheBlueMatt, it occurred to us that it can be a problem for a node to get its transactions relayed when it's surrounded solely by low-mempool-limit peers (which correspondingly have a high announced minfeefilter value). And it appears this is detectable too, as our own `mempoolminfee` would be lower.\r\n\r\nWhile obviously relay can't be guaranteed, this is a detectable situation, and it could factor into the outbound replacement logic and/or trigger something similar to the \"seek more peers\" behavior we exhibit when we appear to be not getting blocks.\r\n",

      "body": "What about discouraging outbound peers with a mempool -say- 80% smaller than ours? It seems useful in general, would solve this situation for transactions with a reasonable fee attached, and for transactions with a fee such as it would be under 60MB of unconfirmed transactions.. it's the application's responsibility to prevent this?\r\n\r\nI understand for Lightning's commitment transactions you rely on your peer to cosign a feerate update, but you would most likely have dropped to chain before getting in a situation where you are holding a commit tx whose feerate is lower than that of 60MB worth of unconfirmed transactions?\r\n\r\nWe should probably check what the node-in-a-box projects set as `-maxmempool` too.",
