    "body": "Improve new LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(),  LogWarning(), LogError() macros introduced in #28318:\r\n\r\n- Make them consistent, now all accepting the same parameters.\r\n- Make them all accept log categories, to make it possible to filter or highlight log messages from a particular component.\r\n- Make them compatible with wallet logging, which includes the wallet name in log messages.\r\n- Make them not rely on a global LogInstance, to provide better control of logging in controlled environments, such as unit tests that want to selectively capture log output, or libbitcoinkernel applications that want to have multiple instances of validation objects without mixing their log output.\r\n- Make them less verbose by not requiring category constants to be specified in individual log prints.\r\n\r\nAn [overview](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0cd1616d47e61e125eb3e573573c0c56fba6b775/src/logging.h#L293-L332) of the macros can be found in the logging header.\r\n\r\n### Problems this PR attempts to solve\r\n\r\nThe new log macros in introduced #28318 are generally great. They allow writing code that is succinct and clear, and make it a lot easier to figure out what log levels are being used. Unfortunately, the new macros are slightly less general than than needed to be used throughout the codebase. Particularly:\r\n\r\n1. The new macros cannot be used conveniently in wallet code because wallet log prints are supposed to automatically attach wallet names to log messages.\r\n2. The new macros cannot be used in libbitcoinkernel code because they do not allow specifying a logger instance.\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, the only alternative approach to solving these problems would be to reimplement these macros outside the logging framework so they could be used by wallet and validation code. This PR just takes the approach of slightly generalizing these macros so they work everywhere.\r\n\r\n### Note to reviewers\r\n\r\nI'd encourage looking at the description and code changes in this PR to evaluate it and try to come an independent judgement before looking at the discussion history. Unfortunately and regrettably, I made some dismissive comments on the previous PR, so the discussion here starts out immediately heated.\r\n\r\nA summary of the disagreement is that ajtowns believes allowing log syntax `LogDebug(m_log, \"debug message\\n\")` is [harmful](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29256#issuecomment-2085586513) if log category is part of the `m_log` argument instead of being an explicit category constant. I think omitting the explicit category constant is not a big deal, cuts down on verbosity and repetition, and allows important features like logging to different instances, and automatically adding other metadata (like wallet filenames) to log messages. Other parts of the discussion refer to earlier versions of the PR, go down various tangents, and make the argument that this PR is unnecessary, not that it is harmful.",

This removes `BCLog::Level::None` entirely -- for `LogFlags::NONE` just use `Level::Info`, for any actual category, use `Level::Debug`.\r\n\r\nAdds docs to developer-notes about when to use which level.\r\n\r\nAdds `-loglevelalways=1` option so that you get `[net:debug]`, `[all:info]`, `[all:warning]` etc, which might be helpful for automated parsing, or just if you like everything to be consistent. Defaults to off to reduce noise in the default config, and to avoid unnecessary changes on upgrades.\r\n\r\nChanges the behaviour of `LogPrintLevel(CATEGORY, BCLog::Level::Info, ...)` to be logged unconditionally, rather than only being an additional optional logging level in addition to trace and debug. Does not change the behaviour of `LogPrintLevel(NONE, Debug, ...)` and `LogPrintLevel(NONE, Trace, ...)` being no-ops.",

But in my opinion, if we ever using same category constants in disparate parts of source code, or different category constants in the same part of the source code, it means source code is badly organized and we should fix that instead of resorting to a coping mechanism of searching for constants instead of searching by source path. In my experience, I've haven't used logging frameworks that have encouraged category constants to be scattered and mixed like this, and I don't think it is a good idea.\r\n\r\nThe \"+841 -626\" refactoring is definitely :hankey:-y and I plan to drop it from this PR. The change to the log macros is meant to facilitate that refactoring, not the other way around. I do think we should stop relying on the global logging instance for libbitcoinkernel code, but probably can keep using it elsewhere.\r\n\r\n> > Make them compatible with wallet logging, which includes the wallet name in log messages\r\n>\r\n> The only thing needed here is renaming from `Printf` to `Info`...\r\n\r\nProbably something is lost in communication here, but the idea is to let wallet code use same LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(), LogWarning(), LogError() macros other code uses. It just adds a little formatting hook so the wallet name is automatically included when the log source is the wallet. This way full functionality of #29256 is available to the wallet and we can drop WalletLogPrintf and not have dedicated wallet logging functions.\r\n\r\n",

This narrowly scoped functionality allows use with v3-like topologies, and will be expanded at some point post-cluster mempool when diagram checks can be done efficiently against bounded cluster sizes.\r\n2) Replacement for single tx RBF(in a cluster size of up to two) against conflicts of up to cluster size two. `ImprovesFeerateDiagram` interface will have to change for this use-case, which is a future direction to solve certain pins and improve mempool incentive compatibility: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/ephemeral-anchors-and-mev/383#diagram-checks-fix-this-3\r\n\r\nAnd longer-term, this would be the proposed way we would compute incentive compatibility for all conflicts, post-cluster mempool.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "It is sometimes useful for the wallet to have keys that it can sign with but are not (initially) involved in any scripts, e.g. for setting up a multisig. Ryanofsky [suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1867721948) A `void(KEY)` descriptor which allows for a key to be specified, but produces no scripts. These can be imported into the wallet, and subsequently retrieved with `gethdkeys`. Additionally, `listdescriptors` will output these descriptors so that they can be easily backed up.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it easier for people to add HD keys to their wallet, and to generate a new one if they want to rotate their descriptors, an `addhdkey` RPC is also added. Without arguments, it will generate a new HD key and add it to the wallet via a `void(KEY)` descriptor. If provided a private key, it will construct the descriptor and add it to the wallet.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1866961865\r\n\r\nBased on #29130 as `gethdkeys` is useful for testing this.",

If larger, fail.\r\n3) The package rbf may not evict more than 100 transactions from the mempool(bip125 rule 5)\r\n4) The package is a single chunk\r\n5) Every directly conflicted mempool transaction is connected to at most 1 other in-mempool transaction (ie the cluster size of the conflict is at most 2).\r\n6) Diagram check: We ensure that the replacement is strictly superior, improving the mempool\r\n7) The total fee of the package, minus the total fee of what is being evicted, is at least the minrelayfee * size of the package (equivalent to bip125 rule 3 and 4)\r\n\r\nPost-cluster mempool this will likely be expanded to general package rbf, but this is what we can safely support today.\r\n",

(followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Noise\r\n\r\n- [ ] use EllSwift https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66, implemented in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/28\r\n- [ ] certificate signing issue: https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/717, fix in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/29\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [x] persist static key (needs #29229)\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [x] create `Sv2Transport` subclass similar to `V2Transport`: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/27\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n- [ ] adjust base58 encoding of authority public key https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/721\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [x] hold on to templates a bit after a block is found https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/709 (in case of race to prevent downstream crashes, though we still wouldn't relay it without additional changes)\r\n- [ ] hold on to template transactions even if the mempool drops them (for some time)\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

This could be useful in the future for using or testing these classes without having to instantiate any form of signal handling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587). It improves the kernel API and removes two modules from the kernel library.",

However, this would lead to the behavior of `ConnectNode` being unpredictable when the address was resolved to various ips (e.g. the address resolving to IPv4 and IPv6, but we only support one of them).\r\n\r\nThis patches the aforementioned behavior by going over all resolved IPs until a valid one is found or until we\r\nexhaust them.",

It also downgrades `Enqueuing` messages to the `Trace` level.\r\n\r\nIt makes it easier to run for a long time without excessive log file growth. This debug category is particularly useful for keeping track of problematic headers that were seen, the timing of reorgs, see also #27276.\r\n\r\nSince this PR touches `validationinterface.cpp` anyway, it also includes a commit to drop function names from log messages, since we now have `-logsourcelocations`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, though less important, I moved `[validation] Pre-allocating up to position 0x… in rev….dat` messages to blockstorage. This reduces the number of `[validation]` log messages further. ~to 3 per (normal) block.~\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volume of log messages [could also have been reduced](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27277#discussion_r1141375638) by changing the log level of these messages to `trace`. Doing so would prevent a whack-a-mole game of moving log messages to different categories. However in this case I think the change in log category would be justified even if it didn't have a big impact on noise. I.e. someone running with `-debug=mempool` would expect to see the `TransactionAddedToMempool` messages and someone running with `-debug=blockstorage` would perhaps be surprised to not see the `Pre-allocating` message.",

This PR skips flushing to disk those blocks that already have a known position in the datastore. Skipping this means that users can write-protect the `blk` files on disk which may be useful for security or even safely sharing that data between multiple bitcoind instances.\r\n\r\n`FindBlockPos()` may also flush the undo data file, but again this is skipped if the corresponding block position is known, like during the initial stage of a reindex when block data is being indexed. Once the block index is complete the validation mechanism will call `ConnectBlock()` which will save undo data at that time.\r\n\r\nThe call stack looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninit()\r\nThreadImport() <-- process fReindex flag\r\nLoadExternalBlockFile()\r\nAcceptBlock()\r\nSaveBlockToDisk()\r\nFindBlockPos()\r\nFlushBlockFile() <-- unnecessary if block is already on disk\r\n```\r\n\r\nA larger refactor of this part of the code was started by mzumsande here:  https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/tree/202207_refactor_findblockpos including this fix, reviewers can let me know if the changes should be combined.\r\n",

This is done in various places, such as `IsMine`, and helper functions for fetching a `ScriptPubKeyMan` and a `SolvingProvider`. This also has a bit of a performance impact on standard descriptor wallets, although less noticeable due to the small number of SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAs these functions are based on doing `IsMine` for each `ScriptPubKeyMan`, we can improve this performance by caching `IsMine` scriptPubKeys for all descriptors and use that to determine which `ScriptPubKeyMan` to actually use for those things. This cache is used exclusively and we no longer iterate the SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAlso added a benchmark for `IsMine`.",

          "title": "validation: log which peer sent us a header",
          "body": "Fixes #27744\r\n\r\nSince #27278 we log received headers. For compact blocks we also log which peer sent it (e5ce8576349d404c466b2f4cab1ca7bf920904b2), but not for regular headers. That required an additional refactor, which this PR provides.\r\n\r\nMove the logging from validation to net_processing.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces the number of log entries (under default configuration) per compact block header from 3 to 2: one for the header and one for the connected tip.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces a new helper method `LogBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a _compact block_ we call `LogBlockHeader` from the exact same place as where we previously logged. So that log message doesn't change. What does change is that we no longer _also_ log from `AcceptBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a regular header(s) message, _we only log the last one_. This is a change in behaviour because it was simpler to implement, but it's probably better anyway. It does mean that if a peer sends of a bunch of headers of which _any_ is invalid, we won't log it (here).\r\n\r\nLastly I expanded the code comment explaining why we log this. It initially only covered selfish mining, but we also care about peers sending us headers but not following up (see e.g. #27626).\r\n\r\nExample log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:21Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:23Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223098 tx=848176824 date='2023-06-05T13:11:49Z' progress=1.000000 cache=6.4MiB(54615txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z Saw new cmpctblock header hash=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223112 tx=848179461 date='2023-06-05T13:13:58Z' progress=1.000000 cache=7.2MiB(61275txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:41Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 peer=8\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:42Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 version=0x2db3c000 log2_work=94.223126 tx=848182944 date='2023-06-05T13:14:35Z' progress=1.000000 cache=8.0MiB(69837txo)\r\n```",

      "body": "> Agree, but the idea here is not to discard log messages, the idea just is to attach meaningful metadata to log messages so they can be filtered by component.\r\n\r\nFiltering is discarding.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to *find* log messages, that what's grep is for, and if you want to make it more fine-grained than \"hey this is an important log message/warning/error\", that's what `-logsourcelocations` is for.\r\n\r\nIf it's any help, I think it's better to think of the sections as not related to which section of the code they appear in so much (again, that's what `-logsourcelocations` is for), but as a subset of the \"debug\" part, in that they let you filter/discard various parts of the full debug log that you would get with `-debug=1`.\r\n \r\n> ```diff\r\n> -LogPrintLevel(BCLog::NET, BCLog::Level::Warning, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n> +LogWarning(log, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nThe current code there is noisy because it uses `LogPrintLevel`. The change you're actually making is:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-LogWarning(\"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n+LogWarning(log, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is adding characters, without adding any information to the reader.\r\n \r\n> It is true this sacrifices ability to grep by category constants in the source code, and maybe in your judgement that is an unacceptable cost?\r\n\r\nI think `LogDebug(BCLog::NET, \"oh no, it all went wrong\\n\")` is better than `LogDebug(m_log, \"oh no, it all went wrong)`. All the characters in the former are doing something useful; `m_log` in the latter isn't (if it weren't for macro magic, we'd write `m_log.Debug(\"...\")` instead, which would be okay at least). I don't think moving the category away from the line of code it's affecting is very useful; and if you want to group all the logs from an individual file together (the way putting `m_log{BCLog::NET}` at the top of the file/class does), then, again, that's what logsourcelocations is for...\r\n\r\n> But in my opinion, if we ever using same category constants in disparate parts of source code, or different category constants in the same part of the source code, it means source code is badly organized and we should fix that instead of resorting to a coping mechanism of searching for constants instead of searching by source path.\r\n\r\nThat's something that already happens: `BCLog::NET` is in timedata and headersync and banman and net and net_processing; `BCLog::VALIDATION` is in validation and validationinterface and flatfile (thought there was a pr to fix that one) and signet; `BCLog::MEMPOOL` is in txmempool, validation and net_processing. It doesn't mean the source code is badly organised, it means different parts of the source are generating related log messages.\r\n\r\n> In my experience, I've haven't used logging frameworks that have encouraged category constants to be scattered and mixed like this, and I don't think it is a good idea.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is anything here \"encouraging\" these categories to be scattered or mixed; most of them are specific to a small set of related files: TOR:torcontrol, HTTP:httpserver, ZMQ:zmq/*, WALLETDB:wallet/*, ESTIMATEFEE:policy/fees.cpp, SELECTCOINS:wallet/coinselection, REINDEX:validation, CMPCTBLOCK:blockencodings, RAND:random.cpp, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd you obviously have worked with code designed this way: that's how `LogPrint` has worked in this codebase since it was implemented in #3009.\r\n\r\n> Probably something is lost in communication here, but the idea is to let wallet code use same LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(), LogWarning(), LogError() macros other code uses.\r\n\r\nUpdating `TraceSqlCallback` to call `LogTrace` rather than `LogPrintf` would be an improvement as those messages would get categorised properly; but otherwise this seems like massive overkill just to avoid writing `\"[%s] ...\", walletname, ...`.\r\n\r\n> It just adds a little formatting hook so the wallet name is automatically included when the log source is the wallet. This way full functionality of #29256 is available to the wallet and we can drop WalletLogPrintf and not have dedicated wallet logging functions.\r\n\r\nA +190 -109 diff because you don't like a one-line wrapper function seems crazy to me.\r\n\r\nDo you have some reason to think there's large amounts of additional wallet debug logs that would be introduced if it didn't involve writing `[%s], walletname` or are there a bunch of the current unconditional `WalletLogPrintf` calls that should be silenced and only available when debugging is enabled?",

      "body": "@ajtowns, to try to steer this discussion in a more constructive direction, would it be possible for you to make a list of the biggest harms you believe this PR would cause if it were merged? And if you have ideas on how the harms you see could be avoided, while the problems I am trying to solve (see \"Problems this PR attempts to solve\" in the PR description) could be addressed, it would be really helpful to know about. Maybe the harms you see this PR causing and the problems this PR is trying to solve are in direct contradiction, but it's not obvious to me that this is the case, so maybe there is a way out of our disagreement here. In the meantime, I responded to your last message below.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29256#issuecomment-1899825975\r\n\r\n> Filtering is discarding.\r\n\r\nIt's really not. You can view logs into a text editor or log viewer and highlight categories of messages you are interested in while not discarding other messages.\r\n\r\nI am just trying to add some basic flexibility here. If you don't want to attach categories to log messages, you don't have to, you can write `LogWarning({}, \"uncategorizable warning\")`. The PR just makes the log macros consistently accept a source parameter, so code has flexibility to set a category, set a log destination, add metadata to log messages, control log formatting, do a combination of these things, or do none of these things.\r\n\r\n> ```diff\r\n> -LogWarning(\"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n> +LogWarning(log, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n> ```\r\n> which is adding characters, without adding any information to the reader.\r\n\r\nThis adds 5 characters, but also adds category information that was previously absent to the output. You can find examples of where the API changes in this PR increase verbosity, and examples where they decrease it, and I think there should be less verbosity on net. I also think some of this discussion around verbosity misses the bigger picture, and is a distraction from the actual goal of the PR, which is to add context to log messages, and give code that needs it control over logging behavior. But if making the log parameter optional is a requirement for you, it should be possible to implement that here and never increase verbosity in any case.\r\n\r\n> All the characters in the former are doing something useful; `m_log` in the latter isn't (if it weren't for macro magic, we'd write `m_log.Debug(\"...\")` instead, which would be okay at least).\r\n\r\nI agree `m_log.Debug(\"...\")` would be better than `LogDebug(m_log, \"...\")` but I don't understand why the former would be ok, but the latter is unacceptable. You definitely have much stronger opinions about verbosity than me, so maybe we can try to engage more constructively on this. I think on net, this PR should reduce verbosity, but maybe more improvements are possible that could alleviate your concerns.\r\n\r\n> I don't think moving the category away from the line of code it's affecting is very useful\r\n\r\nThat's ok, since allowing this was a side effect, not a major goal of this PR. But `LogDebug(m_log, \"debug message\")` can be easier to write and read than `LogDebug(BCLog::TXRECONCILIATION, \"debug message\")`, especially if the code has a lot of log prints and the category is repeated a lot. In any case, you aren't forced to choose one approach or the other. The PR allows both.\r\n\r\n> It doesn't mean the source code is badly organised, it means different parts of the source are generating related log messages.\r\n\r\nOk, we definitely disagree on how well the code is organized. IMO, `validation.cpp` doing `BCLog::MEMPOOL` prints is messed up. But this is a tangent. I think log sources should encourage better organization, but this PR does not force anything or break anything that works now.\r\n\r\n> I don't think there is anything here \"encouraging\" these categories to be scattered or mixed\r\n\r\nI don't want to make a big deal out of this, but just to clarify, I think the status quo where trace and debug macros require `BCLog::LogFlags` arguments and can't take source arguments makes it easier to mix up categories, intentionally and unintentionally. The alternative where source objects can be used for error/warning/info prints, not just debug/trace prints, and can tag everything with the same category should make it easier to be consistent if you want to be consistent (and not get in the way if you don't want to).\r\n\r\n> Updating `TraceSqlCallback` to call `LogTrace` rather than `LogPrintf` would be an improvement as those messages would get categorised properly; but otherwise this seems like massive overkill just to avoid writing `\"[%s] ...\", walletname, ...`.\r\n\r\nI don't see the massive overkill. This is a reasonable PR that adds documentation, tests, and doesn't change very much code. We don't want to require every individual wallet log print to include `\"[%s] ...\", walletname, ...` boilerplate for obvious reasons, I think. The problems with the `WalletLogPrintf` function are:\r\n\r\n1. It is only capable of logging at info level, does not provide a way to log at higher or lower levels.\r\n2. It evaluates its arguments unconditionally, so if it were extended to log at lower levels, it would either be inefficient or need to duplicate preprocessor code from logging.h to be as efficient.\r\n3. It is inconsistent with the rest of the codebase. It is nice if the same logging macros can be used everywhere, and the same features can be used everywhere. It also ensures logging is consistent within the wallet and only one logging API is used there.",

      "body": "> And if you have ideas on how the harms you see could be avoided, while the problems I am trying to solve (see \"Problems this PR attempts to solve\" in the PR description) could be addressed, \r\n\r\nI think the problem you are actually attempting to solve is [\"I, ryanofsky, find this weird and I don't like it\"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28318#discussion_r1450411706), and I don't think code changes are the way of solving that, any more than code changes are the right way to solve the problem \"Bitcoin is weird and I don't like it\". I think you're wrong, but you seem unwilling to consider changing your opinion, so I'm pretty doubtful this is going to be productive. However, in case I'm wrong:\r\n\r\n> These macros cannot be used directly in wallet code because wallet log prints are supposed to automatically attach wallet names to log messages.\r\n\r\nThe only cases where wallet names are automatically attached to log messages are in info level calls, which can be trivially dealt with by changing the existing wrapper to call `LogInfo`, and with an optional scripted diff renaming the wrapper as well.\r\n\r\n> These macros cannot be used at all in libbitcoinkernel code because they do not allow specifying a logger instance. \r\n\r\nThis, also, is not true: the assumption of these macros is that there is a global `BCLog::Logger` instance, which is already provided by `LogInstance()`. If we want to allow apps to configure libbitcoinkernel's logging in future, we could allow them to setup that global instance, or provide their own callbacks for it to use, in much the same way libevent allows you to setup callbacks. That's not something that needs changing.\r\n\r\n> > Filtering is discarding.\r\n> \r\n> It's really not. You can view logs into a text editor or log viewer and highlight categories of messages you are interested in while not discarding other messages.\r\n\r\nThat's not filtering, that's 'grepping'. If you don't want to filter, but just want to highlight, then, as I've said repeatedly, logsourcelocations is what you want; the only benefit categories have compared to that is that categories can be (and by default are) filtered/discarded. logsourcelocations gives you much more exact information, is precisely separated by source file as you want, works with every level of log message, and requires no code changes or ongoing development effort to support.\r\n\r\n> I am just trying to add some basic flexibility here. If you don't want to attach categories to log messages, you don't have to, you can write `LogWarning({}, \"uncategorizable warning\")`.\r\n\r\nIn that case you will not be able to use your log viewer to highlight that message when you're looking for it, which defeats your claimed goal. (Except, of course, you can select it for highlight, by looking for `[warning]` markers)\r\n\r\n> The PR just makes the log macros consistently accept a source parameter,\r\n\r\nCan you please try using the logsourcelocations option before replying again? I really don't see how it doesn't already do everything you want, but you've ignored it every time I've mentioned it.\r\n\r\n> > ```diff\r\n> > -LogWarning(\"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n> > +LogWarning(log, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n> > ```\r\n> > which is adding characters, without adding any information to the reader.\r\n\r\nThe reader of the source code, is who I'm referring to here.\r\n \r\n> > All the characters in the former are doing something useful; `m_log` in the latter isn't (if it weren't for macro magic, we'd write `m_log.Debug(\"...\")` instead, which would be okay at least).\r\n> \r\n> I agree `m_log.Debug(\"...\")` would be better than `LogDebug(m_log, \"...\")`\r\n\r\nI don't think `m_log.Debug()` would be better than `LogDebug` -- in my opinion having a global log instance is the right thing here, and both having multiple references to a global log instance or having multiple log instances that all then coordinate writing to a single log would be worse.\r\n\r\nAs I've already said, I think `m_log.SetCategory(NET); m_log.Debug(\"connected to foo\")` is much worse than `LogDebug(NET, \"connected to foo\")`. Having to keep more context/state in your head when you're looking at code makes things harder, and it tends to make tool use go from \"usually works\" to \"never works\" (eg, `grep -RIl 'Log.*NET'`).\r\n \r\n> > It doesn't mean the source code is badly organised, it means different parts of the source are generating related log messages.\r\n> \r\n> Ok, we definitely disagree on how well the code is organized. IMO, `validation.cpp` doing `BCLog::MEMPOOL` prints is messed up. But this is a tangent. I think log sources should encourage better organization, but this PR does not force anything or break anything that works now.\r\n\r\nvalidation.cpp is where we have the code for \"is this valid for the mempool\", because we thought the word \"valid\" was more important than the word \"mempool\" in that sentence. `BCLog::VALIDATION` on the other hand is limited to blocks and headers, allowing it to be much less noisy than anything that triggers for every transaction, like `BCLog::MEMPOOL`. None of that is any indication of whether the code is well or badly organised.\r\n\r\n> > I don't think there is anything here \"encouraging\" these categories to be scattered or mixed\r\n> \r\n> I don't want to make a big deal out of this, but just to clarify, I think the status quo where trace and debug macros require `BCLog::LogFlags` arguments and can't take source arguments makes it easier to mix up categories, intentionally and unintentionally.\r\n\r\nI think by \"source arguments\" you mean \"a context argument\", and there's no reason they couldn't -- you can write `LogDebug(m_log_category, \"stuff\");` right now just as easily as you could `LogDebug(m_log, \"stuff\");` after this PR. That would still be a bad idea, though, as having the name of the log category obvious in the code is helpful.\r\n \r\n> > Updating `TraceSqlCallback` to call `LogTrace` rather than `LogPrintf` would be an improvement as those messages would get categorised properly; but otherwise this seems like massive overkill just to avoid writing `\"[%s] ...\", walletname, ...`.\r\n> \r\n> I don't see the massive overkill.\r\n\r\nIf there's a way of getting 99% of the benefits with a +1-1 change, then a +300-200 change is overkill in general.\r\n\r\n> This is a reasonable PR that adds documentation, tests, and doesn't change very much code. We don't want to require every individual wallet log print to include `\"[%s] ...\", walletname, ...` boilerplate for obvious reasons, I think. The problems with the `WalletLogPrintf` function are:\r\n> \r\n>     1. It is only capable of logging at info level, does not provide a way to log at higher or lower levels.\r\n\r\nWhy do you think that is a problem? None of the other existing cases need to add walletname boilerplate. What wallet-specific event (if it's not wallet specific, it doesn't need to be tagged with a wallet name) shouldn't be unconditionally logged (if an event is affecting the thing that holds all your funds, isn't that one of the most important things to log)?\r\n\r\n>     2. It evaluates its arguments unconditionally, so if it were extended to log at lower levels, it would either be inefficient or need to duplicate preprocessor code from logging.h to be as efficient.\r\n\r\nThat it only logs at info level means it is unconditionally logged, so all the arguments are naturally unconditionally evaluated.\r\n\r\n>     3. It is inconsistent with the rest of the codebase.\r\n\r\nIt's inconsistent with your idea of how the codebase should be, but it's completely consistent with how the codebase actually is. Which is fine: changing the codebase to match better ideas is how you improve it. But things aren't going to improve if we can't recognise how things actually are in the first place.",

          "title": "Broadcast own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections",
          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNext step after this PR is done will be to have the wallet do the private broadcast as well, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11887 would have to be resolved.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

          "title": "wallet: optimize migration process, batch db transactions",
          "body": "Last step in a chain of PRs (#26836, #28894, #28987, #29403).\r\n\r\nThe initial benchmark conducted locally showed a ~65% processing time reduction, on a SSD.\r\nResults, from the very first benchmark, can be found at the end of the description.\r\n\r\n#### Detailed Description:\r\nThe current wallet migration process performs only individual db writes. Accessing disk to\r\ndelete all legacy records, clone and clean each address book entry for every created wallet,\r\ncreate each new descriptor (with their corresponding master key, caches and key pool), and\r\nalso clone and delete each transaction that requires to be transferred to a different wallet.\r\n\r\nThis work consolidates all individual disk writes into two batch operations. One for the descriptors\r\ncreation from the legacy data and a second one for the execution of the migration process itself.\r\nEfficiently dumping all the information to disk at once atomically at the end of each process.\r\n\r\nThis represent a speed up and also a consistency improvement. During migration, we either\r\nwant to succeed or fail. No other outcomes should be accepted. We should never leave a\r\npartially migrated wallet on disk and request the user to manually restore the previous wallet from\r\na backup (at least not if we can avoid it).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since db transactions relevant to the key pool generation were also batched, this work\r\nalso speeds up the regular wallet creation process.\r\n\r\n#### Note for Testers:\r\nThe first commit introduces a benchmark for the migration process. This one can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master to compare results pre and post changes.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the benchmark setup may take some time (~70 seconds here) due to the absence\r\nof a batching mechanism for the address generation process (`GetNewDestination()` calls). Which,\r\nI plan to address in a separate PR, just to not continue expanding this PR.\r\n\r\n————————————————————————\r\n\r\nBenchmark on master (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:-----------\r\n|   65,093,884,958.00 |                0.02 |    0.0% |     65.09 | `WalletMigration`\r\n\r\nBenchmark on this branch (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|   22,926,814,750.00 |                0.04 |    0.0% |     22.93 | `WalletMigration`",

          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. Compared to #28983 it introduces EllSwift in the handshake and fixes various bugs. I used that opportunity to change the branch name, which makes testing against [SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) slightly easier. There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #26812\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

Currently we log messages unconditionally that don't have a category. But this is mixing two separate things - facility and severity. I have always found this confusing.\r\n\r\nThey got it right decades ago with [syslog(3)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/syslog.3.html). Every log message has a facility and a severity. Because we don't want users to configure their systems in such a way as to dangerously omit important messages, then we don't provide a way to omit messages with higher severity than e.g. \"info\" or \"notice\". This is unrelated to the facility.\r\n\r\nIf some parts of this PR cause controversy, could it be reduced to the non-controversial things?",

Not locking cs_main while validating assumeutxo snapshots, so the node is responsive when the background chainstate download finishes.\r\n2. Deleting the background chainstate right away when it is no longer needed, instead of waiting until the next restart, which takes up extra disk space and slows down the next startup.",

I especially regret it you are \"sorry for touching this\", because #28318 is a real improvement, and your comments on this PR have made it better too, and motivated all the work and simplifications I've made to it since it was opened.",

My main criticism of what remains is:\r\n\r\n> > > > Can you please try using the `logsourcelocations` option before replying again? I really don't see how it doesn't already do everything you want, but you've ignored it every time I've mentioned it.\r\n\r\nI'll rephrase how I see things again for whatever that's worth:\r\n\r\n * being able to match a log entry with where it came from in the source is super valuable\r\n * `-logsourcelocations` does that automatically for us, which is far less effort than manually specifying a category, and by giving a specific filename and line number, does a far better job of it as well\r\n * the only reason to keep the manual categories around at all is for selectively enabling/disabling noisy logs\r\n * the only noisy logs we have are those in the debug and trace levels (anything else would be a bug)\r\n * having those be manually specified rather than automatic is a win, as it allows us to rearrange our source code without accidentally breaking the configs of users who've enabled some noisy logs\r\n * adding those categories for non-noisy log messages is just busy work: it doesn't make it easier to find the source location of the debug message than `-logsourcelocations` does, and it doesn't help reduce log noise because those log messages aren't noisy in the first place\r\n\r\nThe macros in #28318 pretty much fall out from that. I suppose an alternative would be to have `Log(INFO, \"foo\")` and `LogNoisy(DEBUG, NET, \"bar\")` or so.\r\n\r\nThere are probably things `logsourcelocations` is bad at; if so, why not improve it so the benefits hit everywhere automatically?\r\n\r\n> The PR allows the syntax you like and support it as a first-class usage!\r\n\r\nI think specifying a category sometimes and not others depending on who happened to author that section of the code is a terrible idea. But I mean, it's not any more terrible than having \"LogPrint\" and \"LogPrintf\" having significantly different behaviour, so it's not like it's a disaster.

There's a valid disagreement there, isn't there? Can't we discuss it like engineers and work out what actual tradeoffs are lurking behind the intuition/gut feels? I've tried to spell out my reasoning both [before](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28318#issuecomment-1702318968) and after the PR got merged as well as having brought it up at the [irc meeting](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2023-08-31.html#l-384) to try to trigger discussion, but the response has just to reiterate the disagreement without any analysis or engagement with the reasoning that I've offered for doing it this way? Why? That makes no sense to me. I'm willing to be convinced I've made a mistake; but someone has to show me where I made the mistake, or at least do a show of hands that the majority prefers something else.\r\n\r\nI mean, am I incorrect in reading the previous two comments as \"here are the reasons I think this solution make sense: A, B, C, D, E, F\" and \"okay, that's nice, I'm going to completely ignore them, besides, X and Y are still important\"? Other than \"uh, okay, I guess I know when I'm not wanted\", how else am I meant to take it? What's the chance a response addressing X and Y will just also get equally ignored?\r\n\r\n(FWIW, I'd strongly contend that just declaring things should be such-and-such a way without being willing either talk through the tradeoffs and maybe find some mutually preferable solution, or to happily say \"oh well, not what I'd consider perfect, but not so bad, let's press on!\" is a pretty major contributor to things not progressing very fast. I can understand that habit in bitcoin broadly -- you explain why BTC is great and people shrug or call it a ponzi, and the only thing you can do is wait to be proven right, so you start just skipping straight to the final step -- but I don't understand it in the context of code changes at all...)\r\n\r\nAnyway, on to X and Y:\r\n\r\n>  (1) let libitcoinkernel applications call validation functions and control which `Logger` object they write to, \r\n\r\nDoing that meaningfully means changing all the logging in all the bitcoin-kernel related modules (eg validation, mempool, blockstorage, scheduler, ...) to explicitly specify a logger rather than using the global functions, which seems like a lot of pointless busy work? I can't imagine why we'd want to support having multiple bitcoin-kernel instances in a single executable logging to different loggers; if someone wants to do that, it seems easy enough to just launch two separate processes.\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to just have applications manipulate the global logger directly, which is how things already work, perhaps turning it into an atomic unique_ptr or similar and making many of its function virtual to allow overriding?. I'm just not really sure what the problem here is that's worth fixing; we already buffer log messages until `StartLogging` is called, and libbitcoin-kernel continuing to have a global logger instance seems simple and efficient for both us and any potential users of the library.\r\n\r\n(If we did want to do that anyway for some reason, then waiting until `std::source_location` is available would let us use `log.Debug(...)` syntax via template functions rather than having to use a macro and writing `LogDebug(log, ...)`. So rushing this change now seems bad even if the goal makes sense in some way I don't see)\r\n\r\n(The phrasing in the OP is currently \"The new macros cannot be used in libbitcoinkernel code because they do not allow specifying a logger instance.\" but that seems just false -- there's a bunch of LogInfo() calls in kernel/*.cpp already, and all the LogPrintf and LogPrint calls in validation are just aliases of LogInfo and LogDebug)\r\n\r\n> and (2) allow code like wallet code and index code to easily include additional metadata in log messages (wallet names and index names) while using convenient LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(), LogWarning(), and LogError() macros.\r\n\r\nWe could do that simply by renaming `WalletLogPrintf` to `WalletLogInfo`, with behaviour no worse than today. There just isn't currently a need for non-info-level logs that report the wallet's name (which makes sense: in general ops on a wallet are important enough to be an \"INFO\" event).\r\n\r\nHaving `WalletLogPrintf` (or whatever) wrap around `LogInfo` sucks a bit, because it means `-logsourcelocations` reports the wrapper location rather than the caller. But a fix for that will be easy \"real-soon-now\" (#29077) when we can use `std::source_location`.\r\n\r\nChanging `wallet/sqlite`'s `TraceSqlCallback` to use `LogTrace` instead of `LogPrintf` is something we could do today that would improve things by making the output correctly indicate that it's trace-level rather than info-level, and be correctly annotated with the debug category that enables it to be logged. Again, that only needs a few characters changed, not a fundamental revamp.\r\n\r\nHere's a [patchset](https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commits/202405-walletlog/) that does those wallet changes:  it's a one line change for the trace logging, and two scripted diffs. Easy to do, easy to review, and \"allows the wallet code to easily include its metadata in log messages while using convenient LogInfo macros/functions\". If we want to improve things further (like using `std::source_location` when it's available or introducing some wallet-specific warnings or debug messages) we could still easily do that in the future.",
