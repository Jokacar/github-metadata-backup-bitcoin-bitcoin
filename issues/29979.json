    "title": "\"Migrate Wallet\" is unclear to translators",
    "body": "Going through translations, I'm seeing things that suggest \"migration\" is being misinterpreted in the sense of animals migrating (moving/relocating). We could clarify with translator comments (assuming translators actually see them), but that won't help if non-native English speakers are using Bitcoin Core in English, so maybe a better approach is to come up with another word for this?",
