    "body": "These are the simple (and hopefully obviously correct) copies that can be moves instead.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30094#issuecomment-2108751842\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, there are hundreds of places where we copy UniValues needlessly. It should be the case that moves are always preferred over copies, so there should be no downside to these changes.\r\n\r\n@willcl-ark, however, noticed that memory usage may increase in some cases. Logically this makes no sense to me. The only plausible explanation imo is that because the moves are faster, more ops/second occur in some cases.\r\n\r\nThis list of moves was obtained by changing the function signatures of the UniValue functions to accept only rvalues, then compiling and fixing them up one by one. There still exist many places where copies are being made. These can/should be fixed up, but weren't done here for the sake of doing the easy ones first.\r\n\r\nI ran these changes through clang-tidy with `performance-move-const-arg` and `bugprone-use-after-move` and no bugs were detected (though that's obviously not to say it can be trusted 100%).\r\n\r\nAs stated above, there are still lots of other less trivial fixups to do after these including:\r\n- Using non-const UniValues where possible so that moves can happen\r\n- Refactoring code in order to be able to move a UniValue without introducing a use-after-move\r\n- Refactoring functions to accept UniValues by value rather than by const reference",

      "body": "> Could this be a case for a clang-tidy plugin?\r\n\r\nI think the ideal thing to do for types that are potentially expensive to copy is to disable implicit copies, but provide explicit `T Copy() const` and `void CopyFrom(const T&)` methods so copies can be made where needed. (There was a `DISABLE_IMPLICIT_COPIES` macro proposed in #24641 that tried to do this, but it didn't seem possible to generalize the implementation so we never added it.) It think it would be probably be reasonable to allow univalue to be explicitly but not implicitly copied, but I'm sure @theuni would have a better intuition.",
