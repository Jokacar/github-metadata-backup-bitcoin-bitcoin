Furthermore, it could be extended to be revivable after changes to the underlying layer happened. (As opposed to be single-use)",

It doesn't make sense to have more than 1 iteration per eval, because the speed per coin as part of a large flush is a more relevant metric then how often you can flush 1 coin. At the same time I didn't want the benches to use up too much  RAM if someone sets `-scaling` to high number.\r\n\r\nTo test a bigger cache increase `N_CACHE_SCALE=1`. The cache is about 40 MB by default, try `N_CACHE_SCALE=100` for more realistic scenarios, but note that test needs ~3x RAM.\r\n\r\nI'm doing a few things the bench framework doesn't seem designed for. Would like some feedback before I refactor it in the wrong direction:\r\n\r\n- [ ] share code with test framework (should support `--disable-test`?)\r\n- [ ] clean up stuff between evals; e.g. I need to reset the coin cache for `CCoinsViewCacheAddCoinFresh` and `CCoinsViewCacheFlush`\r\n- [ ] disable scaling iterations\r\n- [ ] add a memory-scaling argument\r\n- [ ] allow pausing the clock between iterations; e.g. to generate test coins on the fly rather in bulk before the run ",

          "body": "This introduces versions of `GetScriptOp`, `EvalScript`, and `VerifyScript` that operate on scripts represented by `Span<const unsigned char>`. This makes it possible to use different representation types for scripts, as Spans can be used to refer to scripts stored in any continuous fashion in memory, regardless of the container.\r\n\r\nThis is also a step towards reducing the consensus-criticalness of CScript, but not entirely. The interpreter code still uses CScript internally for a few purposes (notably `DecodeOP_N`, and `operator<<`).\n\nLonger term, the goal is removing the need for all scripts to share the same representation. Currently `CScript` is a prevector with 28 preallocated bytes - a choice we need because it's favorable for scriptPubKeys in the UTXO cache, but it's pretty terrible for storing scriptSigs. With this change, separate (or even custom) data structures can be used for UTXO scriptPubKeys, and scriptPubKeys/scriptSigs in transactions. One possibility for the latter is storing all scripts in a transaction concatenated in a single allocated area, rather than using separate allocations for each.",

          "body": "Rebase of #12138:\r\n\r\n> This adds a `setBlockIndexHeaderCandidates` which mimics `setBlockIndexCandidates` and is\r\nThe set of all leaf `CBlockIndex` entries with` BLOCK_VALID_TREE` (for itself and all ancestors) and\r\nas good as our current tip or better. Entries here are potential future candidates for insertion\r\ninto `setBlockIndexCandidates`, once we get all the required block data. Thus, entries here\r\nrepresent chains on which we should be actively downloading block data.\r\n>\r\n> Note that we define \"as good as our current tip or better\" slightly differently here than in\r\nsetBlockIndexCandidates - we include things which will have a higher nSequence (but have the\r\nsame chain work) here, but do not include such entries in setBlockIndexCandidates. This is\r\nbecause we prefer to also download towards chains which have the same total work as our current\r\nchain (as an optimization since a reorg is very possible in such cases).\r\n>\r\n> Note that, unlike `setBlockIndexCandidates`, we only store \"leaf\" entries here, as we are not as\r\naggressively prune-able (`setBlockIndexCandidates` are things which we can, and usually do, try to connect immediately, and thus entries dont stick around for long). Thus, it may be the case that\r\n`chainActive.Tip()` is NOT in `setBlockIndexHeaderCandidates`.\r\n>\r\n> Additionally, unlike setBlockIndexCandidates, we are happy to store entries which are not\r\nconnectable due to pruning here.\r\n>\r\n> This is useful as it (finally) disconnects net_processing logic from the \"store on disk\" logic in validation.cpp. More importantly, it represents what you'd need from the consensus logic to implement a spv-first sync mode, as this provides a best-header which will follow invalidity - always pointing to the best-possible header even after block(s) are found to be invalid.\r\n\r\nNot included:\r\n* #13912 (test framework change)\r\n* #13930 (source code comment which is useful on its own)\r\n* a9db3dada0119c183d16627805e90c4dbca05c6a \"Do not unlock cs_main in ABC unless we've actually made progress\": already merged as part of #13023\r\n\r\nNoteble rebase changes:\r\n* `pindex_was_in_chain` is still needed due to  #12431, in order to notify the gui about a new block tip, only if the active chain was modified\r\n* `qt/clientmodel.cpp` changed significantly, because things were moved to `interfaces/node.cpp`\r\n* updated `ProcessNewBlock` bench\r\n\r\nI added an additional commit, because the new `!fHasMoreOrSameWork && !parent_of_header_candidate` check in `AcceptBlock` can cause `submitblock` (modified in #13439) to mistakingly believe the block is a duplicate.\r\n\r\nAdded debug log statements to `rpc_preciousblock.py` that helped me figure out the above issue.",

          "title": "Stricter & More Performant Invariant Checking in CheckBlock",
          "body": "This PR supersedes #14387 and is an alternative to #14397. \r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nPreviously, \"no duplicate inputs\" was checked on a per transaction basis, with this PR, they are checked block wide. This PR also checks that long chains are in valid order, which was previously implicitly checked only. The resulting code is also more performant. \r\n\r\n# Benefits\r\n1) **Stricter Invariants** This PR checks stricter properties. Before this PR, a block might pass checkblock with duplicate inputs spent across transactions and invalid longchain order. Enforcing stricter invariants in CheckBlock helps us guard against potential errors in later sections of the code and opens up the door to new optimizations, parallelizations, or simplifications in the application of transactions in a block. For instance, we could create all new UTXOS in parallel and then spend all inputs in parallel.\r\n2) **Better Performance**  This checker is 6.5x faster on the duplicate inputs benchmark, and 1.1x faster on a more general test.\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\nDuplicateInputs, 5, 10, 0.334544, 0.00665873, 0.00671868, 0.00669463\r\nDeserializeAndCheckBlockTest, 5, 160, 2.17535, 0.00267973, 0.00273858, 0.00272915\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n```\r\nDuplicateInputs, 5, 10, 0.0513754, 0.00100089, 0.00105766, 0.00102823\r\nDeserializeAndCheckBlockTest, 5, 160, 1.97574, 0.00245479, 0.00248704, 0.00246725\r\n```\r\n3) **Better Complexity** The time complexity of the algorithm is E[O(N)], compared to E[O(N log(N)]. It also, in theory uses much less memory in the worst case (constant 300k) compared to O(N) (i.e., 1MB) worst case for the previous algorithm. Furthermore, the number of actual hash comparisons is substantially reduced, which contributes a big constant factor. The analysis is given in more detail in the PR which justifies the constants selected.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Potential Risks & Redresses\r\n\r\nIn this section I'll try to exhaustively go through the various risks of this PR.\r\n\r\n1) **Probabilistic Algorithms are Confusing**. Should the PCG based hashing algorithm (or other probabilistic aspects) be broken in this code, then an attacker could theoretically cause a block to take O(N^2) time to validate. One way to de-risk this issue would be to, upon erroneous collision, fall back to checking against a std::set which would have O(n log n) worst-case behavior (the existing runtime). In general, the theory behind PCGs makes it unlikely that an attacker could predict collisions across the network because each PCG is salted individually (random seed xor'd in) and started with a different increment (the increment includes the output's n, and the seed is the 64 bit hash value -- this prevents adversary from using the output's n to generate collisions). Therefore, a spurious collision on one instance should have an exceedingly small probability of colliding on another. Perhaps there are further ways to harden this hash scheme while maintaining performance. In any case, the block still validates, just more slowly.\r\n2) **Code Complexity**. Should the code be simply incorrect (e.g., not actually checking that duplicate inputs are not present somehow) then unintended inflation could occur. This is always a risk with any change. I believe the stricter invariant checking justifies this change as reducing likelihood of bugs long term, as this protects sensitive code in block application from encountering certain types of invalid blocks based on sequential application of transactions.\r\n3) **Block Size dependency**. Technically this algorithm degrades in expected performance the more transactions are in a block, which may make it more difficult to increase block sizes. Fortunately, should block sizes ever be increased, the hash table size can be increased too (e.g. a 1MB table would support 4MB blocks easily).\r\n4) **Loss of WTXID caching of duplicate input checks**. It has been proposed WTXIDs could cache that they don't have duplicate inputs. I don't see WTXID caching this property as a really useful thing to cache because it needs to be checked at the block level across all transactions anyways. Further, the use of PCG for hashing makes the performance overhead negligible compared to a cache lookup.\r\n5) **Testing Coverage Difficulty** Because the algorithm fails infrequently, it's difficult to write a test that covers the case where the algorithm sees a spurious collision and the continues checking. This could be fixed by templating the Invariant function to allow for a biased PCG implementation which only generates collisions.\r\n6) **Changed failure messages** Because the algorithm checks more invariants at once and detects them in a different order than before, clients relying on an exact reject reason may be confused. Clients should already not rely on exact reject reasons, so I don't believe this has a ramification.",
