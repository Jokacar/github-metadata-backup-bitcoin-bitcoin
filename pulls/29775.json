    "body": "To supplement the [ongoing conceptual discussion about a testnet reset](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/9bL00vRj7OU/m/9yCPo3uUBwAJ) I have drafted a move to v4 including a fix to the difficulty adjustment mechanism, which was part of the motivation that started the discussion.\r\n\r\nConceptual considerations:\r\n- The conceptual discussion about doing a testnet4 or softforking the fix into testnet3 is outside of the scope of this PR and I would ask reviewers to contribute their opinions on this on the ML instead. However, I am happy to adapt this PR to a softfork change on testnet3 if there is consensus for that instead.\r\n- The difficulty adjustment fix suggested here touches the `CalculateNextWorkRequired` function and uses the same logic used in `GetNextWorkRequired` to find the last previous block that was not mined with difficulty 1 under the exceptionf. An alternative fix briefly mentioned on the mailing list by Jameson Lopp would be to \"restrict the special testnet minimum difficulty rule so that it can't be triggered on the block right before a difficulty retarget\". That would also fix the issue but I find my suggestion here a bit more elegant.",

I have also added an extremely simple unit test.\r\n\r\n~~In some [draft by sjors from 5 years ago](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/4485700f93fb609ee292964fa70e89af88ecdd55) I saw that he took the chance to rename the variable to `m_chain_num_tx`. I didn’t do this now because `nChainTx` isn’t terrible IMO, just outdated, but happy to do this if people think it’s valuable while I touch these lines.~~ This is included now.\r\n\r\nThere was also talk about a memory-optimized solution for this by combining nChainTx and nTx: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29258#issuecomment-1929388354 I tried out an approach to this here: https://github.com/fjahr/bitcoin/commit/b9382041e541569a2b8ec7ed1f7fb10aa602277f (patch is on top of the changes here), still rough, requires more security checks and cleanup of docs but it works (tests pass) and I am happy to take this route if it’s preferred.",

          "title": "Stratum v2 Template Provider (take 3)",
          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. Compared to #28983 it introduces EllSwift in the handshake and fixes various bugs. I used that opportunity to change the branch name, which makes testing against [SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) slightly easier. There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #26812\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

In other words, the valid block producer likely did use `getblocktemplate` around the same time and did not experience an issue.\r\n\r\nIt's also clear by looking at [Mempool.Space](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000004e0ec4f27bd3347381e8e19ed98d7f918e8c1c292ae97) that the valid block excluded many large bare multisig transactions. Those transactions paid more than enough in fees to be included, but we would have excluded them due to running out of sigops.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in `BlockAssembler::addPackageTxs` and `TestPackage` we simply don't add a package to the block if it doesn't fit the remaining weight or sigops. Custom block construction software might not do that. I initially though they might have forgotten to check SegWit related sigops, but that seems unlikely given that they were only off by 3 in both blocks.\r\n\r\nI suspect their mistake was to not count the number of sigops in the coinbase: it pays to legacy P2PKH which uses 4 sigops. Our code reserves 400 sigops for the coinbase, so would not have caused this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n_Update 2024-01-09: I dropped the extra debug fields mentioned here_\r\n\r\nAnyway, while checking our code I added a few extra fields to the block statistics of~ `getblocktemplate`:\r\n\r\n* `sigops`: total sigops for the block excluding the coinbase\r\n* `coinbase_reserved_sigops`: how many sigops we reserve for the coinbase (400)\r\n* `weightlimit`\r\n* `coinbase_reserved_weight`\r\n\r\n~I added a belt and suspenders check for the sigops limit in the RPC code.~ (_update 2024-01-09: dropped_) Note that we already check it when adding packages to a block _and_ in `TestBlockValidity`.\r\n\r\n**Segwit**\r\n\r\n~I also removed the need to set `{\"rules\": \"!segwit\"}`, the generation of pre-segwit blocks, and the test code that checks activation.~ _update 2023-08-18: commit removed_",

      "body": "When resetting a test chain, it is also important to consider the script interpreter coverage of the current chain. Test chains are (usually) the first place to go to, to test new script primitives and protocols, as well as consensus deployments. The existing chain thus serves as a test for consensus implementations, apart from basic unit test vectors. It would be good to think how to preserve the test vectors in the chain. See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11739#issuecomment-346515145 . Or if it is not needed, it would be good to say so. Maybe https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/blob/main/unit_test_data/script_assets_test.json already covers a good portion?\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, testnet is the only public chain where anyone can submit a nonstandard transaction from their laptop. Recall that policy is enforced on all networks equally (see commit e1dc15d69061e69351c72907444e8ded0ac7c88c), so getting a non-mempool transaction into a block is only possible for a miner, or by cooperating with a miner. So if the difficulty hack is removed completely, anyone wishing to submit a transaction would have to go purchase and set up mining hardware, or find a miner willing to accept the transaction. Not saying what is the best approach here, just saying that the effects should be considered and a change be done intentionally.",

I am experimenting with some of the proposals from the mailing list and so I added Andres Poelstra's suggested difficulty adjustment with 6h/1M from here: https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/9bL00vRj7OU/m/kFPaQCzmBwAJ\r\n\r\n> Probably we should support tracking both testnet3 and the new testnet4 for some time. Making the new code conditional on a different chain param that's only set for testnet4 would probably be the easiest way of accomplishing that?\r\n\r\nUpdated the code to introduce T4 (`-testnet4`) and keep T3 in place but give some deprecation warning when it's used. I guess we would keep this in place for 1 or 2 releases and then remove T3 and then let `-testnet` run T4.\r\n\r\nI am using the Genesis block hash to distinguish between the two testnets. There may be cleaner solutions but I think this is ok since it would be only temporary until T3 is removed.\r\n\r\n> Moreover, testnet is the only public chain where anyone can submit a nonstandard transaction from their laptop.\r\n\r\nIs it really realistic that someone with just their CPU would be able to mine a block with their non-standard tx on the current testnet? If the bug isn't active currently they would need to wait for it to become active and that could take weeks, right? And when it becomes active I would imagine the miner who found the first block in the difficulty=1 series just blasts the network and the CPU miner still has no chance to get a block in between. \r\n\r\nWe could revert #28354 for testnet4 if this is a feature that matters to users. Is it too much to ask that people use `testmempoolaccept` or run their own testnet node with `-acceptnonstdtxn=0` when they want to test standardness of their tx? I would say no. And I don't see another option to solve this on layer 1 if we assume nobody changes the defaults.\r\n\r\n> It would be good to think how to preserve the test vectors in the chain.\r\n\r\nInteresting thought. I think once there is consensus to do T4 we will find a creative solution for this. Cool would be to convert this coverage to fuzzing coverage somehow but I am not sure if that's realistic or worth the effort. Otherwise, we could write a program that looks at all the different scripts that exist on T3 and replays them on T4 or if we can compress them somehow like by filtering everything that doesn't add coverage, then we turn it into a unit test that replays the interesting scripts.",

      "body": "Since some people consider the blockstorms an interesting feature of Testnet3, it might be interesting to only raise the difficulty of the delayed block exception to 100,000 instead of 1,000,000. This would allow the network to return to the organic difficulty in fewer difficulty periods and slow down the blockstorms but not remove the feature altogether. My understanding is that this would correspond roughly a tenth of one S9 mining on the network, so if no one had mined for a while, a single S9 could restart the network with ~60 s blocks, but wouldn’t churn out thousands of blocks per second.\r\n\r\nOnly allowing lower difficulty blocks after 6 hours could easily make testnet useless for extended periods, if someone put several ASICs on testnet for a while, it might prevent other users from getting confirmations for up to 6 hours. I could see an increase from the twenty minute rule to maybe an hour, but more seems counter to why the rule was introduced in the first place.",

All you have to do is to set the time +20min and mine a block on your laptop. If you don't want to try it yourself, you can come by to watch it on my laptop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Since some people consider the blockstorms an interesting feature of Testnet3\r\n\r\nAfter a quick chat with @murchandamus, an alternative fix would be to require the pre-retarget block to have the \"correct\" difficulty, so that all retarget periods are organic. The +20min hack would remain to allow a CPU to mine a few blocks, if needed, however, a block storm would be naturally limited by the +120h cut-off rule. This would limit the block storms to small block \"gusts\", which seems good enough to make everyone happy?",
