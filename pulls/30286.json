    "body": "Part of cluster mempool: #30289 \r\n\r\nDepends on #30126, and was split off from it.\r\n\r\nThis improves the candidate search algorithm introduced in the previous PR with a variety of optimizations.\r\n\r\nThe resulting search algorithm largely follows Section 2 of [How to linearize your cluster](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/how-to-linearize-your-cluster/303#h-2-finding-high-feerate-subsets-5), though with a few changes:\r\n* Connected component analysis is performed inside the search algorithm (creating initial work items per component for each candidate), rather than once at a higher level. This duplicates some work but is significantly simpler in implementation.\r\n* No ancestor-set based presplitting inside the search is performed; instead, the `best` value is initialized with the best topologically valid set known to the LIMO algorithm before search starts: the better one out of the highest-feerate remaining ancestor set, and the highest-feerate prefix of remaining transactions in `old_linearization`.\r\n* Work items are represented using an included set *inc* and an undefined set *und*, rather than included and excluded.\r\n* Potential sets *pot* are not computed for work items with empty *inc*.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, the only missing optimization from that post is bottleneck analysis; my thinking is that it only really helps with clusters that are already relatively cheap to linearize (doing so would need to be done at a higher level, not inside the search algorithm).\r\n",

I'll investigate a bit more, and if not significant, drop them from this PR.\r\n",

      "body": "> I'm surprised at the lack of (significant) per-iteration time reduction for:\r\n>\r\n> * clusterlin: reduce computation of unnecessary pot sets (optimization)\r\n> * clusterlin: avoid recomputing potential set on every split (optimization)\r\n> * clusterlin: avoid jump ahead in unmodified pot sets (optimization)\r\n\r\nI have dropped the 2nd and 3rd, due to inconclusive evidence that they help. The 1st one I have kept; my belief is that it in fact does not improve the worst case, but it is also has very low cost even when it doesn't do anything. The 2nd and 3rd do have a cost if ineffective (as shown by @glozow's and my benchmarks). Reasoning:\r\n\r\n* **reduce computation of unnecessary pot sets**: I don't believe this affects the worst case. My conjecture is that worst cases are ones where knowing the best candidate set up front does not change the number of iterations requires (i.e., all search tree subtrees either fail immediately, or need to be fully explored because they appear to be potential best ones until the very end). In these subtrees, this optimization doesn't do anything, because its only effect is reducing computation in work items that are doomed to fail soon after anyway, and if my conjecture is true, such branches don't exist in the first place in worst case situations. Still, due to the low cost, I've left it in.\r\n* **avoid recomputing potential set on every split**: this optimization was based on a belief that a significant amount of time would be spent recomputing the same `pot` subset after every split. With some more investigation, (hard) clusters exist where this change is a net improvement and ones where it is a net degradation (found through a custom fuzz test that maximizes or minimizes the number of `pot` addition steps minus the cost of updating `pot` in `split_fn`, not an actual benchmark). The per-iteration potential gains seem higher than the per-iteration potential degrations, but the largest absolute losses are with close-to-worst clusters, while the largest absolute gains are with significantly simpler clusters, which is weak evidence that it may hurt the worst case more than it helps. I think this will need analysis with real-world clusters to see actual impact, which may be easier once the cluster mempool project is further along. I've dropped it for this reason.\r\n* **avoid jump ahead in unmodified pot sets**: does not make sense without the previous change, so I also dropped it.\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell \r\n\r\n> Though there may be other patterns which are a worst case even more worse than the particular lattice used for testing without those optimizations? If you've been searching for worst case examples for a long time with those optimizations in place you may have missed cases that would be worse without them. No?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely; even the apparent worst-case complexity $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{2^n})$ is just a conjecture - it's possible that clusters exist which have up to $\\mathcal{O}(2^{n-1})$ complexity, and if so, a lot of empirical evidence that's been used to guide this development would go out the window. But given that I came up with it in an attempt to reduce a pattern which I incorrectly though would be very common, there isn't much justification to have it.",

      "body": "@instagibbs @glozow Let me try giving an explanation here. If this helps you, I'll rework it into a comment in the code.\r\n\r\nThink of the set of transactions in every work items as falling within one of four classes (roughly from \"more likely to be included\" to \"less likely to be included\"):\r\n* **I**: definitely included transactions, (= `item.inc`).\r\n* **U**: undecided transactions that may or may not end up being included (= `item.und`), subdided in:\r\n  * **UH**: possibly included, and including any of them will definitely increase the included set's feerate (even when other lower-fee UH transactions are included too) (=`item.pot - item.inc`, =`item.und & item.pot`).\r\n  * **UL**: possibly included, but including it is not guaranteed to increase the included set's feerate (=`item.und - item.pot`)\r\n* **E**: definitely excluded transactions, (= `todo - item.inc - item.und`).\r\n\r\nIn other words, `item.pot` is I+UH and `item.und` is U=UH+UL. Further, I is always topological, as is I+U. I+UH however may be non-topological.\r\n\r\nNow let's consider what happens in an inclusion branch (i.e., the call to `add_fn` for adding the split transaction and its ancestors):\r\n1. We start with a parent object which has a given I, UH, UL, E (assume I is non-empty; I=empty is a special case that has separate logic in several places).\r\n2. A split transaction t is chosen from U=UH+UL (=`item.und`).\r\n3. anc(t) are moved from UH+UL to I (this is done inside `split_fn`, in the invocation of `add_fn`).\r\n4. anc(t) will always include at least one UL transaction (*), and because of that the feerate of I may have gone down. If so, it is possible that more transactions can be moved from UL to UH. This is done inside `add_fn`, in the `for (auto pos : (imp & und) - pot.transactions) {` loop. \r\n5. Because of the changes to I and UH above, it is possible that there is now a new topologically-valid subset of I+UH that isn't already entirely in I, so it can be moved to I (jump ahead). This can be due to UH entries added in (4) **or due to I entries added in (3).**. This is done in `add_fn`, in the `for (auto pos : consider_inc) {` loop.\r\n7. If I now has the best feerate ever, remember it.\r\n8. Construct a new work item with the resulting I,UH,UL,E, unless UH+UL is empty (which is always the case if UL is empty, **) because then no more splits can take place.\r\n\r\nCompare this to what happens in an exclusion branch:\r\n1. Same\r\n2. Same\r\n3. desc(t) are moved from UH+UL to E and **I does not change**.\r\n4. desc(t) may include a UH transaction, and because of that it is possible that more transactions can be moved from UL to UH.\r\n5. Because of the above, it is possible that there are new topologically-valid subsets of I+UH now that can be moved to I. **This can only be due to UH entries added in (4).**\r\n6. Same\r\n7. Same\r\n\r\nThe bold parts correspond to `reconsider_pot`. In the inclusion branch, UL transactions moved to UH may result in existing UH transactions becoming part of a topologically-valid subset, so UH needs to be reconsidered. In an exclusion branch I does not change in (3), and so only new UH transactions added in (4) need to be considered for moving to I. Now, if that happens (something moves from UH to I due to jump ahead), it may be that what was in UH before becomes eligible to move as well, but doing so does not seem to affect the performance or number of iterations the algorithm needs.\r\n\r\n(*) The jump ahead is exactly what guarantees that anc(t) always includes a UL transaction. If anc(t) was entirely within UH, it would be topologically valid, and thus the parent work item's jump ahead step would have moved it to I already.\r\n\r\n(**) Same reason: if UL is empty, then the entirety if I+UH is topologically valid, and thus would have been moved to I entirely in the jump ahead. Thus, UL empty implies UH is also empty.",

If anc(t) was entirely within UH, it would be topologically valid, and thus the parent work item's jump ahead step would have moved it to I already.\r\n\r\nHowever I'm still having trouble with this part:\r\n\r\n> Compare this to what happens in an exclusion branch ...\r\n> 4. desc(t) may include a UH transaction, and because of that it is possible that more transactions can be moved from UL to UH.\r\n> 5. Because of the above, it is possible that there are new topologically-valid subsets of I+UH now that can be moved to I. This can only be due to UH entries added in (4).\r\n\r\nIt seems true that only the entries added in (4) can cause jump-aheads. However, I'm not convinced that existing `pot` transactions cannot be jump-aheadable. For instance, it's possible that we added a new tx that is the parent of a tx that was already in `pot`.\r\n\r\nI added an `assert(anc.Overlaps(elem.und - elem.pot.transactions))` in `split_fn`, right before we call `add_fn` for the inclusion branch in order to check that \"jump ahead guarantees that anc(t) always includes a UL transaction\". The assertion hit, and essentially what I saw was:\r\n\r\n1. Going into a split, we had a really high pot feerate, which included tx `C`.\r\n2. For the exclusion branch, desc(t) included lots of high feerate transactions which lowered the pot feerate. `C` is still in pot. At the start of this `add_fn`, we add tx `P` to pot, since its feerate is now high enough.\r\n3. `P` is part of `consider_inc`, and is added to `inc` in the jump-ahead.\r\n4. `C`, which a child of `P`, would be good because anc(C) is a topological subset of `pot`, but is skipped because `reconsider_pot=false`\r\n5. Later, we split on `C`. `C` is part of UH, not UL, which hits the assert. anc(C) = C which is in UH, but it wasn't added to `inc` during a jump-ahead. This is because `C` was added to UH when its ancestor `P` was considered UL, and `reconsider_pot=false` when `P` was added to UH.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense? Or maybe my `assert` isn't the right interpretation of this? I don't think this changes what `FindCandidateSet` outputs, but it means I still don't quite understand the \"avoid jump ahead in unmodified pot sets\" commit :(\r\n\r\n(fwiw the fuzz I crashed on is `echo \"AQBJCAgAIysjIyMiIyMjIyMjIyMjIyM6IyMIACMrIyMjIiMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjCBlE+xEvRG9v\r\nAggAbwAR\" | base 64 -d`)\r\n\r\nEDIT: ah sorry, I just reread this part\r\n\r\n> it may be that what was in UH before becomes eligible to move as well, but doing so does not seem to affect the performance or number of iterations the algorithm needs.\r\n\r\nso I see that this is expected. Perhaps including this in the commit message would help, as I was confused by \"In exclusion branches (where inc does not change, and transactions are only removed from und), the jump ahead optimization cannot find anything to add to inc that wasn't possible already.\"",

These adhoc initialization costs do not interact with the $\\sqrt{2^k}+1$ rule, because that rule is at the per-candidate-set level, while the adhoc costs are applied at the linearization level. It does in theory interact with the derived $\\sqrt{12 * 2^n}+n$ rule, but for $n \\leq 3$ the linearization code is optimal without any search, and for $n \\geq 4$, the formula is sufficiently overshooting to accomodate the ad-hoc costs. Still, I've changed the test to use precomputed limits instead.",
