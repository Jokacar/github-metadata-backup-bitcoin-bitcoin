    "title": "Document tx relay policy?",
    "body": "Since there are other projects relying on transaction relay policy, it was suggested to document the policy. However, this comes with questions and obstacles. For example, documentation might misrepresent what is done in the code, due to:\r\n  * misunderstanding of the author\r\n  * it becoming stale/outdated\r\n  * it being incomplete\r\n\r\nMy recommendation for users is to test all of their use cases on each upgrade of Bitcoin Core, including all edge cases they rely on, ideally with an automated test suite to minimize their repeated work. Thus they should already be aware of the policy rules they rely on, and also be notified of changes by their test suite.\r\n\r\nIf there are plans to nonetheless document the relay policy, it raises questions what to include in what form and how to keep it up-to-date/consistent.",

I also think having a markdown doc would be appropriate for guiding the process, as code comments might not be clear/communicative enough to people not familiar with the code, and BIPs are too static. I would frame it as \"don't just broadcast any transaction and expect it to propagate, here are some restrictions enforced by Bitcoin Core policy (not necessarily exhaustive)\"\r\n\r\nwrt maintainability, not to discount the burden of maintaining docs, but policy doesn't really change that much... maybe we can give it a shot? :)",

Though we have 50y of history proving that's a not so bad engineering practice in the area of computer networking :)\r\n\r\nDocumentation is a formidable tool to formalize thinking and actually interrogate the well-foundedness and correctness of any code. It would also ease the understanding of new contributors and help them to review muzzy part of the codebase like the mempool. \r\n\r\n> My recommendation for users is to test all of their use cases on each upgrade of Bitcoin Core, including all edge cases they rely on, ideally with an automated test suite to minimize their repeated work. Thus they should already be aware of the policy rules they rely on, and also be notified of changes by their test suite.\r\n\r\nI agree with this.\r\n\r\nIt's unrealistic to expect Core developers to track and understand any new use case. Ultimately it's the responsibility of the application developers to think about the assumptions they're doing on Core policy and be fully-aware it might to change to their _detriment_. \r\n\r\nThat said, I think it would help application quality audit if policy changes happen in the beginning or mid release schedule. Further it's really _hard_ to ensure your test suite is reflecting Core behavior, straightforward toolchain might not exist yet (see https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoinconsensus/pull/15).\r\n\r\n> If there are plans to nonetheless document the relay policy, it raises questions what to include in what form and how to keep it up-to-date/consistent.\r\n\r\nYes let's avoid the BIP process it's too much static, maybe we can try a`doc/policy/*.md` ?\r\n\r\nHappy to try the experiment with my full-rbf proposal for 0.24 and write an updated documentation of our replacement logic. Then documenting  `PreChecks`'s list of checks could be following steps if we think it's good practice.\r\n\r\n(Maybe the new package acceptance checks could be documented there too?)\r\n\r\nLastly, yes it's a maintenance burden though if we don't I think we'll let proliferate more safety risks for our downstream users and find us in thorny situations where we have to arbitrarily favor use-case A over use-case B. E.g \"zero-conf transactions\" vs \"dual-funded channels\" with the deprecation of opt-in : https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-June/019074.html",

      "body": "I agree with most of the above (definitely worth documenting Core transaction relay policy given how Layer 2 depends on it and documentation should provide clarity and perhaps even stumble on more things we didn't realize).\r\n\r\n> Yes let's avoid the BIP process it's too much static, maybe we can try a doc/policy/*.md ?\r\n\r\nBut I think avoiding the BIP process entirely on this is suboptimal. Firstly, we have to consider alternative implementations to Core e.g. @pinheadmz was the [first](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/88813/is-inherited-replace-by-fee-signaling-implemented-as-described-in-bip125) to discover the BIP 125 issue while reimplementing it for Bcoin. Reimplementing from scratch a spec/standard seems superior to just copying the code in Core.\r\n\r\nI think the better approach would be to document this in the Core repo under the expectation that significant step changes to tx relay policy should be BIPed. The Core docs can be a moving target while changes that deserve more scrutiny should be BIPed. I really don't like this attitude that because Core's consensus code is the ultimate authority on consensus that Core's policy code should also be the ultimate authority on policy. The former can't be avoided, the latter can be.\r\n\r\nedit: My understanding is that Layer 2 wants transaction relay policy to be as static as possible (or at least when changes are made they are well communicated in advance to Layer 2). To this end the extra scrutiny of a BIP for a significant change should be beneficial.",

Now hoping it would attract more eyes because it's BIPed... maybe it gives a chance to third-party developers to object in case of annoying/harmful changes for them but I'm the opinion it would be better for the Core project to be more proactive on its policy changes, like \"best practice\" ML announcement for tightening with an open consultation period or flag day activation.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, not systematically proposing Core's policy in the BIP repo make it less authoritative IMO. Other full-node implementations or Bitcoin software should feel free to document their own policies as examples, and in fact that's an area where they could easily do far better than Core. Less legacy codes and they can experiment faster because they have less risks to break application software (though on the long term, I hope we'll be able to deploy policies in a more sandboxed approach, once the work on multiprocess/interfaces is more mature)",

          "body": "When RBF was originally implemented in #6871, the mempool did not keep track of ancestor scores yet. It was pointed out that ancestor scores would be the most accurate metric, and [suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6871#discussion_r43031583) to temporarily \"Require that any new inputs that show up in the replacing transaction be already confirmed. In the future, if we do merge something like ancestor package tracking and better mining code, we could update this...\"\r\n\r\n#7594 added ancestor tracking to the mempool. It enables mempool validation and mining code to directly access a mempool entry's ancestor score (total modified fees divided by total vsize for the transaction and all of its mempool ancestors). As such, we now have the ability to do what was desired originally.\r\n\r\nThis PR does 2 things:\r\n\r\n(1) When evaluating a transaction for RBF, requires the replacement transaction to have a higher ancestor score than that of each original transaction. This boils down to \"the replacement transaction is a better candidate for mining (by feerate) than all of the transactions it would replace.\"\r\n\r\n(2) Removes enforcement of BIP125 Rule #2, allowing replacement transactions to spend unconfirmed inputs not spent by the original transactions.",
