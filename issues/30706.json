I am aware backtrace only contains ??? instead of anything useful, that's probably because I don't have debugging symbols for bitcoind, or maybe I would need to have it compiled locally with special flags and so on. This is not the case, so I only have what I shared.\r\nLogs contains nothing else worth mentioning, machine continues to run as intended. Bitcoind is in automatic restart loop, I've implemented this years ago when I was having problems with it. Not any more, this rare crash is first time I've seen in years.\r\nIf you have any suggestions how to enable more debugging in bitcoind, so that any future backtrace can be more useful, please let me know.",

I am not a build system expert, so I am not sure where the problem lies.\r\n\r\nMy knowledge goes only as far as adding `deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-debug/ bookworm-debug main` to the sources.list and then installing *-dbgsym packages. But that will not include bitcoind, because that's an external executable I downloaded.
