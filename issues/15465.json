    "body": "We've adopted a bunch of [code style guidelines](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#coding-style-c) over the last couple of years.\r\n\r\nAccording to sipa's [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14635#issuecomment-435225900):\r\n\r\n> In my view, writing a particular guideline in the document implies that we're as a project committing to (eventually) adopting it. Choosing a guideline that mismatches the existing code is giving ourself extra work in fixing it (and while that is ongoing, live with the inconsistencies in the codebase).\r\n> \r\n> The question is whether the suggested style is enough of an improvement over the existing guidelines that it warrants all that work.\r\n\r\nWe'd eventually like to converge on the new style, but since our developer guidelines state \"Do not submit patches solely to modify the style of existing code.\", it'll be a very long time (or more likely, never) until all code is migrated to the new style.\r\n\r\nI'd like to suggest that we take a more proactive approach to change (parts of) the codebase to the new style. This is beneficial because those parts of the codebase can act as models for new contributors, and we could perhaps enable linters on them to enforce style and avoid regressing. We could start with one or two files or modules to migrate.\r\n\r\nThe obvious time to do this is immediately after a major release: the focus running up to a release branch is on reviewing, so the PR queue is drained, and many of the PRs that are still open will already require rebase. For example, if we decide to do this for the wallet after the 0.18 branch split, there are currently only 18 PRs open that are tagged \"Wallet\", not tagged \"Needs rebase\" and succeeding checks.\r\n\r\nPut another way: every line that needs to be changed to converge will be changed eventually, causing rebases for other PRs. Concentrating those changes to times when there are fewest PRs open minimized total rebase pain (although increases it in the short run). There are also economies of scale to just doing a single style rebase over trickling out the changes so there are many small style rebases.\r\n\r\nI can see arguments both ways, and would be interested in hearing others' thoughts.",

Though, when it comes to net_processing, validation or consensus code, I'd rather not touch it at all, since style fixes could change behaviour (even if done through a formatter that is supposed to only change whitespace). Reviewing such a patch to make sure it doesn't change the logic might not be worth the effort.\r\n\r\nAbout adding a linter: Different versions of formatters generally produce differently formatted output, so I am not sure if we can force every developer to install the same tool in the same version.",

This will take a little effort because some macros insert line numbers, and these will need to be bypassed.\r\n\r\n> To use clang format normativeily we must end up specifying a particular version that all contributors must use, as clang format changes its behavior. This is irritating, and disruptive to contributing. It could be made much better with good automation like cfield's depbuilder work, to help people get a particular version of clang-format; though due to the flowing API breakage in C++ code, I don't know how long an older version will be maintainable.\r\n\r\n> Another concern is which style to specify. The most common behavior in Bitcoin Core today has stylistic elements which have been objectively shown to increase software defect rate and confuse review-- e.g. unbraced multi-line IFs. We should not make any disruptive reformating changes unless we are quite confident that the style is what we want to live with.\r\n\r\n> We could avoid disrupting the workflow of existing patches by only reformatting (and then requiring it) on new files and substantial rewrites. I think that would be a better path.\r\n\r\n> To the extent that there is hope to address bikeshedding via this, I beg anyone thinking that to give up that thought. Bikeshedding is not a result of any particular coding style or consistency, bikeshedding arises from a lack of perspective which can only be addressed by experience, community norms, and having more important things to worry about.\r\n\r\n> Stylistic consistency has actual benefits; it aids newcomers in their contributions because it is easier for them to make sure their work is okay on styleistic grounds; though this may be offset by having to install some particular version of clang-format before they can get started. It eases review because the uniformity creates better expectations; but reformating makes looking at the history harder, which harms review. Good style choices (as opposed to merely consistent) have, at times, been shown to lower defect rates in software-- but there is not a universal opinion on what choices are good. So there are benefits to be had, but they must be carefully managed with other risks and costs. And the magnitude of the potential benefits, I think, are enough to say that this subject should have a very low priority in general.",

The point is that status quo means that we'll keep wasting that time. On the other hand, by doing the suggested one-time change using `black` and `clang-format` and enforcing it mechanically via a Travis check (+ corresponding pre-commit hook locally) we'll never have to think about this ever again. We will have literally no back-and-forths over style and thus no time will be wasted in the future, no?",

      "body": "I feel like we have already unintentionally swung fairly far towards a trade-off that optimizes for various more aesthetically oriented ideas of 'good code' over more prosaic definitions of software quality like stability, innovation, or general functionality...\r\n\r\n[I say aesthetically intentionally: very little coding-standard advice has ever been experimentally verified to reduce the defect rate of software or improve development speed.  I support our coding standards and also support the spread of their application, but we should not deceive ourselves into thinking that we know they provide a substantial level of benefit beyond aesthetically.]\r\n\r\nThere is already a large number of changes going on already that disrupt longer living PRs that are improving the software in ways that are unambiguously visible to users, to the point where multiple (previously) high volume contributors have cited it as a reason for decreasing their involvement in the project.\r\n\r\nMy own view is that this pattern is exacerbated by the fact that changes that are intended to have no effect feel a lot safer, so they are more attractive to make (more stuff done), easier to convince people to merge and as a result end up in a fast-lane compared to substantive changes that carry some known risk, require more specialized review, have review delayed due to changeset instability due to style nits, and are harder to mechanically rebase.\r\n\r\nBecause the most dangerous change is an unsafe change falsely believed to be intrinsically safe many refactors even carry a \"coerced review\" cost-- where it looks sure to get merged quickly but where someone feel forced to review because it might not actually be as safe as people think. I've reviewed more than a few changes that I thought were entirely pointless, due to this. Doing a little bit of work you don't care about is a cost of collaboration, but we need to manage that cost.  Coding style changes are probably among the most extreme in terms of the small amount of benefit they provide users vs the amount of collateral damage they do to other development.\r\n\r\nThere is another option to wasting time going back and forth over style:  We could simply stop cutting ourselves, by being more relaxed about it. -- exactly as Luke-jr says. Ignore the smallest of nits, make style advice in a purely advisory way (as in, feel free to adjust if you happen to rebase, otherwise don't bother), move style adjustments-- if any-- until right before merging and not as soon as a PR opens.  We've operated in that fashion before and I think the project accomplished a lot more at that time and was more enjoyable. (Likely not all due to coding style nits, but I would be surprised if it wasn't a factor.)\r\n\r\nIf I thought we were currently hitting a good stride, I wouldn't have any particular qualm with hitting parts of the system with formatting cleanups especially if an effort was made to specifically avoid disrupting other work. In a really healthy state we would have have a resource surplus to absorb some of the disruption that sort of work would create but I don't feel we do now. At this time I don't even think it is worth considering.\r\n\r\n(I also wouldn't apply the above reasoning to a specific narrow changes with a clear and strong benefit profile. If someone were to a case could be made for going and-- say-- adding missing bracing, based on concrete information in research and past experience in our own codebase about defects being hidden by missing braces I would think it was worth considering. ... But not \"everything in the style guide because its in the style guide\")\r\n",

      "body": "Thanks everyone for the thoughtful input. Needless to say, I don't think this is a burning priority, but I do think that we could reduce overall disruption and improve the developer experience by being more strategic in how we tackle code style. A few comments:\r\n\r\n- a couple of comments above mention appropriateness for _this project_. I don't think considering _this project_ as a uniform whole is a useful model. The project is made up of many different parts, each with their own properties, which should be considered separately. For example, changing code style in the rpc code is a vastly different trade-off from touching net_processing.cpp, validation.cpp or `EvalScript()`. That's why I suggested attempting this for a small number of files or self-contained module.\r\n- All the comments above have been from long-time contributors. You all have the great advantage of knowing the history of the codebase and having context on why a coin in the collection of coins is called a `CCoinsCacheEntry`, but a single coin is a `Coin` (why not `CCoin`?), or why wallets contain `nWalletVersion`, `TxSpends` and `m_location`, or 100 other quirks of the code. You have the disadvantage that it's difficult for you to see the codebase with the eyes of a new contributor, where the lack of consistency is quite confusing. I found naming in the bitcoin core codebase very confusing when I started looking at the code 2 years ago. Arguably it's now even worse because we've partially adopted a new style and so there's even more inconsistency.\r\n- I maintain that given that we do have code style guidelines, doing a one-time fixup reduces the overall workload and improves contributor experience and the quality of review. For example, if I touch a single line `if` block in my PR, am I obligated to add braces? Either way, I'm likely to get review comments saying \"add braces\" or \"don't change unrelated code style\". Starting from a point where the code matches the style guide would avoid these wasted review cycles.\r\n- Finally, I've received out-of-band feedback from two separate contributors who say that they want to comment on this issue but feel like the debate has been shut down and they wouldn't be listened to. That in itself is troubling.",

      "body": "> I found naming in the bitcoin core codebase very confusing when I started looking at the code 2 years ago. \r\n\r\nFor what it's worth I agree that the code base is intimidating to newcomers. I think this is mostly due to lack of documentation of the architecture, and lack of clear interfaces (though this is improving, for sure!) between components. I don't think surface-level aesthetics is very important here. Whether a variable is called `nFee` or `n_fee` or braces wrap around is not going to affect understanding as much as whether, say, the function it is in has a good description and Doxygen documentation for all arguments. And high-level documentation of how things work and interact, would be even nicer.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of frustrates me, personally, is that we didn't manage to clearly separate out the consensus parts. Not to a library (which would be useful for `rust-bitcoin` et al), but also not even to a separate directory. I was a bit shocked by #15618 which snuck in a (luckily harmless) change into `validation.cpp` in a completely unrelated PR.\r\n\r\nIf we need any more linters it should be to check for unexpected changes to consensus code, for example! **This** is dangerous territory.\r\n\r\nIMO, the goal of this project is to maintain the correct consensus on the bitcoin network. All else is secondary. Again, I feel that the focus of some people on surface-level code style issues is mistaken. \r\n\r\n> doing a one-time fixup reduces the overall workload and improves contributor experience and the quality of review\r\n\r\nIf it would really be that, it would be great. However I don't believe this would actually be a one-time change. I'm afraid it will just encourage people to be even more nitpicky, both in filing \"fixup\" PRs and commenting in PRs about code style issues.\r\n\r\n> Assume you want to do something to `./src/wallet/` and get approval from a bunch of recent wallet-reviewers\r\n\r\nYep. Ideally we would automate this through `CODEOWNERS` (https://github.blog/2017-07-06-introducing-code-owners/).\r\n",

      "body": "My view hasn't changed.\r\n\r\nI'm dubious of the claim that adherence to code style is a material impediment to many new contributors, and to the extent that it is the fact that PRs get style nitpicked all to heck is probably a greater deterrent than consistency.\r\n\r\n> For example, if I touch a single line if block in my PR, am I obligated to add braces? Either way, I'm likely to get review comments saying \"add braces\" or \"don't change unrelated code style\".\r\n\r\nI think this is more of a symptom of the current review process that a massive style change would not resolve-- yes, the instances of questions of if you're responsible to make a style update to a piece of code may be reduced somewhat but I think the complaint is just a symptom that the review is inconsistent and focused on minutia (and focused on minutia in a way that feels oppressive rather than enabling).   That underling issue wouldn't be resolved by the refactor, but just be moved to any of the hundreds of other bits of minutia review that go on (like &/* hugging types or names or whatever). \r\n\r\nFor all these things-- \"CCoinsCacheEntry, but a single coin is a Coin (why not CCoin?), or why wallets contain nWalletVersion, TxSpends and m_location\"-- I don't know and I have to look them up each time. But that will be true regardless of what they're named. Anyone just guessing a variable from the name alone would always be taking a significant risk.  I'm doubtful of any contributor's (even experienced ones) ability to craft code in a way which will be automatically by its structure/style apparent to anyone else (even their future selves)-- better documentation helps, cleaner interfaces help. Variable naming? once you are past the point of actively misleading names (or meaningless single characters) there are pretty diminishing returns.  We specify a style so that you can just fall back on it without having to think and result in something that isn't too bad.  The style is a thinking aid and a time saver but not itself a independent measure of quality.\r\n\r\nI'm not completely unreceptive to the view that there are different approaches and these factors are more important to some people than others... and I do appreciate the efforts to improve the software in ways that are themselves not very meaningful to me.  But again I reiterate: the background level of refactors, style changes, cleanups, and other related activity  is actively repelling multiple long term contributors, myself included.  I beg: give it a bit of a rest, we have so many other things that are crying for our attention and our resolve.   We should try to find some initiatives that we all feel more exited about, success with them would make it easier to work on other things... but right now a big style change is just not a unifying effort.\r\n\r\n",

It's perfectly fine to say that you don't want to do something in a PR if you feel it is outside the scope of the change, including/especially if it seems extremely nitpicky.

On the other side, we have confused contributors and, maybe, we have less contribution, because of style doubts.\r\n\r\nI think this can be solved with policies that have a long grace period (say five years). In order not to waste any time on style, the policies can be written on a wiki, like the release notes, or on a different project, not with our code, so that the editing of the style guidelines is not a PR itself. This way, every time we have some comment on style, we can link the wiki and spend less time on this kind of comments.

During the grace period, contributors are requested (but not forced) to write new code compliant with the rules. At the end of the grace period of each rule, we will decide if migrating existing code or not (something like #15612 and #15638).\r\n\r\nExample of rules can be (I'm not advocating these rules; they are only examples, taken from Google C++ style guide):\r\n- \"Objects with static storage duration are forbidden, unless they are trivially destructible.\"\r\n- \"We do not use exceptions.\"\r\n- \"Each line of text in your code should be at most 80 characters long.\"\r\n\r\nThis approach (rule -> long grace period -> enforcement decided (or not) at the end of the long period) will freed a lot of time wasted on this type of recurring discussions.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents.",

Because of this, some of gmaxwell's and laanwj's arguments to me sound something like, \"I don't want to go to the doctor today because I'm feeling sick.\"\r\n\r\nThat said, I think whether or not this proposal is a good idea depends on the details of the proposal. I strongly agree with Greg's \"if we were to do this, we'd do it in a limited window and strongly discourage any refactors outside of that window,\" and he's right that merging style PRs immediately after branching would make backporting unnecessarily difficult. I also like Marco's and Wladimir's ideas about treating validation code differently.\r\n\r\nTo me an good proposal look something like:\r\n\r\n- There will be a 2 week window a few weeks after each release (roughly every 6 months) where we consider merging style and refactoring-only PRs.\r\n- Developers will be free to submit, review, and ACK style PRs outside the window, but the PRs will only be considered for merging outside the window if they help implement a user-visible feature or make a measurable performance improvement.\r\n- PRs should avoid changing validation and non-validation code at the same time, and there will be a much higher bar for accepting style changes to validation code.",

In particular, having multiple styles within a single function/class seems like it makes things harder, rather than easier. On the other hand, spending lots of cycles changing the code to match the guidelines seems high risk  and low reward.\r\n\r\nSo, personally, I'd rather revisit #10461 and add something like \"hungarian-style with camel case is fine for local variables, public/protected class members and function parameters if it matches nearby/related code; prefixes are \"n\" for number, \"p[class]\" for pointers, [...].\"\r\n\r\nOtherwise, how about changing all (non-const, non-static) globals to actually have the `g_` prefix? I could see that potentially being a refactor to make things more consistent that actually has a worthwhile risk/reward payoff (since it's then easier to find globals, and harder to accidently shadow/alias them via locals or class members)?",

          "body": "UpdateTransactionsFromBlock is called during a re-org. When a re-org occurs, all of the transactions in the mempool may be descendants from a transaction which is in the pre-reorg block. This can cause us to propagate updates, worst case, to every transaction in the mempool.\r\n\r\nBecause we construct a `setEntries setChildren`, which is backed by a `std::set`, it is possible that this algorithm is `O(N log N)`.\r\n\r\nBy using an Epoch visitor pattern, we can limit this to `O(N)` worst case behavior.\r\n\r\nEpochs are also less resource intensive than almost any set option (e.g., hash set) because they are allocation free.\r\n\r\nThis PR is related to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17268, it is a small subset of the changes which have been refactored slightly to ease review. If this PR gets review & merge, I will follow up with more PRs (similar to #17268) to improve the mempool ",

This PR serves to bring the file\r\ninto uniform compliance with the standing guidelines, which\r\nshould prevent/ease further confusion.\r\n\r\nThis is a whitespace-only PR, as can be verified by enabling\r\nthe \"Hide whitespace changes\" option in GitHub's WebUI;\r\nnet 0/0 additions/deletions.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI know blanket refactors such as this are generally\r\ndiscouraged, but seeing as there is little current activity with\r\nthis file at the moment, and that it is bringing it into styling\r\ncompliance, I feel it is appropriate/justified if for nothing else\r\nthan squashing a discrepancy in the existing code styling\r\nthat is in direct contradiction to the stated guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: I have specifically ignored the pointer/reference side portion\r\nof clang-format here specifically to make this a whitespace-only\r\nchange-set. As such, anyone running the `clang-format-diff.py`\r\nscript manually against this commit will see further changes that\r\nare intentionally omitted here, but could be added if deemed\r\nappropriate.\r\n",

It should cost less than 10 seconds to solve them by hand. With the right tool, even less than 10 milliseconds, as explained in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22954#issuecomment-992194995 .\r\n\r\n> overall i still think we'd be best to rip the band-aid and just clang-format the whole damn thing.\r\n\r\nI tend to disagree. clang-format on a large scale will need to be reviewed very carefully. It is rare, but does happen that clang-format produces code that is almost impossible to read after a reformat.\r\n\r\n> write a tool that can compare deterministic build binaries before/after clang format (can we make that deterministic)?\r\n\r\nI've seen binaries change with just a single empty line added or removed in a header file. https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools#build-for-compare might be a good start, but I think developing a tool that is actually good at this will be tricky.\r\n\r\nAlso, 23546 was a clang-tidy change, not clang-format ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
