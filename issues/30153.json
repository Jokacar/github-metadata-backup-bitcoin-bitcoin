    "title": "Improve the bitcoin.conf instructions in init.md doc",
    "body": "Update the `init.md` instructions about  generating an example `bitcoin.conf` file.\r\n\r\n~~Additionally, the `share/examples/bitcoin.conf` placeholder file says to follow the instructions in `contrib/devtools/README.md`, which was confusing to me since that README talks about many scripts. It would be helpful to point out to the user which section to refer to.~~ (EDIT: removed this change from the PR.)\r\n\r\nThis issue includes an accompanying PR #30154.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n- Two years ago, `share/examples/bitcoin.conf` was replaced with [a placeholder file](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/b483084d866c16d97a34251ae652bac94f85f61d). To see an example `bitcoin.conf`, the user now runs the `contrib/devtools/gen-bitcoin-conf.sh` script, which replaces the placeholder file with the parsed contents of `bitcoind --help`.\r\n\r\n- The instructions in `init.md` about an example `bitcoin.conf` haven't changed significantly since they were [added almost 10 years ago](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blame/234bfbf6a5fcba37e510e9cb6c1f2a629cd0290e/doc/init.md#L39).\r\n",
