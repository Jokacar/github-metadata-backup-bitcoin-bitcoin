    "body": "All the values selected by the transaction issuers are implemented to respect current hard policy limits as of 27.0\r\nBitcoin Core version (e.g `MAX_PACKAGE_COUNT` or `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT`). As such introducing a new distinction in the Bitcoin ecosystem among tx-relay policy checks enforced by full-nodes hosts of a said full-node implementation/version and the the policy-check opt-ed by any transaction or second-layers use-cases. That way any significant on-chain economic  traffic can be still processed by low-performance full-nodes hosts, without altering the DoS profile risks.\r\n\r\nE.g in the context of the Lightning Network, lightning nodes can adjust their pinning risk exposures affecting their channel funds safety differently in function of each lightning topological peers (- assuming the BOLT protocol upgrades its negotiation flow `open_channel` / `accept_channel`). As such lightning peers can enforce a trade-off between their off chain HTLC throughputs and their tx-relay jamming exposure (e.g pinning or RC attacks).\r\n\r\nE.g in the context of collaborative custody management, distrusted stakeholders owning a set of pre-signed set of transactions can all commits to the same set of max tx size / max package limits, as such introducing more reliability on the worst amount of fee-bumping reserves that should be provisioned instead of hard limits like the current approach with v3.\r\n\r\n_Wait ! I’m lost reading this OP ?! Already  too much information, what should I do ? Go to read Bitcoin Optech 10 articles series’s [“Waiting for confirmation: a series about mempool and relay policy”](https://bitcoinops.org/en/blog/waiting-for-confirmation/) as a starter and then come back to read or comment._\r\n\r\nThe opt-in mechanism uses a one bit flag in the nSequence field which is already a standard and consenus Bitcoin transaction field since the genesis block. The mechansim (`ParsePackageTopologicalLimits()`) check that bip68 is disabled to avoid conflicts of semantics, as the remaining nSequence field bits are interpreted as dynamic issuers-selected policy checks (currently implemented ancestor / descendant / max package limits size). The intrusive aspect of the mechanism is minimal and the interpreted field could be uplifted in other parts of standard transaction fields while conserving the same policy check enforcement semantics.\r\n\r\nHere the code excerpt that deserves a `doc/policy/` , a BIP or a banana.\r\n```\r\n (sequence_field & SEQUENCE_ISSUER_SELECTED_LIMITS_DISABLE_FLAG) {\r\n        return std::nullopt;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const uint32_t ancestor_limit = sequence_field & SEQUENCE_ISSUER_SELECTED_ANCESTOR_MASK;\r\n    const uint32_t descendant_limit = sequence_field & SEQUENCE_ISSUER_SELECTED_DESCENDANT_MASK;\r\n    const uint32_t weight_limit = (uint32_t)(sequence_field & SEQUENCE_ISSUER_SELECTED_WEIGHT_MASK)\r\n     << SEQUENCE_ISSUER_SELECTED_WEIGHT_GRANULARITY;\r\n\r\n    // This parsing logic can be adapted for forward-compatibility in matters of issuer-selected\r\n    // policy limits:\r\n    //      - encodes accumulated package SigOpCost\r\n    //      - commit to package-level dynamic DUST_RELAY_TX_FEE or DEFAULT_INCREMENTAL_RELAY_FEE\r\n    //      - opt-in if limits are strict (at the pckg-level) or composable (at the tx-level)\r\n    //        to allow non-interactive composability among N chain of transaction issuers.\r\n\r\n    IssuerSelectedLimits tx_issuer_selected_limits(ancestor_limit, descendant_limit, weight_limit);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIssuer-selected fields getting economic popularity and not jeopardizing bitcoin security model and long-term decentralization equlibrium of the ecosystem of peer-to-peer full-nodes and solo mining operations could get a consensus enforcement, going through the traditional consensus design & development process (narrator note: no ones really knows or is sure there is  something as traditional consensus development process...). The nSequence consensus field due to its 32 bits limitation is space limited, even if a lot can be achieved with bit-wise operations.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical philosophy perspective, I think this introduction of issuer-selected transaction / package policy limits checks should should reduce the amount of \"bargaing-on-policy\" we have seen recently with `mempoolfullrbf` (LN-vs-zero-conf-acceptance business) or do-digital-art-on-chain-and-the-posterity-will-say-if-it-is-bansky-or-crap-waste colored coins and tokens experimentations.\r\n\r\nThis patchset built on the v3 patchset and its followups (commit `37fdf5a4`), is already integrated in the package mempool\r\nacceptance code flow. There is 1 logical conflict for now as the 1000 vbytes limit is enforced by default for v3 (which still\r\nexposes a lot of loss of funds risk exposure for some time-sensitive flows like lightning considering \"loophole\" and NTA pinning scenario  - see #28948). In the future, this limit can just become a \"tx issuer-selected policy check\" limit.\r\n\r\nIn the future, such transaction / package “issuer-selected” can be used as a signaling mechanism, e.g for [replace-by-feerate](https://petertodd.org/2024/one-shot-replace-by-fee-rate) dynamic window enforced at the mempool-level, for the use-cases who wishing to ensure their chain of transactions are minimal by not using CPFP.\r\n\r\nFor more discussions on mempool policy technical philosophy design and trade-offs on downstream use-cases, see the old email  thread [\"On mempool consistency\"](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021116.html).\r\n\r\nThis patchset can be applied on top of any fork of bitcoin core 27.0 with the minimal of engineering effort by anyone wishing\r\nto experiment with mempool policy for its use-case (I'll see if I have time to carry this patchset forward as I'm officially in\r\nsabbatical from bitcoin core development taking the sun on the beach just yelling at them when the stuff is broken, we’re all btc investors).",

          "body": "See #27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nDelving Bitcoin discussion thread: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/v3-transaction-policy-for-anti-pinning/340\r\nDelving Bitcoin discussion for LN usage: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/lightning-transactions-with-v3-and-ephemeral-anchors/418\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n- There are various pinning problems with RBF and our general ancestor/descendant limits. These policies help mitigate many pinning attacks and make package RBF feasible (see #28984 which implements package RBF on top of this). I would focus the most here on Rule 3 pinning. [1][2]\r\n- Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see #27677 and #28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n\r\nV3 policy is for \"Priority Transactions.\" [3][4] It allows users to opt in to more restrictive topological limits for shared transactions, in exchange for the more robust fee-bumping abilities that offers. Even though we don't have cluster limits, we are able to treat these transactions as having as having a maximum cluster size of 2.\r\n\r\nImmediate benefits:\r\n\r\n- You can presign a transaction with 0 fees (not just 1sat/vB!) and add a fee-bump later.\r\n- Rule 3 pinning is reduced by a significant amount, since the attacker can only attach a maximum of 1000vB to your shared transaction.\r\n \r\nThis also enables some other cool things (again see #27463 for overall roadmap):\r\n- Ephemeral Anchors\r\n- Package RBF for these 1-parent-1-child packages. That means e.g. a commitment tx + child can replace another commitment tx using the child's fees.\r\n- We can transition to a \"single anchor\" universe without worrying about package limit pinning. So current users of CPFP carve out would have something else to use.\r\n- We can switch to a cluster-based mempool [5] (#27677 #28676), which removes CPFP carve out [6].\r\n\r\n[1]: Original mailing list post and discussion about RBF pinning problems https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff, https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html\r\n[2]: A FAQ is \"we need this for cluster mempool, but is this still necessary afterwards?\" There are some pinning issues that are fixed here and not fully fixed in cluster mempool, so we will still want this or something similar afterward.\r\n[3]: Mailing list post for v3 https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html\r\n[4]: Original PR #25038 also contains a lot of the discussion\r\n[5]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393/7\r\n[6]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393#the-cpfp-carveout-rule-can-no-longer-be-supported-12",

Relaying 1-parent-1-child CPFP when mempool min feerate is high would be a subset of the use cases, but a pretty significant improvement over what we have today.\r\n- Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27677 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n- The majority of this code is useful for building e.g. #27742.\r\n\r\nThis means 1p1c packages propagate in the \"happy case\" where nobody is deliberately withholding packages.\r\n\r\nTo make this more robust, we need receiver-side logic to retry orphan resolution with multiple peers. Also, since we rely on the orphanage to remember the child while waiting for the parent, peers may cause us to drop packages by sending lots of orphans. To make this robust, we need to make efforts to protect some amount of orphans from eviction.\r\n\r\n[1]: see this writeup and its links https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/02ec218c7857ef60914e9a3d383b68caf987f70b/bip-0331.mediawiki#propagate-high-feerate-transactions",

I strongly suggest that reviewers look at that PR first to decide if they are comfortable with the overall approach.\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly refactors, with a few behavior changes and improvements:\r\n- Introduces `TxDownloadManager`, which handles all transaction downloading. It contains the `TxRequestTracker`, `TxOrphanage`, and filters for `AlreadyHaveTx`.\r\n- Updates logs for tx {validation, relay, orphans} to include both txid and wtxid when possible.\r\n- Adds a new log category, `TXPACKAGES`. Logging in the orphanage is changed from `MEMPOOL` to `TXPACKAGES`.\r\n- Adds support for tracking when multiple peers provided the same tx in the orphanage.\r\n- Makes `TxDownloadManager` responsible for tracking the orphans we need to resolve and deciding how/when to resolve them.\r\n- Adds all announcers of an orphan as potential resolution candidates. This tracker is a `TxDownloadManager` which helps us schedule requests.\r\n   - In this PR, \"orphan resolution\" means requesting missing parents by `getdata(MSG_TX | MSG_WITNESS_FLAG, missing_txid)`.\r\n    - In a future PR, we'll add another resolution method, requesting ancestor wtxids using `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO, orphan_wtxid)`.",

There are no tests, the CI is failing, and a lot of the code comments are incorrect/irrelevant to the adjacent lines.\r\n\r\nI also don't really understand the motivation from the PR description. There seems to be a large number of goals and issues that aren't clearly defined. Would you mind writing something a bit clearer and more concise?",
