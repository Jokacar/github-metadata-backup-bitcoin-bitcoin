    "title": "Prioritize processing of peers based on their CPU usage",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we process messages to/from all peers in a loop where every peer is processed once (has the same weight). The list of peers is shuffled before every loop.\r\n\r\nConsidering a scenario where we spend considerably more CPU time for some peers compared to others, does it make sense to de-prioritize CPU-hungry peers? This might be happening deliberately (a CPU DoS attack) or not.\r\n\r\nFor example: if we spent 5 CPU seconds to process each one of the peers `Bad` and `Demanding` and 1 CPU second to process peers `Normal` and `Light`. Then on the next loop, we can process just `Normal` and `Light` so they now account to 2 CPU seconds each and skip `Bad` and `Demanding`. Do a few loops like this until everybody is around 5 CPU seconds and then process all of them again.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how much sense this makes, but at least it seems worthy of brainstorming.\r\n\r\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30572 aims to address a problem of peers sending a lot of costly-to-validate-but-invalid transactions in an attempt to CPU DoS a node. To me it seems that whether those transactions are requested by the victim or are sent unsolicited is secondary. More importantly, willingly or not, some peers are eating the CPU and some not, so this is a broader issue.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAim to spend approximately the same amount of CPU time for every peer. Or, within some reasonable margin, e.g. if the difference between the lightest and the heaviest peer is more than 10x, then trigger some protective mechanism.\r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nDrop unsolicited transactions. IMO that would not really resolve the DoS.\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\nI got this idea while reading https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/cpu-usage-of-peers/196/2",
