    "body": "Remove `fees.h`, `errors.h`, and `spanparsing.h` from the util library. Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Move `Split` functions from `util/spanparsing.h` to `util/string.h`, using `util` namespace for clarity.\r\n- Move remaining spanparsing functions to `script/parsing.h` since they are used for descriptor and miniscript parsing.\r\n- Combine `util/fees.h` and `util/errors.h` into `common/messages.h` so there is a place for simple functions that generate user messages to live, and these functions are not part of the util library.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this change is that the util library is a dependency of the kernel, and we should remove functionality from util that shouldn't be called by kernel code or kernel applications. These changes should also improve code organization and make functions easier to discover. Some of these same moves are (or were) part of #28690, but did not help with code organization, or made it worse, so it is better to move them and clean them up in the same PR so code only has to change one time.\r\n",

          "body": "By defining a virtual interface class for the scheduler client, users of the kernel can now define their own event consuming infrastructure, without having to spawn threads or rely on the scheduler design.\r\n\r\nRemoving `CScheduler` also allows removing the thread and exception modules from the kernel library. \r\n\r\nTo make the `CMainSignals` class easier to use from a kernel library perspective, remove its global instantiation and adopt RAII practices.\r\n\r\nRenames `CMainSignals` to `ValidationSignals`, which more accurately describes its purpose and scope.\r\n\r\nAlso make the `ValidationSignals` in the `ChainstateManager` and CTxMemPool` optional. This could be useful in the future for using or testing these classes without having to instantiate any form of signal handling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587). It improves the kernel API and removes two modules from the kernel library.",

This removes `BCLog::Level::None` entirely -- for `LogFlags::NONE` just use `Level::Info`, for any actual category, use `Level::Debug`.\r\n\r\nAdds docs to developer-notes about when to use which level.\r\n\r\nAdds `-loglevelalways=1` option so that you get `[net:debug]`, `[all:info]`, `[all:warning]` etc, which might be helpful for automated parsing, or just if you like everything to be consistent. Defaults to off to reduce noise in the default config, and to avoid unnecessary changes on upgrades.\r\n\r\nChanges the behaviour of `LogPrintLevel(CATEGORY, BCLog::Level::Info, ...)` to be logged unconditionally, rather than only being an additional optional logging level in addition to trace and debug. Does not change the behaviour of `LogPrintLevel(NONE, Debug, ...)` and `LogPrintLevel(NONE, Trace, ...)` being no-ops.",

This PR makes it possible to access these parameters directly by name. This is achieved by holding the parameters in a separate `JSONRPCParameters` class which contains mappings from both name to value, and position to value. Two `operator[]` methods are implemented which can accept both strings and ints. This allows for backwards compatibility, while also allowing for future implementation to access the parameters by name.\r\n\r\nThe processing of named arguments ends up being entirely overhauled in order to be able to store the mappings to the parameters.\r\n\r\nBased on #26485 to avoid conflicting with it.",

With this patch built locally you can test with your own filesystem path (example):\r\n\r\n`tor --SocksPort unix:/Users/matthewzipkin/torsocket/x`\r\n\r\n`bitcoind -proxy=unix:/Users/matthewzipkin/torsocket/x`\r\n\r\nPrep work for this feature includes:\r\n- Moving where and how we create `sockaddr` and `Sock` to accommodate `AF_UNIX` without disturbing `CService`\r\n- Expanding `Proxy` class to represent either a `CService` or a UNIX socket (by its file path)\r\n\r\nFuture work:\r\n- Enable UNIX sockets for ZMQ (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27679)\r\n- Enable UNIX sockets for I2P SAM proxy (some code is included in this PR but not tested or exposed to user options yet)\r\n- Enable UNIX sockets on windows where supported\r\n- Update Network Proxies dialog in GUI to support UNIX sockets\r\n",

          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [x] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick). [DONE, see [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/research-into-the-effects-of-a-cluster-size-limited-mempool-in-2023/794/1)]\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add duplicate transactions to the mempool (#29990).\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts.

That would presumably mean util/bitdeque.h and util/sock.cpp should also eventually go elsewhere, for example? That seems like a bad approach to me (in that it means code has to move into and out of util based on whether it's relevant to the kernel, rather than due to any changes to the code itself, and users then potentially have to deal with it moving into/outof the util:: namespace).",

As for now, it reads:\r\n\r\nThis seems like the right place to talk about the relationship between the util and kernel library. My work on the kernel library has been focusing on reducing its essence to validation code, pruning external dependencies, and stripping out as much system related functionality as possible. I think if the goal is to have the kernel be capable of running on as many platforms as possible, potentially beyond the number of platforms that Bitcoin Core is capable of today and extending into embedded environments, this last point becomes crucial.\r\n\r\nLooking at the content of `util` it provides roughly two types of functionality: Utilities for basic data structures and their serialization, and cross-platform system related utilities, like file handling, threading, process handling, etc. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, making the `util` library a proper dependency of the kernel should not introduce new cross-platform system-related content into the kernel library. Besides potentially limiting use cases of the kernel, providing cross-platform utilities beyond what the kernel strictly requires seems like a potentially unreasonable future maintenance burden. This would be contrary to our incremental process of creating a minimal kernel library.\r\n\r\nThe asterisk here is that some of the utilities that are not currently used by the kernel do not introduce new dependencies, since they entirely rely on code that is already used by the kernel. I also generally think that some utilities could remain in the util library even though they are not currently used by validation code. The criteria I propose for evaluating if modules should remain in util after this PR are:\r\n\r\n1. The module is directly used by kernel code.\r\n2. The module contains basic data structure utilities for interacting with kernel code.\r\n3. The module does not contain system-related utilities that are not directly used by the kernel.\r\n4. The module does not contain project-specific code that is not relevant to the kernel.\r\n5. The module does not introduce new dependencies beyond the current dependencies of the kernel.\r\n\r\nLooking at @hebasto's comment [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28690#pullrequestreview-1774033780), `threadinterrupt.cpp` and `readwritefile.cpp` would violate the 3rd criteria in my eyes, while the `spanparsing` and `bytevectorhash` modules could potentially remain in `util`.\r\n\r\nBetween this PR and #28690 I think it would be nice if common criteria for `util` would be defined and documented. All this said, I think it would be acceptable too if things were kept purposefully vague as they are now until the need for more concrete structures arises.",

I could see this being useful in the future if util library started growing a lot and accumulating more features of over time.\r\n\r\nBut for now, IMO, just sticking with the current util/common separation and using the cleanup in this PR would organize things better and be less confusing than having two util versions, and it would require moving fewer things. Even though the libraries.md document is currently ambiguous, I think it should be pretty easy to remove the ambiguity here.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29015#issuecomment-1849026409\r\n\r\n> The criteria I propose for evaluating if modules should remain in util after this PR are:\r\n\r\nI think these are good rules if you replace \"basic data structure utilities\" with \"basic utilities that to do not require outside dependencies\", and also drop the 3rd rule. It seems like with the 3rd rule you are trying to make a distinction between \"data structure utilities\" and \"system-related utilities\", and I don't think it helps to draw a dividing line there.\r\n",

I just don't you need to `rm src/util/sock.cpp` to achieve these goals. As long as the util library is distributed as a static library, or built as a static library and linked into a dynamic library, the socket functions will not be part of resulting executables if they are not called. And if the kernel is being built for a platform which doesn't support sockets at all, `src/util/sock.cpp` can just be stubbed or not compiled at all and there should be no problem for portability either. I do think it's good to keep the util library small and lightweight and remove things which don't fit there. But I don't think it needs to be stripped down in a more extreme way.",

Then again, if `sock.cpp` uses common modules, why is it in `util` in the first place?

(followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Noise\r\n\r\n- [ ] use EllSwift https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66, implemented in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/28\r\n- [ ] certificate signing issue: https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/717, fix in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/29\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [x] persist static key (needs #29229)\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [x] create `Sv2Transport` subclass similar to `V2Transport`: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/27\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n- [ ] adjust base58 encoding of authority public key https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/721\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [x] hold on to templates a bit after a block is found https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/709 (in case of race to prevent downstream crashes, though we still wouldn't relay it without additional changes)\r\n- [ ] hold on to template transactions even if the mempool drops them (for some time)\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

The `--descriptors` and `--legacy-wallet` options are removed from the functional tests.\r\n\r\nBDB has been removed as a dependency and documentation have been updated to reflect that.\r\n\r\nDepends on #26596",

If larger, fail.\r\n3) The package rbf may not evict more than 100 transactions from the mempool(bip125 rule 5)\r\n4) The package is a single chunk\r\n5) Every directly conflicted mempool transaction is connected to at most 1 other in-mempool transaction (ie the cluster size of the conflict is at most 2).\r\n6) Diagram check: We ensure that the replacement is strictly superior, improving the mempool\r\n7) The total fee of the package, minus the total fee of what is being evicted, is at least the minrelayfee * size of the package (equivalent to bip125 rule 3 and 4)\r\n\r\nPost-cluster mempool this will likely be expanded to general package rbf, but this is what we can safely support today.\r\n",

However it made no sense to me to store a `CKey` as plain text. See commit \"Persist static key for Template Provider\" for how it's used.\r\n\r\nIt uses a template and leverages the fact that both `std::string` and `std::vector<unsigned char>>` have an `insert()` method that can take a char array.\r\n\r\nThe `unsigned char` support is not used in this PR, but tests do cover it.",

This narrowly scoped functionality allows use with v3-like topologies, and will be expanded at some point post-cluster mempool when diagram checks can be done efficiently against bounded cluster sizes.\r\n2) Replacement for single tx RBF(in a cluster size of up to two) against conflicts of up to cluster size two. `ImprovesFeerateDiagram` interface will have to change for this use-case, which is a future direction to solve certain pins and improve mempool incentive compatibility: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/ephemeral-anchors-and-mev/383#diagram-checks-fix-this-3\r\n\r\nAnd longer-term, this would be the proposed way we would compute incentive compatibility for all conflicts, post-cluster mempool.\r\n\r\n",

The main differences are explained here, including why Stratum v2 can't use BIP234 (yet): https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/stratum-v2-noise-protocol-bip324-nuggets/413\r\n\r\nThe implementation is based on revision 38, 2018-07-11 (most recent at the time of writing).\r\n\r\nThe Stratum v2 spec defines the specific choice of ciphers: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/04-Protocol-Security.md\r\n\r\nThis protocol has been implemented in the Stratum Reference Implementation (SRI, using [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin)). https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum\r\n\r\nIt has also been (independently) implemented in BraiinsOS. This part is currently not open source, and it's behind on some recent changes.\r\n\r\nThe classes in `sv2_noise.h` attempt to stay close to the paper, whereas the test and fuzzer code borrow heavily from BIP324.\r\n\r\nIt's ready for review, but not for merge:\r\n\r\n1. The parent PR may need more conceptual review (and perhaps the entire spec, but that would really slow things down)\r\n2. We could decide to not support Noise encryption at all and require users to install separate software for that. Code review of this PR could help inform that decision.\r\n\r\nYou can see this code in action in the parent PR #29432.\r\n\r\nInitial seed corpus: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/169\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe following spec change is already implemented in this PR and in SRI:\r\n\r\n* The spec is being modified to use EllSwift (instead of regular x-only) for the encoding of public keys and ECDH: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66",

          "title": "Extend signetchallenge to set target block spacing",
          "body": "Inspired by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27446, this PR implements the proposal detailed in the comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27446#issuecomment-1516600820.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nIntroduce the ability to configure a custom target time between blocks in a custom Bitcoin signet network. This enhancement enables users to create a signet that is more conducive to testing. The change enhances the flexibility of signet, rendering it more versatile for various testing scenarios. For instance, I am currently working on setting up a signet with a 30-second block time. However, this caused numerous difficulty adjustments, resulting in an inconsistent network state. Regtest isn't a viable alternative for me in this context since we prefer defaults to utilize our custom signet when configured, without impeding local regtest development.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nIf the challenge format is `OP_RETURN PUSHDATA<params> PUSHDATA<actual challenge>`, the actual challenge from the second data push is used as the signet challenge, and the parameters from the first push are used to configure the network. Otherwise the challenge is used as is.\r\n\r\nThis change is backward-compatible, as per the old rules, such a signet challenge would always evaluate to false, rendering it unused.\r\n\r\nThe only parameter currently available is \"target_spacing\" (default 600 seconds). To set it, place `0x01<target_spacing as uint64_t, little endian>` in the params. Empty params are also valid. If other network parameters are added in the future, they should use `0x02<option 2 value>`, `0x03<option 3 value>`, etc., following the protobuf style.\r\n\r\nTwo public functions were added to `chainparams.h`:\r\n  - `ParseWrappedSignetChallenge`: Extracts signet params and signet challenge from a wrapped signet challenge.\r\n  - `ParseSignetParams`: Parses `<params>` bytes of the first data push.\r\n\r\nFunction `ReadSigNetArgs` calls `ParseWrappedSignetChallenge` and `ParseSignetParams` to implement the new meaning of signetchallenge.\r\n\r\nThe description of the flag `-signetchallenge` was updated to reflect the changes.\r\n\r\nA new unit tests file, `chainparams_tests.cpp`, was added, containing tests for `ParseWrappedSignetChallenge` and `ParseSignetParams`.\r\n\r\nThe test `signet_parse_tests` from the file `validation_tests.cpp` was modified to ensure proper understanding of the new logic.\r\n\r\nIn the functional test `feature_signet.py`, the value of `-signetchallenge` was changed from `OP_TRUE` to the wrapped challenge, setting spacing to 30 seconds and having the same actual challenge `OP_TRUE`.\r\n\r\nThe Signet miner was updated, introducing a new option `--target-spacing` with a default of 600 seconds. It must be set to the value used by the network.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nI tested this PR against [Mutinynet](https://blog.mutinywallet.com/mutinynet/), a signet running on a custom fork of Bitcoin Core, implementing 30s target spacing. I successfully synchronized the blockchain using the following config:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsignet=1\r\n[signet]\r\nsignetchallenge=6a4c09011e000000000000004c25512102f7561d208dd9ae99bf497273e16f389bdbd6c4742ddb8e6b216e64fa2928ad8f51ae\r\naddnode=45.79.52.207:38333\r\ndnsseed=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe content of this wrapped challenge:\r\n\r\n```\r\n6a OP_RETURN\r\n4c OP_PUSHDATA1\r\n09 (length of signet params = 9)\r\n011e00000000000000 (signet params: 0x01, pow_target_spacing=30)\r\n4c OP_PUSHDATA1\r\n25 (length of challenge = 37)\r\n512102f7561d208dd9ae99bf497273e16f389bdbd6c4742ddb8e6b216e64fa2928ad8f51ae\r\n(original Mutinynet challenge)\r\n```",

There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #26812\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

          "title": "wallet: Target a pre-defined utxo set composition by adjusting change outputs",
          "body": "This PR is designed for the use case of a Lightning node that provides liquidity of predefined amounts via [liquidity ads](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/878).\r\n\r\nCoin selection is currently optimized to reduce the size of the utxo set and create change optimized for privacy. A liquidity provider instead needs to service multiple liquidity requests by spending confirmed utxos of known sizes.\r\n\r\nIdeally most liquidity transactions would be funded by a single input or a small set of inputs optimized to reduce fees. To minimize the number of unconfirmed transactions, inputs should also be sized in a range where most transactions do not produce change. When change is created, it should be divided into outputs of the sizes needed so that the wallet's utxo set converges towards an ideal utxo set specified by the user.\r\n\r\nI am opening this PR as a draft to get feedback and suggestions on the concept and my implementation to address this use case.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm described below can be implemented externally via RPC calls or directly in the wallet. \r\n\r\n1. Externally: use a new option to set the change target used for coin selection. \r\n2. Wallet (opportunistic): a new configuration file defines the desired utxo set which the wallet uses to compute the change target used for coin selection and to split change outputs (if any). \r\n4. Wallet (reactive/proactive):  pre-select a large input to force coin selection to produce change when fees are below some specified threshold or the desired set of utxos falls below some threshold. \r\n\r\n## utxo targets file example:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"buckets\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"start_satoshis\": 10000,\r\n            \"end_satoshis\": 25000,\r\n            \"target_utxo_count\": 150\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"start_satoshis\": 50000,\r\n            \"end_satoshis\": 75000,\r\n            \"target_utxo_count\": 50\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"start_satoshis\": 200000,\r\n            \"end_satoshis\": 250000,\r\n            \"target_utxo_count\": 20\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"start_satoshis\": 1000000,\r\n            \"end_satoshis\": 1400000,\r\n            \"target_utxo_count\": 5\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"bucket_refill_feerate\": 30000\r\n}\r\n```\r\n - The `target_utxo_count` for a bucket should be larger than the anticipated number of liquidity requests of `bucket_start_satoshis` within the expected confirmation time of a liquidity transaction.\r\n - The range from `bucket_start_satoshis` to `bucket_end_satoshis` should encompass expected fee variance.\r\n - The `bucket_refill_feerate` should be set to the expected median fee rate (?).\r\n - This file will be reloaded for every spend request to allow for on-the-fly updates\r\n\r\n## Algorithm steps\r\n\r\nFor each payment do the following:\r\n\r\n1) Calculate the current capacity of each target bucket from the wallet's utxo set.\r\n    - Include outputs from both confirmed and unconfirmed transactions in the wallet to calculate capacity.\r\n2) Add our largest confirmed utxo as an input IF the capacity of the least full target bucket is below some threshold (eg. < 30% full) or less than some higher threshold (eg. < 70%) and fee rates are below the `bucket_refill_feerate`.\r\n    - When the largest confirmed utxo is from one of our target buckets, then we should refill our wallet with a utxo from cold storage.\r\n3) Set the minimum change target [`m_min_change_target`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3054416f62644120a4a6bc76e927054c7fbbd487/src/wallet/coinselection.h#L147) to a value from the target bucket with the lowest current capacity.\r\n    - Generate a random change target of the amount: current `change_fee` (the fee for creating an output) + a random value in the range: `bucket_start_satoshis` to `bucket_end_satoshi` - `change_fee`.\r\n    - Currently the change target is set by [`GenerateChangeTarget()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6ff0aa089c01ff3e610ecb47814ed739d685a14c/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L824) in a hard coded range.\r\n    - This parameter is only used by the 'knapsack' and 'coingrinder' algorithms.\r\n4) Call ['SelectCoins()'](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3054416f62644120a4a6bc76e927054c7fbbd487/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L1132) with the input from step 2 (if any) added to the `preset_inputs` parameter and with the minimum change target from step 3.\r\n    - The `consolidatefeerate=0` configuration option should always be set so that utxos are not preemptively cosolidated. Coin selection sets the parameter [`m_long_term_feerate`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/37fdf5a492786c1772b5b40773a1031237447070/src/wallet/coinselection.h#L160) to the wallets `consolidatefeerate`.\r\n    - Ideally, only the 'bnb' and 'cg' coin selection algorithms should be used and the others disabled to optimize for low fees.\r\n5) If the coin selection result includes a change output, then split the single change output amount into multiple outputs.\r\n    - Add the mimimum change target as an output first.\r\n    - If there is remaining value after paying the fee for a new output, then add a target from the next most empty target bucket.\r\n    - If there is not enough value to add a new output and fees, add remaining value to the last output added instead.\r\n\r\n",

We currently [warn against shadowing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#shadowing) in the docs but do not detect it, so instead rely on review to identify these issues.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n* This was [previously enabled in 2016 ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8794) and [reverted six months later](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10136).\r\n* [I proposed a version in 2019](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15377) using a different approach in a different context.\r\n\r\nThe question is: have the circumstances changed in the past 9 years? Is a partial fix beneficial?\r\n\r\nOne option would be to merge the low-risk changes, re.  tests, etc. and exclude\r\nsensitive files from this warning to get it applied to regular builds.\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27087\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

          "body": "[An earlier approach](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/1d226ae1f984c5c808f5c24c431b959cdefa692e/) in #28956 involved simplifying and refactoring the network-adjusted time calculation logic, but this was eventually [left out](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28956#issuecomment-1904214370) of the PR to make it easier for reviewers to focus on consensus logic changes.\r\n\r\nSince network-adjusted time is now only used for warning/informational purposes, cleaning up the logic (building on @dergoegge's approach in #28956) should be quite straightforward and uncontroversial. The main changes are:\r\n\r\n- Previously, we would only calculate the time offset from the first 199 outbound peers that we connected to. This limitation is now removed, and we have a proper rolling calculation. I've reduced the set to 50 outbound peers, which seems plenty.\r\n- Previously, we would automatically use the network-adjusted time if the difference was < 70 mins, and warn the user if the difference was larger than that. Since there is no longer any automated time adjustment, I've changed the warning threshold to ~~20~~ 10 minutes (which is an arbitrary number).\r\n- Previously, a warning would only be raised once, and then never again until node restart. This behaviour is now updated to  1) warn to log for every new outbound peer for as long as we appear out of sync, 2) have the RPC warning toggled on/off whenever we go in/out of sync, and 3) have the GUI warn whenever we are out of sync (again), but limited to 1 messagebox per 60 minutes\r\n- no more globals\r\n- remove the `-maxtimeadjustment` startup arg\r\n\r\nCloses #4521",

          "title": "kernel: Handle fatal errors through return values",
          "body": "Based on #25665.\r\n\r\nCurrently functions issuing fatal errors call the `fatalError` notification method to issue a shutdown procedure. This makes it hard for higher level functions to figure out if an error deeper in the call stack occurred. For users of the kernel it might also be difficult to assert which function call issued a fatal error if they are being run concurrently. If the kernel would eventually be used by external users, getting fatal error information through a callback instead of function return values would also be cumbersome and limiting. Unit, bench, and fuzz tests currently don't have a way to effectively test against fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThis patch set is an attempt to make fatal error handling in the kernel code more transparent. Fatal errors are now passed up the call stack through `util::Result<T, FatalError>` failure values. A previous attempt at this by theuni always immediately returned failure values if a function call returned a failure. However, this is not always desirable (see discussion [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27866#discussion_r1256378064)). Sometimes, further operations can still be completed even if a fatal error was issued. The solution to this is that these \"ignored\" errors are still moved through `util::Result`'s error string values with its `.MoveMessages` method, even while a failure value in the result is not present.\r\n\r\nNext to some smaller behavior changes, the most significant change is that the issuing of a shutdown procedure is delayed until a potential fatal error is handled as opposed to immediately when it is first encountered. Another effect is that potential fatal errors are now asserted in the bench, fuzz and unit tests. Some of the currently not immediately returned fatal errors need some further scrutiny. These are marked with a `TODO (fatal error)` comment and could be tackled in a later PR.\r\n\r\nTo validate this approach a new clang-tidy check is introduced. It implements the following checks:\r\n\r\n1. If a function calls another function with a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` return type, its return type has to be `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` too, or it has to handle the value returned by the function with one of `CheckFatal`, `HandleFatalError`,\r\n`UnwrapFatalError`, or `CheckFatalFailure`.\r\n2. In functions returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` a call to a function returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` needs to propagate the value by either:\r\n   - Returning it immediately\r\n   - Assigning it immediately to an existing result with `.MoveMessages()` or `.Set()`\r\n   - Eventually passing it as an argument to a `.MoveMessages()`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587) and is a step towards stage 2, creating a more refined kernel API.",

          "body": "This PR lets indexing code mostly run outside of the node process. It also improves indexing sync logic, which is moved out of indexing code to a new [`node::SyncChain()`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/8d8cdcb37005030f646ba3c45f7f54f556efb8bf/src/node/chain.h#L24-L39) function.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the commits in this PR are small refactoring changes that move code from `src/index/` to `src/node/`, or replace references to node types like `CBlockIndex`, `CChain`, `CChainState` in index code. There are only two commits affecting indexing sync logic which make complicated or substantive changes:\r\n\r\n- [`8746b35301c5` indexes: Rewrite chain sync logic, remove racy init](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24230/commits/8746b35301c5f65ff3200555fb2b82417fd2c758)\r\n- [`ad88f50ddd12` indexes: Initialize indexes without holding cs_main](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24230/commits/ad88f50ddd129dddd974bbf9fd7d86ec86b65508)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commit messages have more details about these and other changes. Followups to this PR will reuse indexing sync code for wallets (#15719, #11756) and let indexes run in separate processes (#10102)",

          "body": "This PR implements the [proposed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1540) MuSig2 descriptors, derivation, and PSBT fields so that the wallet can receive and spend from taproot addresses that have keys involving a MuSig2 aggregate key.\r\n\r\nThis pulls in (an older version of) the musig module in libsecp (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1479) in order to do all of the necessary MuSig2 computation.\r\n\r\nAn open question is whether the approach for handling the secnonces is ideal and safe. Since nonces must not be reused, this PR holds them exclusively in memory, so a restart of the software will require a restart of the MuSig2 signing process. Additionally, the current MuSig API in libsecp basically involves us holding onto and passing around an opaque libsecp object. There may be some additional work there to make the code more ergonomic.",

          "title": "Broadcast own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections",
          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNext step after this PR is done will be to have the wallet do the private broadcast as well, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11887 would have to be resolved.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

The `libbitcoin_util` still depends on `libbitcoin_crypto`, `libbitcoin_consensus` and `libbitcoin_common` libraries.\r\n\r\nIf such an outcome is expected, maybe update the `doc/design/libraries.md` accordingly?",

      "body": "re: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29015#issuecomment-2083201174\r\n\r\n> The `libbitcoin_util` still depends on `libbitcoin_crypto`, `libbitcoin_consensus` and `libbitcoin_common` libraries.\r\n\r\nThanks for checking this. Letting the util library depend on the crypto library seems like the easiest path to take because random.cpp, randomenv.cpp, hasher.cpp, and bytevectorhash.cpp are using the crypto hash functions. But I added new commits to the PR to remove the util dependency on crypt, and remove consensus and common dependencies on util. I also added a [script](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/rmutil/test/util/check-deps.sh) which turned up a few other other unexpected dependencies (not related to util), which could be addressed separately. I think the script should be able to run in CI, too, but I did not set that up.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRebased 5eeafeb302dcf56dd5c16c1e4785a41a132344c7 -> 6ea5ee5a268cfbb9cd234e0f1381c8a4785ff04c ([`pr/rmutil.13`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/rmutil.13) -> [`pr/rmutil.14`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/rmutil.14), [compare](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/pr/rmutil.13-rebase..pr/rmutil.14)) adding dependency checking script and removing unexpected dependencies related to util",

The only issue is I never figured out a good way to run the IWYU tool that didn't seem to add lot of unrelated changes to PRs, given that existing includes are so messy, and there are so many that could be cleaned up. If you have any advice on how to run IWYU with this PR, I'd be happy to follow. Or you already have a clear idea of how to clean up includes and just want implement changes on a branch, I'd be happy to use that.",

The main place where `TransactionError` codes are actually used, and the place where the type was introduced in #14978 was in `node/transaction.h` and `node/transaction.cpp` for the `BroadcastTransaction` function. But disappointingly I think, the same type was also reused in other places like wallet code and psbt code, with extra enum values added to support these. I think it would be better if the enum were split up so it would be clearer which functions returned which values, so for example, you would not be goaded by compiler into writing error handling code for enum values that could never be returned. \r\n\r\nWith this background, I thought for this PR putting `TransactionError` in `node` instead of `common` would be better so it would be more likely to be appropriately used for functions like `node::BroadcastTransaction` and `interfaces::Node::broadTransaction`, and less likely to be misused for non-node functions. I could understand the opposite argument, though, that if even if it belongs in `node` when used ideally, it makes more sense for it to be in `common` based on the way it is used now.\r\n\r\nMore generally, I do think it's good for public node types to be defined in the node library, even if they may be also used by outside code (such as as GUI code or code in src/interfaces/ or src/common/). It makes the outside code clearer and more self documenting if you can see which libraries types are coming from. CNodeStats, CNodeStateStats, and SynchronizationState are examples of other node types which are used by the GUI outside  the node library. AddressPurpose, isminetype, CRecipient, and CCoinControl are examples of wallet types used by the GUI outside the wallet library, and I think in both cases it is helpful for these types to have node:: and wallet:: prefixes when used by outside code.\r\n\r\nBut this is just to explain my reasoning. I wouldn't oppose moving the type to common if you think that is better. I will also look into splitting up the TransactionError type to see if there's an easy way to clean this up completely.",

I wasn't expecting paragraphs of response :)\r\n\r\nYeah sorry thanks for pinning down the actual concern. Before you just said it \"seems odd\" so I felt like I needed to justify my entire thought process.\r\n\r\nIn any case, both the node and wallet libraries expose public types which I listed above (CNodeStats, CNodeStateStats, and SynchronizationState, AddressPurpose, isminetype, CRecipient, and CCoinControl) which can be considered part of the interfaces to these libraries, but are not part of the libraries themselves. For example, the GUI code is not allowed to call node or wallet functions, but it uses all of these public types, and this is fine. Other code, including code in common, can also use these types and there is no problem with this.\r\n\r\nWe do have a choice where about where to put public types which are not really part of any library. We can put them in the interfaces directory, or in common, or in the node and wallet directories. Personally, I think it makes sense to put them in the wallet directory when they are related to wallet functionality and used by wallet code, put them in the node directory when they are related to node functionality and used by node code, put them in the common directory when they are related to common functionality (like PSBT) and used by common code. The comments at the top of {node,wallet,common}/types.h files are meant to explain the idea that these are public types.\r\n\r\n> Doesn't really seem worth worrying about the fact that some of the errors only make sense in a node context; aren't these all just \"something went wrong, deal with it, dear user\"?\r\n\r\nYes if errors are just being propagated to the user level, you don't care about this at all, and it's probably a mistake to use an enum to begin with because the error messages won't be able to contain useful context. In this case, though, the errors are being translated to RPC codes, and RPC callers may actually want to implement different forms of error handling, so it would be good to be clear about what errors are possible, plus it's easy to do, so I did add a new commit splitting PSBTError from TransactionError.\r\n\r\n> BTW, I think `TransactionError::P2P_DISABLED` can be dropped entirely? (I think the last/only use was removed in #15713)\r\n\r\nThanks, the new commit drops this code too.",
