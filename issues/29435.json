If the child contains an input from our wallet, that input cannot be reused until the child is abandoned.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/pull/2818\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nWe should try to detect if a such a child transaction becomes conflicted due to a parent becoming conflicted and mark it as such.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nA (failing) test for this behavior can be found at https://github.com/achow101/bitcoin/commit/213fa91d5c289204e3f1e01194b1fccd08a69c6c\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nmaster@128b4a80387d322a7810d8716eccdac95ff9b8cd\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nArch\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",

          "body": "When a transaction is directly double-spent, bitcoind is able to automatically detect it and free up wallet inputs that are used in double-spent transactions. However, when a transaction becomes invalid because one of its ancestors is double-spent, bitcoind is not able to detect it and will keep wallet inputs locked forever.\r\n\r\nThe only cases where this can happen are:\r\n\r\n- splice transactions when a commitment transaction that is not based on the latest splice is confirmed\r\n- anchor transactions in the above case, or when a different version of the commitment confirms (e.g. remote commit while we're trying to CPFP ou local commit)\r\n\r\nWhen we detect that this happened, we abandon the corresponding transactions, which ensures that we don't end up with unusable liquidity in our wallet.\r\n\r\nWe also remove cases where we eagerly abandoned transactions, which could lead us to double-spend ourselves inadvertently because the abandoned transaction could still confirm while we reused its inputs in another transaction (which is a real issue when using 0-conf).",
