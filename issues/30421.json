    "title": "utils: add support for `bitcoin-wallet` tool configuration file",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nI would like to propose the addition of support for a configuration file specifically for the `bitcoin-wallet` tool. This feature would allow users to specify command-line options in a configuration file (e.g., `wallet.conf`), similar to how `bitcoin.conf` works for `bitcoind`. The configuration file should be automatically loaded by `bitcoin-wallet` if present in the default data directory or specified via a command-line option.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nYes, this feature is related to the problem of having to repeatedly specify command-line options every time the `bitcoin-wallet` tool is used. For users who frequently interact with the `bitcoin-wallet` tool, it can be cumbersome and error-prone to enter the same options repeatedly, such as `-datadir`, `-wallet`, and debugging options.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n- **Configuration File Support**: Implement support for a `wallet.conf` file that can contain the various options and arguments currently passed via the command line.\r\n- **Automatic Loading**: If a `wallet.conf` file is found in the default data directory, it should be automatically loaded by the bitcoin-wallet tool.\r\n- **Command-line Override**: Allow users to specify an alternative configuration file location using a `-conf=<file>` command-line option.\r\n- **Option Precedence**: Command-line options should take precedence over those specified in the configuration file, allowing for flexible and dynamic usage.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
