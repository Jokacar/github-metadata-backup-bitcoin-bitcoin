          "body": "Add additional Clang thread safety analysis annotations as discussed with @sipa (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10866#issuecomment-316238630) and others.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to #10866 ~~which this PR is rebased upon (awaiting merge of #10866). The first three commits (8a1dc09, e022990 and cbae151) can be reviewed in #10866.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR contains three types of changes:\r\n1. Add missing locks (based on the `GUARDED_BY(...)` analysis below). Please review thoroughly.\r\n2. Add `GUARDED_BY(...)` annotations to allow for Clang's thread safety analysis at compile-time. Does not change run-time behaviour.\r\n3. Add `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(...)` annotations to allow for Clang's thread safety analysis at compile-time. Does not change run-time behaviour.\r\n\r\nBackground reading: The [\"C/C++ Thread Safety Analysis\"](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/42958.pdf) paper (Hutchins, Ballman & Sutherland, 2014) paper describing Clang thread safety analysis and how it is used for the Google C++ codebase:\r\n\r\n> They essentially provide a static type system for threads, and can detect potential race conditions and deadlocks. This paper describes Clang Thread Safety Analysis, a tool which uses annotations to declare and enforce thread safety policies in C and C++ programs.\r\n> […]\r\n> It has been deployed on a large scale at Google; all C++ code at Google is now compiled with thread safety analysis enabled by default.\r\n> […]\r\n> The `GUARDED_BY` attribute declares that a thread must lock `mu` before it can read or write to `balance`, thus ensuring that the increment and decrement operations are atomic. Similarly, `REQUIRES` declares that the calling thread must lock mu before calling `withdrawImpl`. Because the caller is assumed to have locked `mu,` it is safe to modify `balance` within the body of the method.",

The concerns raised in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10386#issuecomment-302361381 are also addressed due to #12257.\r\n\r\n~~Note: this builds on top of #15780.~~ (merged)",

          "body": "When creating signatures for transactions, always make one which has a 32 byte or smaller R and 32 byte or smaller S value. This results in signatures that are always less than 71 bytes (32 byte R + 32 byte S + 6 bytes DER + 1 byte sighash) with low R values. In most cases, the signature will be 71 bytes.\r\n\r\nBecause R is not mutable in the same way that S is, a low R value can only be found by trying different nonces. RFC 6979 for deterministic nonce generation has the option to specify additional entropy, so we simply use that and add a uin32_t counter which we increment in order to try different nonces. Nonces are sill deterministically generated as the nonce used will the be the first one where the counter results in a nonce that results in a low R value. Because different nonces need to be tried, time to produce a signature does increase. On average, it takes twice as long to make a signature as two signatures need to be created, on average, to find one with a low R.\r\n\r\nHaving a fixed size signature makes size calculations easier and also saves half a byte of transaction size, on average.\r\n\r\nDUMMY_SIGNATURE_CREATOR has been modified to produce 71 byte dummy signatures instead of 72 byte signatures.",

Additionally, because SRD uses effective values, the previous fee increasing loop thing is now removed and effective value is used everywhere.\r\n\r\nSome tests may fail spuriously because they may rely on semi-deterministic behavior from the original coin selection algorithm. I have been able to fix the ones that fail the most, but others may still have issues. Please let me know if you see any tests fail for coin selection reasons (e.g. insufficient funds, missing inputs, etc.) and I will try to fix them.\r\n\r\nI will be working on doing simulations this week and will post the data once I finish them.",

          "body": "This PR is the last in a chain of PRs (#14437, #14711, and #15288) that make the wallet code access node state through an abstract [`Chain`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/wipc-sep/src/interfaces/chain.h) class in [`src/interfaces/`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/wipc-sep/src/interfaces) instead of using global variables like `cs_main`, `chainActive`, and `g_connman`. After this PR, wallet code no longer accesses global variables declared outside the wallet directory, and no longer calls functions accessing those globals (as verified by the `hide-globals` script in #10244).\r\n\r\nThis PR and the previous PRs have been refactoring changes that do not affect behavior. Previous PRs have consisted of lots of mechanical changes like:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    wtx.nTimeReceived = GetAdjustedTime();\r\n+    wtx.nTimeReceived = m_chain->getAdjustedTime();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is smaller, but less mechanical. It replaces last few bits of wallet code that access node state directly (through `CValidationInterface`, `CRPCTable`, and `CCoinsViewMemPool` interfaces) with code that uses the `Chain` interface.\r\n\r\nThese changes allow followup PR #10102 (multiprocess gui & wallet PR) to work without any significant updates to wallet code. Additionally they:\r\n\r\n* Provide a single place to describe the interface between wallet and node code.\r\n* Can make better wallet testing possible, because the `Chain` object consists of virtual methods that can be overloaded for mocking. (This could be used to test edge cases in the rescan code, for example).",

After this refactoring, the bumpfee PR could call AddToWallet safely instead of implementing a duplicate AddToWallet function.\r\n\r\nThis also allows getting rid of the CWalletTx copy constructor to prevent unintentional copying.",

          "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an `--enable-multiprocess` configure option which builds new `bitcoin-node`, `bitcoin-wallet`, and `bitcoin-gui` executables with relevant functionality isolated into different processes. See [doc/design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/design/multiprocess.md) for usage details and future plans.\r\n\r\nThe change is implemented by adding a new [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that spawns new wallet and node subprocesses that can be controlled over a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) by calling [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/node.h), [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/wallet.h), and [`ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/chain.h) methods. When running with split processes, you can see the IPC messages going back and forth in `-debug=1` output. Followup PR's #19460 and #19461 add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\r\n\r\nThe IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/ipc/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSlides from a presentation describing this change are available on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).\r\n",
