Also this code could probably be improved by updating unit tests to set nChainTx correctly, so the two special case conditions in the assert allowing `pindex->nChainTx == 0` could be dropped.",

If we don't have it, `ReceivedBlockTransactions`  hasn't been called, and both `nTx` and `nChainTx` are 0.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the check `assert((pindex->nChainTx == pindex->nTx + prev_chain_tx)`  cannot be applied to headers for which we never processed the block data, and this has nothing to do with AssumeUtxo or Testing.\r\n\r\nI'll open a PR with a fix tomorrow unless someone disagrees.",

      "body": "> * The final pindex->IsAssumedValid() check added in [#28791](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28791) seems a little overbroad. I think the condition `(pindex->nChainTx == pindex->nTx + prev_chain_tx)` should actually be true for all assumed-valid blocks except the first one and the last one, so that check could be tightened up\r\n\r\nAfter trying this out, I think that this is not the case. The `BLOCK_ASSUMED_VALID` status is only removed when the block is connected to the chain and raised to `BLOCK_VALID_SCRIPTS`. However, `nTx` and `nChainTx` are updated from their fake to their actual values in `AcceptBlock` / `ReceivedBlockTransactions`, which happens before that. So during the period where we receive blocks for the background chain in some, possibly random, order, there will be a mix of blocks with updated `nTx` and fake `nTx` ones, so that the condition could fail everywhere in the range of assumed-valid blocks.\r\n\r\n> * It might possible to add a test covering the assert failure that pindex->IsAssumedValid() from [#28791](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28791) fixes, since [#28791](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28791) didn't seem to include a test\r\n\r\nFor that, we'd need a chain where some blocks (at least the snapshot block, possibly also others) have additional transactions.\r\nIt seems not very clean to update the regtest chainparams everytime we want to test a snapshot with a slightly different chain.\r\nNot sure if this has been discussed before, but maybe it could make sense to add a RPC that allows us to register an entry to `m_assumeutxo_data` dynamically (just for regtest of course).\r\n\r\n",
