          "body": "Replace `LogPrint*` functions with severity based logging functions:\r\n\r\n * `LogInfo(...)`, `LogWarning(...)`, `LogError(...)` for unconditional (uncategorised) logging (replaces `LogPrintf`)\r\n * `LogDebug(CATEGORY, ...)` and `LogTrace(CATEGORY, ...)` for conditional logging (replaces `LogPrint`)\r\n * `LogPrintLevel(CATEGORY, LEVEL, ...)` for when the level isn't known in advance, or a category needs to be added for an info/warning/error log message (mostly unchanged, but rarely needed)\r\n\r\nLogs look roughly as they do now with `LogInfo` not having an `[info]` prefix, and `LogDebug` having a `[cat]` prefix, rather than a `[cat:debug]` prefix. This removes `BCLog::Level::None` entirely -- for `LogFlags::NONE` just use `Level::Info`, for any actual category, use `Level::Debug`.\r\n\r\nAdds docs to developer-notes about when to use which level.\r\n\r\nAdds `-loglevelalways=1` option so that you get `[net:debug]`, `[all:info]`, `[all:warning]` etc, which might be helpful for automated parsing, or just if you like everything to be consistent. Defaults to off to reduce noise in the default config, and to avoid unnecessary changes on upgrades.\r\n\r\nChanges the behaviour of `LogPrintLevel(CATEGORY, BCLog::Level::Info, ...)` to be logged unconditionally, rather than only being an additional optional logging level in addition to trace and debug. Does not change the behaviour of `LogPrintLevel(NONE, Debug, ...)` and `LogPrintLevel(NONE, Trace, ...)` being no-ops.",

      "body": "Hi AJ, this is a draft, and there will be some more changes which may address your concerns.\r\n\r\n> > Make them always accept log categories to make it possible to only log messages from a particular component.\r\n>\r\n> Being able to avoid logging critical messages is adding a bug, not a feature.\r\n\r\nAgree, but the idea here is not to discard log messages, the idea just is to attach meaningful metadata to log messages so they can be filtered by component.\r\n\r\n> > Make them less verbose by not requiring BCLog category constants to be specified in individual log prints\r\n>\r\n> \"+841 -626\" and adding a dummy parameter to most calls does not make things less verbose, and it's also much harder to search for net related logging when the individual log statements just say `m_log` rather than `BCLog::NET`.\r\n\r\nI can probably make the description clearer, but the idea here is that this will make the code less noisy:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-LogPrintLevel(BCLog::NET, BCLog::Level::Warning, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n+LogWarning(log, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is true this sacrifices ability to grep by category constants in the source code, and maybe in your judgement that is an unacceptable cost? But in my opinion, if we ever using same category constants in disparate parts of source code, or different category constants in the same part of the source code, it means source code is badly organized and we should fix that instead of resorting to a coping mechanism of searching for constants instead of searching by source path. In my experience, I've haven't used logging frameworks that have encouraged category constants to be scattered and mixed like this, and I don't think it is a good idea.\r\n\r\nThe \"+841 -626\" refactoring is definitely :hankey:-y and I plan to drop it from this PR. The change to the log macros is meant to facilitate that refactoring, not the other way around. I do think we should stop relying on the global logging instance for libbitcoinkernel code, but probably can keep using it elsewhere.\r\n\r\n> > Make them compatible with wallet logging, which includes the wallet name in log messages\r\n>\r\n> The only thing needed here is renaming from `Printf` to `Info`...\r\n\r\nProbably something is lost in communication here, but the idea is to let wallet code use same LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(), LogWarning(), LogError() macros other code uses. It just adds a little formatting hook so the wallet name is automatically included when the log source is the wallet. This way full functionality of #29256 is available to the wallet and we can drop WalletLogPrintf and not have dedicated wallet logging functions.\r\n\r\n",
