    "body": "This implements mempool validation logic for fee-bumping transactions using CPFP and RBFing mempool transactions within a package, and the combination of both (i.e. a child in a package can pay to RBF its parents' conflicts). This does not implement package relay; there are no P2P changes.\r\n\r\nFor more info, see full proposal [gist](https://gist.github.com/glozow/dc4e9d5c5b14ade7cdfac40f43adb18a).\r\n\r\n**Package Mempool Accept Progress**:\r\n- [x] #21062\r\n- [x] #20833\r\n- [x] #21800\r\n- [x] #22675 \r\n- [x] #23381\r\n- [x] #22674\r\n- [x] #23804\r\n- [x] #24152\r\n- [x] #24836 \r\n- [ ] #25038\r\n\r\nNote that, until package relay exists, fee-bumped package transactions that are otherwise too-low-fee won't go any further than the user's mempool. This PR doesn't expose the package validation codepath to users because it would be misleading.",

In that sense, our policy changes because it is no longer all-or-nothing. I would still call it \"atomic\" because it either decides (1) all transactions may be submitted to mempool or (2) there should be no change to the mempool. Importantly, we deduplicate by txid rather than wtxid - a transaction with the same nonwitness data should be sufficient to validate the descendants in the package.\r\n\r\nI consider this a prerequisite to _submission_ of packages to mempool, because it would be a rather annoying limitation if we couldn't tell that the package was already partially in the mempool. It could also be problematic if someone could submit the transaction with a different witness to cause the package to be rejected.",

          "body": "This PR implements a function to calculate mempool ancestors for a package and enforces ancestor/descendant limits on them as a whole. It reuses a portion of `CalculateMemPoolAncestors()`; there's also a small refactor to move the reused code into a generic helper function. Instead of calculating ancestors and descendants on every single transaction in the package and their ancestors, we use a \"worst case\" heuristic, treating every transaction in the package as each other's ancestor and descendant. This may overestimate everyone's counts, but is still pretty accurate in the our main package use cases, in which at least one of the transactions in the package is directly related to all the others (e.g. 1 parent + 1 child, multiple parents with 1 child, or chains).\r\n\r\nNote on Terminology: While \"package\" is often used to describe groups of related transactions _within_ the mempool, here, I only use package to mean the group of not-in-mempool transactions we are currently validating.\r\n\r\n#### Motivation\r\n\r\nIt would be a potential DoS vector to allow submission of packages to mempool without a proper guard for mempool ancestors/descendants. In general, the purpose of mempool ancestor/descendant limits is to limit the computational complexity of dealing with families during removals and additions. We want to be able to validate multiple transactions on top of the mempool, but also avoid these scenarios:\r\n\r\n- We underestimate the ancestors/descendants during package validation and end up with extremely complex families in our mempool (potentially a DoS vector).\r\n- We expend an unreasonable amount of resources calculating everyone's ancestors and descendants during package validation.",

      "body": "I have some concerns around what semantics are desired for bypassing the fee rate checks for a single transaction and using a notion of package fee rate instead.\r\n\r\nI think the logic here — of using the descendant fee rate as an alternate to the transaction’s fee rate — is insufficient for preventing free relay.  Consider a 3 transaction package where one child transaction C has two parents, A and B, all of equal size.  Suppose A and B are zero-fee transactions and C has a fee rate of 2.  Then each of A and B would evaluate to having a fee rate of 1 (with C), but as a package the fee rate would be just 2/3.  If the mempool min fee or min relay fee is 1, then this package would make it in despite being below the required fee rate.\r\n\r\nI think this type of issue may be somewhat difficult to avoid if we don’t tailor our semantics to the use case(s) we are trying to support.  Right now, if I understand correctly, we don’t enforce any particular topology on the packages we accept — in fact I think the package acceptance logic would even accept unrelated transactions as well?  One idea I had was to require the whole package’s fee rate to be above the min relay and mempool min fee as well, but that doesn’t work very well if we allow someone to bundle in an unrelated high fee transaction to “pay” for some low fee rate package.\r\n\r\nWe could check that a package is connected (from a graph theory perspective) as a condition for acceptance, but that is also not quite sufficient for achieving the semantics that I think we want.  For instance, if we are processing some package that has a sub graph of transactions which would not make it in on its own, we probably wouldn’t want to admit that whole graph?  I’m not quite sure.  It seems like if there is a detachable sub graph that would get evicted shortly after acceptance because it’s below the mempool min fee, that might still admit some kind of free relay problem, similar to the issue with unrelated transactions.\r\n\r\nMy previous approach to the package relay problem was to define packages in a future p2p protocol extension as being the set of unconfirmed ancestors of a single target transaction.  If that is sufficient for the use cases we are currently trying to support, then I think that simplifies the concerns a great deal — in this simple case I believe we could just look at two things: (a) check the target transaction’s own fee rate is sufficient to get in, and (b) check that the entire ancestor package for that target transaction also has a total fee rate sufficient to get in.  (Of course we’d have to add a check that validates a package only contains ancestor transactions of the target, too.)\r\n\r\nThe other benefit of using a target transaction’s ancestors as how we define a package is that it lines up better with how the mining algorithm currently works.\r\n\r\nIf multiple children paying for multiple parents is some desired use case, I’m not sure the mempool and mining code are set up well enough to support that, so it would be helpful to analyze those use cases better to make sure our implementation will work okay.",

      "body": "Thank you for the thoughtful review @sdaftuar!\r\n\r\n> I think the logic here — of using the descendant fee rate as an alternate to the transaction’s fee rate — is insufficient for preventing free relay. Consider a 3 transaction package where one child transaction C has two parents, A and B, all of equal size. Suppose A and B are zero-fee transactions and C has a fee rate of 2. Then each of A and B would evaluate to having a fee rate of 1 (with C), but as a package the fee rate would be just 2/3. If the mempool min fee or min relay fee is 1, then this package would make it in despite being below the required fee rate.\r\n\r\nGreat point. I had been thinking of descendant feerate as a good marker since that's how we evict from mempool, but it is imperfect: I think we already have the case where a transaction's ancestor score is too low to be mined, but descendant score too high to be evicted. And it's additionally problematic with package relay.\r\n\r\nA proposal: if the mempool is intended to store the best candidates for mining, then we should evict in the opposite order we include in blocks, which is ancestor score.\r\nSo a transaction's `minerscore = max([ancestorfeerate(tx) for tx in {itself, all its descendants}])`. (This is with the current mining code - I suppose the definition of `minerscore` would be updated if/when block template creation changes).\r\n\r\nIf we replaced descendant feerate with `minerscore`, would that solve this problem? We go through the package, calculate everyone's ancestor feerate (including in-package and in-mempool ancestors), then we calculate everyone's `minerscore` based on that? Everyone's `minerscore` must surpass the min mempool/relay feerate. I think, then, it might not be necessary to specify/figure out which transactions are sponsees and which ones are sponsors?\r\n\r\n(Very far down the line, but just throwing a thought out there: considering feefilters with package relay, I think we would also want to use [unmodified] `minerscore` for feefiltering as well).",

Imagine this scenario: the mempool has a very large, very low fee rate transaction A, with children B and C.  C also is a child of another low feerate parent D.\r\n\r\nIt is possible then that B has such a high feerate that A and B would be selected for the next block, and then that C and D would be selected as well (once A is paid for by B, C's ancestor feerate score would go up).  However, if A is in fact very large, then C's own ancestor fee rate could be quite low, so that D's `minerscore` could be very small.  This might mean that D and C could be evicted if the mempool were full, even if they would be selected for the next block!\r\n\r\n(As an aside I think the worst-case computation required to maintain this score would be worse than the status quo, too -- going from O(n) to O(n^2) to update statistics in the mempool when transactions are added/removed, where n = ancestor/descendant count.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nHowever regarding the heuristic we use for admitting a package to the mempool, I think using this max-ancestor-feerate-of-descendants as an additional check that we compare to the min-relay-fee and mempool-min-fee probably does work.  It might mean that packages which include a transaction that would be relying on some in-mempool-sibling to pay for a low fee parent might not make it in, but if that's not a use case we're worried about then probably this is fine (if conservative)?\r\n\r\nThat seems to be a generalization of what I had proposed; I had suggested requiring a single ancestor-package that passes the fee rate check in total, while you're saying we can just require that every transaction in the package be part of some ancestor package that would pass the fee rate check.  I'll give that more thought but it seems like a plausible solution.\r\n\r\nEDIT: One additional thought, assuming this idea works at all I think it ought to be sufficient to restrict the calculation of the score to the package transactions alone.  That is, for each transaction, calculate its fee rate for mempool acceptance as `max([in-package-ancestor-fee-rate(tx) for tx in {itself, descendants}]`, where the `in-package-ancestor-fee-rate(tx)` is defined to be the `min(tx fee rate, tx's fee rate including in-package ancestors)`.  And then for each transaction in the package, evaluate that fee rate against the mempool min fee and the min relay fee.  The idea is that we only need to ensure that we're paying enough to justify relay of the transactions -- when the network gets busier, the mempool min fee goes up so as long as the new transaction packages being relayed are continuing to have their fee rates go up too, that should be good enough to prevent free relay.  There shouldn't be any need to look at the fee rates of the transactions that are already in the mempool.",

          "body": "Fixes #22964\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis is a small part of the work to accomplish what I described in 972c5166ee685447a6d4bf5e501b07a0871fba85:\r\n```\r\nOver time, we should probably move these mutable global state variables\r\ninto ChainstateManager or CChainState so it's easier to reason about\r\ntheir lifecycles.\r\n```\r\n\r\n`::UnloadBlockIndex` manually resets a subset of our mutable globals in addition to unloading the `ChainstateManager` and clearing the mempool. The need for this manual reset (AFAICT) arises out of the fact that many of these globals are closely related to the block index (hence `::UnloadBlockIndex`), and need to be reset with it.\r\n\r\nI've shot this \"manual reset\" gun at my foot several times while doing the de-globalize chainman work.\r\n\r\nThankfully, now that we have a `BlockManager` class that owns the block index, these globals should be moved under that class so that they can live and die with the block index. These moves, along with making the block index non-heap-based, eliminates:\r\n1. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3585b521392c5b2c855c3ba6dc9b7d2a171b3710 The need to reason about when we need to manually call `::UnloadBlockIndex` (this decision can at times seem almost arbitrary)\r\n2. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f741623c25455c20bff9eb1ddd10a4ac84dc5655 The need to have an `::UnloadBlockIndex` or explicit `~ChainstateManager` at all",

          "body": "This PR does not change behavior. It extracts the BIP125 logic into helper functions (and puts them in the policy/rbf* files). This enables three things - I think each one individually is pretty good:\r\n\r\n- Implementation of package RBF (see #22290). I want it to be as close to BIP125 as possible so that it doesn't become a distinct fee-bumping mechanism. Doing these move-only commits first means the diff is mostly mechanical to review, and I just need to create a function that mirrors the single transaction validation.\r\n- We will be able to isolate and test our RBF logic alone. Recently, there have been some discussions on discrepancies between our code and BIP125, as well as proposals for improving it. Generally, I think making this code more modular and de-bloating validation.cpp is probably a good idea.\r\n- Witness Replacement (replacing same-txid-different-wtxid when the witness is significantly smaller and therefore higher feerate) in a BIP125-similar way. Hopefully it can just be implemented with calls to the rbf functions (i.e. `PaysForRBF`) and an edit to the relevant mempool entries.",

Fixing such bugs is cumbersome because it involves:\r\n* Noticing the failure\r\n* Fetching and reading the log to determine the test case that failed\r\n* Adding a `self.sync_all()` where it was forgotten\r\n* Spamming out a pr and waiting for review, which is already sparse\r\n\r\nAlso, writing a linter to catch those is not possible, nor is review effective in finding these bugs prior to merge.\r\n\r\nFix all future intermittent races caused by a missing sync_block call by calling `sync_all` implicitly after each `generate*`, unless opted out. This ensures that the code is race-free (with regards to blocks) when the tests pass once, instead of our current approach where the code can never be guaranteed to be race-free.",

          "body": "Erlay Project Tracking: #28646\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation of  [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518) , using primitives in the BIP-330 (see the updated spec  [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki) ). Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670).\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I’ll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n* save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n* increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n* improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\n### How to review\r\n\r\nI suggest doing `make clean && autogen.sh && configure` before you try building it locally.",

          "body": "This PR is on top of #22867 which adds test coverage relevant to this PR, and motivates it by highlighting some of the behavior this improves upon.\r\n\r\nIt aims to resolve issue #22209 as well as [CVE-2021-31876](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-31876)\r\n> Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- As a followup to this PR I think some fuzz testing would be useful.\r\n- Also an optimization followup can be done, putting some stricter bounds on `IsRBFOptIn` when it invokes `CalculateMemPoolAncestors`. However, I don't do that in this PR to keep it as simple as possible, and I don't think it's necessary. a) default mempool limits are much stricter than BIP125 Rule 5's `MAX_BIP125_REPLACEMENT_CANDIDATES{100}`, because `DEFAULT_DESCENDANT_LIMIT == 25`. b) I don't see a major performance tradeoff (please double check me). I think https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/mempool_updatefromblock.py is a good worst-case scenario stress test for additional runtime required to check for inherited signaling, and this test seems to run in approx the same amount of time after this PR. Which seems acceptable to me, and not a risk for a DOS vector. But again, please be critical of this in the review. I also noticed #23621 when testing, and would like to see where that lands before I try any optimization.",

This is done in three commits, with the first commit cleaning up some code, the second commit adding the DISALLOW_NEGATION flag, and the next commit disabling the ALLOW_{INT|BOOL|STRING} flags.\r\n\r\nNone of the changes affect behavior in any way.",

It extracts some BIP125 logic into policy/rbf:\r\n\r\n- Defines a constant for specifying the maximum number of mempool entries we'd consider replacing by RBF\r\n- Calls the available `SignalsOptInRBF` function instead of manually iterating through inputs\r\n- Moves the logic for getting the list of conflicting mempool entries to a helper function\r\n- Also does a bit of preparation for future moves - moving declarations around, etc\r\nAlso see #22677 for addressing the circular dependency.",

Focus is on highlighting confusing/inconsistent behavior that I think we need to consider as we move forward with multiple PRs (and different approaches to BIP125 in general) that are under review.\r\n\r\nThis PR also splits tests out of #22698 (which I've made a draft for now until some related PRs are merged) as they are generally useful and highlight some behavior I think is worth considering.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I do not see any reason we can't eliminate all these inconsistencies while keeping inherited signaling, which is what #22698 does. But either way, making it clear in tests at least motivates a longer-term fix",

In order to do that, the amounts for the utxos have to be scaled down in two sub-tests first (`test_doublespend_chain` and `test_doublespend_tree`, see first two commits), since we need amounts passed to `make_utxo` than can be funded by only one input. For creating UTXOs with a value of 50 BTC, we'd need to implement a method for consolidating multiple utxos into one first, which seems to be overkill.\r\n\r\nNote that after this PR's change, there is only one sub-test left (`test_rpc`) that needs the wallet compiled into bitcoind.",

      "body": "Hi @sdaftuar, regarding [your comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22290#issuecomment-865208890):\r\n\r\n> Consider a 3 transaction package where one child transaction C has two parents, A and B, all of equal size. Suppose A and B are zero-fee transactions and C has a fee rate of 2. Then each of A and B would evaluate to having a fee rate of 1 (with C), but as a package the fee rate would be just 2/3. If the mempool min fee or min relay fee is 1, then this package would make it in despite being below the required fee rate.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting problem, after some thought I wrote a little demo to better understand these concepts, and I think it addresses some of these questions. I thought you and @glozow might find this helpful:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/LarryRuane/bitcoin_package_accept_demo",

          "body": "**Note: this PR has been superseded by #28948 (v3) and #28984 (package RBF)**\r\n\r\nSee #27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 2 projects: v3 policy and package RBF. Mailing list posts: [package RBF 1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019464.html) and [V3 + package RBF 2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html). It stems from a long discussion about RBF pinning, across a [mailing list thread](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html) and [gist](https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff).\r\n\r\nV3 Policy: A set of policy rules applied to transactions with their `nVersion` field set to 3. Namely, it allows users to opt in to more restrictive descendant limits for shared transactions. If adopted by many nodes in the network, V3 mitigates various RBF pinning attacks. See doc/policy/version3_transactions.md for the exact rules and rationale, and [these review club notes](bitcoincore.reviews/25038) for more background and discussion.\r\n\r\nPackage RBF: In addition to allowing a child to pay for its parents within the package, also allow the child to pay for replacing the parent's conflicts. For example, this allows LN users to replace commitment transactions existing in the mempool, simply by broadcasting their respective commitment transactions with a high-fee child. The commitment transactions can be signed with 0 fees, which means no overpaying.\r\n\r\nFAQ: is v3 still helpful even with cluster mempool (#27677) ?\r\n\r\n- Rule 3 pinning: This is addressed with v3 but not really with cluster mempool (descendant allowance is still too permissive).\r\n- Package RBF and ACP pinning: This PR allows for package RBF with v3 packages. V3 has an effective \"cluster limit\" of 2 which makes it very cheap to calculate the mining score of a v3 transaction. With cluster mempool, which also makes it easier to calculate mining score, we could have package RBF for non-v3 transactions.\r\n- Allowing 0fee transactions: This PR allows v3 transactions to be below minimum relay feerate, provided they are CPFP'd. This is because the simplified topology allows us to avoid situations like the ones described in #26933. With cluster mempool, we can allow this for non-v3 transactions.",
