      "body": "> It was claimed that this speeds up the build. Is this true?\r\n\r\nI've found GitHub builds are 10 mins faster (Appveyor between 50-60 mins, GH between 40-50 mins). GH also lets builds run over 1 hr and permits parallel jobs (I know the Bitcoin Core CI job has a special arrangement with AppVeyor but jobs on my fork regularly timeout).\r\n\r\n> There were concerns that we shouldn't put all eggs in one basket (GitHub), but it seems they are free and for appveyor we pay 50$ per month for two parallel jobs\r\n\r\nA possible plan is:\r\n\r\n - Enable GitHub Actions build for `master` only and leave AppVeyor in place (I believe the \"tick\" for a PR will depend on whether GH Actions is enabled for PR's or not).\r\n - If no problems enable GH Actions for PR's. That will impact contributors as they now have three CI systems that need to pass to get a green tick,\r\n - If no problems evaluate whether it's worth cancelling AppVeyor and saving the $50/month.",

This is not what we want and it might be better to disable the Action. ~~while I track down why this behaviour occurs.~~\r\n\r\nUpdate: Most likely cause for the behaviour is that GitHub triggers the Action on every event and then lets the workflow file filter them. By setting the `Enable local Actions only for this repository` permission it causes an error immediately since the `ci.yml` file on this repo is using 3rd party actions. The Action is going to permanently fail until the permission is changed or 3rd party actions are removed. Recommendation is to disable pending further investigation into permissions.\r\n\r\nSetting the permission to `Enable local and third party Actions for this repository` results in my fork only triggering on Pull requests. I think that permission level simply means 3rd party actions like the cache and checkout ones can be used in a workflow file. But until we know for sure it rules out potential for commits might be best to disable Actions again.",

(https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/451#issuecomment-746752833)\r\n - MacOS builds? (MacOS relies on clang anyway, so not this is not as interesting as MSVC.)\r\n - Coverage reports #705 \r\n - Reducing configuration options to keep the test matrix manageable, see e.g., https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/596#issuecomment-495908309\r\n\r\nIs there anything else you would like to see?\r\n\r\nIf we want to work on this, this is a good time to think about the CI platform. I don't mind Travis and it's reasonably stable in the past months but if we think that a different (or additional) provider is a better fit, it's better to discuss this before we start working on these issues.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Bitcoin is currently looking into GitHub Actions for Windows at least:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17803\r\n",

I'd like to be really sure that this is not possible before activating third-party actions.\r\n\r\nThat's not possible as I understand it.\r\n\r\nThis blog post clarifies that pull requests from forks only get a read-only token:\r\nhttps://github.blog/2020-08-03-github-actions-improvements-for-fork-and-pull-request-workflows/#improvements-for-public-repository-forks\r\n  (see in particular the first paragraph in the second section... the entire section section is about dealing with workflows that need write access **but currently do not have it** ):\r\n> In order to protect public repositories for malicious users we run all pull request workflows raised from repository forks with a read-only token and no access to secrets. \r\n\r\nBut the docs are bad here. That behavior is not at all clear from \r\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow and \r\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#permissions-for-the-github_token ... Maybe I'll create a PR to their docs. If we're in doubt, we could just try on a new repo. \r\n\r\nWere there further concerns? If not, GitHub Actions is again an interesting option. (Not saying we should do this, I'm at the moment just looking into options for secp256k1 (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/707).",

We need to switch from travis.org to travis.com anyway because apparently they're moving over resources to travis.com. But travis.com [has unacceptable permissions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17802#issuecomment-718857563). Apparently [github actions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18031) had similar issues - not sure if that's still the case or what they're specifically referring to. @erikarvstedt Do you have experience with Github Actions? I haven't read up on this really, but short google search revealed that generally it seems to be preferred over travis.",
