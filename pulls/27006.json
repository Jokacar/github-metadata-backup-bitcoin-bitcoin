          "body": "The current procedure for building the block filter index involves processing filters one at a time;\r\nReading blocks, undo data, and previous headers from disk sequentially.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new mechanism to perform the work concurrently. Dividing the filters\r\ngeneration workload among a pool of workers that can be configured by the user,\r\nsignificantly increasing the speed of the index construction process.\r\n\r\nThe same concurrent processing model has been applied to the transactions index as well.\r\n\r\nThe newly introduced init flag `-indexworkers=<n>` enables the concurrent sync\r\nbehavior.\r\nWhere \"n\" is the number of worker threads that will be spawned at startup to create ranges\r\nof block filters during the initial sync process. Destroying the workers pool once the\r\ninitial sync completes.\r\nNote: by default, the parallelized sync process is not enabled.\r\n\r\nNow the juicy part:\r\nIn my computer, with the node in debug mode and on IBD, with `-indexworkers=4`, the\r\nblock filter index generation took less than an hour. While, in master, the sync took more than 7 hours.\r\n\r\nImportant Note:\r\nAs the access to the block data on disk is protected by `cs_main`, this new feature runs substantially\r\nfaster when the node is not in IBD.\r\n\r\nFootnote:\r\nThis is part of a larger project :).",

The networking threads (and pretty much the entire node) shouldn't get blocked because the user called the `getblock` RPC command.\r\n\r\nBut, the usage of an exclusive mutex here still means no concurrent block data access.

      "body": "Hey dergoegge, thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\n> Approach NACK for adding new globals. It is not worth going with a worse design to \"rush in\" an improvement for a feature that may or may not happen ([#26966](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26966)). I would prefer to go with a more sustainable approach from the get go, otherwise this will need to be refactored in the long run.\r\n\r\nNo rush here.\r\n[#26966](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26966) is only one clear use case. It isn’t the main one actually, there are other areas that shouldn’t be locking the net messages reception / validation thread because of a disk read: e.g. “getblock”, “getblocktxn” and compact block net messages, the current indexes sync process (all of them), `getblock`/`gettxoutproof` RPC commands. They all are locking the node at every single block read.\r\n\r\n> I don't see why the mutex could not be a member of BlockManager. Like you say in [#27006 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27006#issuecomment-1481222148), giving BlockManager its own internal lock(s) instead of cs_main is the preferable long term design.\r\n\r\nI'm not opposed to it but there are few problems with that approach:\r\n\r\n- `BlockStorage` depends on `CBlockIndex` and not in the other way around, so moving the mutex to `BlockStorage` would leave `CBlockIndex` members with no thread safety analysis annotations.\r\n\r\n- The `ReadBlockFromDisk` and `UndoReadFromDisk` functions are currently global functions. They do not have access to the BlockManager class members.\r\n\r\nThe second point can be fixed by refactoring the functions into the class but the first one is more complex. We have to avoid adding a `chain.h` <-> `blockstorage.h` cyclic dependency.",

So don't care where we place `CBlockIndex`, it will need blockstorage dependency to use the thread analysis annotation. Which will cause a cyclic dependency.\r\n\r\nA possible solution would be to place the mutex in a separate file. So blockstorage and `CBlockIndex` can include it independently.\r\n\r\nOr.. thinking out loud: something somewhat \"radical\" could be move `nFile`, `nData` and `nUndoData` members out of `CBlockIndex`, into the blockstorage class. We could place them into an unordered map <block_id, FileData>.\r\n\r\nWhich, in a first glance, sounds quite positive. As we are currently mixing two concepts into the same container. `CBlockIndex` currently is used to store the chain in a sort of linked list structure while it also contains the position of the block data on disk.",

The reason is that the validation interface queue is limited to 10 tasks per time. This means that no\r\nmore than 10 blocks can be waiting for the wallet(s) to be processed while we are synchronizing the chain\r\n(activating the best chain to be more precise).\r\nWhich can be a bottleneck if blocks arrive and are processed faster from the network than what they are \r\nprocessed by the wallet(s).\r\n\r\nSo, by skipping not relevant blocks in the wallet's IBD scanning process, we will also improve the chain \r\nsynchronization time.",

          "body": "The `PopulateAndValidateSnapshot` function introduced in f6e2da5fb7c6406c37612c838c998078ea8d2252 from #19806 has been setting fake `nTx` and `nChainTx` values that can show up in RPC results (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29328) and make `CBlockIndex` state hard to reason about, because it is difficult to know whether the values are real or fake.\r\n\r\nRevert to previous behavior of setting `nTx` and `nChainTx` to 0 when the values are unknown, instead of faking them. Also drop no-longer needed `BLOCK_ASSUMED_VALID` flag.\r\n\r\nDropping the faked values also fixes assert failures in the `CheckBlockIndex` `(pindex->nChainTx == pindex->nTx + prev_chain_tx)` check that could happen previously if forked or out-of-order blocks before the snapshot got submitted while the snapshot was being validated. The PR includes two commits adding tests for these failures and describing them in detail.\r\n\r\nCompatibility note: This change could cause new `-checkblockindex` failures if a snapshot was loaded by a previous version of Bitcoin Core and not fully validated, because fake `nTx` values will have been saved to the block index. It would be pretty easy to avoid these failures by adding some compatibility code to `LoadBlockIndex` and changing `nTx` values from 1 to 0 when they are fake (when `(pindex->nStatus & BLOCK_VALID_MASK) < BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS`), but a little simpler not to worry about being compatible in this case.",

          "body": "Based on #25665.\r\n\r\nCurrently functions issuing fatal errors call the `fatalError` notification method to issue a shutdown procedure. This makes it hard for higher level functions to figure out if an error deeper in the call stack occurred. For users of the kernel it might also be difficult to assert which function call issued a fatal error if they are being run concurrently. If the kernel would eventually be used by external users, getting fatal error information through a callback instead of function return values would also be cumbersome and limiting. Unit, bench, and fuzz tests currently don't have a way to effectively test against fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThis patch set is an attempt to make fatal error handling in the kernel code more transparent. Fatal errors are now passed up the call stack through `util::Result<T, FatalError>` failure values. A previous attempt at this by theuni always immediately returned failure values if a function call returned a failure. However, this is not always desirable (see discussion [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27866#discussion_r1256378064)). Sometimes, further operations can still be completed even if a fatal error was issued. The solution to this is that these \"ignored\" errors are still moved through `util::Result`'s error string values with its `.MoveMessages` method, even while a failure value in the result is not present.\r\n\r\nNext to some smaller behavior changes, the most significant change is that the issuing of a shutdown procedure is delayed until a potential fatal error is handled as opposed to immediately when it is first encountered. Another effect is that potential fatal errors are now asserted in the bench, fuzz and unit tests. Some of the currently not immediately returned fatal errors need some further scrutiny. These are marked with a `TODO (fatal error)` comment and could be tackled in a later PR.\r\n\r\nTo validate this approach a new clang-tidy check is introduced. It implements the following checks:\r\n\r\n1. If a function calls another function with a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` return type, its return type has to be `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` too, or it has to handle the value returned by the function with one of `CheckFatal`, `HandleFatalError`,\r\n`UnwrapFatalError`, or `CheckFatalFailure`.\r\n2. In functions returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` a call to a function returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` needs to propagate the value by either:\r\n   - Returning it immediately\r\n   - Assigning it immediately to an existing result with `.MoveMessages()` or `.Set()`\r\n   - Eventually passing it as an argument to a `.MoveMessages()`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587) and is a step towards stage 2, creating a more refined kernel API.",

I didn’t do this now because `nChainTx` isn’t terrible IMO, just outdated, but happy to do this if people think it’s valuable while I touch these lines.~~ This is included now.\r\n\r\nThere was also talk about a memory-optimized solution for this by combining nChainTx and nTx: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29258#issuecomment-1929388354 I tried out an approach to this here: https://github.com/fjahr/bitcoin/commit/b9382041e541569a2b8ec7ed1f7fb10aa602277f (patch is on top of the changes here), still rough, requires more security checks and cleanup of docs but it works (tests pass) and I am happy to take this route if it’s preferred.",

          "title": "kernel, refactor: return error status on all fatal errors",
          "body": "Return util::Result objects from all functions that can trigger fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThere are many validation functions that handle failures by calling `AbortNode` and triggering shutdowns, without returning error information to their callers. This makes error handling in libbitcoinkernel application code difficult, because the only way to handle these errors is to register for [notification callbacks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/kernel/notifications_interface.h). Improve this by making all functions that trigger fatal errors return util::Result objects with the error information.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a pure refactoring that returns extra result information from functions without changing their behavior. It's a possible alternative to and subset of #29642, which adds similar return information but also makes behavior changes and exposes a FatalError type.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #25665.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`fa31903c7eeb` refactor, kernel: Add FlushStatus / FlushResult types](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/fa31903c7eeb25d2aafd2d611901abb1a94dc022)\r\n- [`9cec4d377c52` refactor: Add InfoType field to util::Result](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/9cec4d377c527ca4ebb3b1db410dc519ab6c7179)\r\n- [`56f3306d3efa` refactor, blockstorage: Return FlushResult from flush methods](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/56f3306d3efa3380ab8e9c7d5e9c89a7d8795616)\r\n- [`d5da19a3e1e6` refactor, blockstorage: Return fatal errors from block writes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/d5da19a3e1e6860a09f5f769b82dac609be762f6)\r\n- [`fb9385f9017b` refactor, blockstorage: Return fatal error from LoadBlockIndex](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/fb9385f9017b5bf688cbfdf4c07d511a7674db14)\r\n- [`396b26eebd25` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from FlushStateToDisk](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/396b26eebd259faacfb54056a65541a717e6742c)\r\n- [`b40dbb105125` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from mempool accept functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/b40dbb105125a33845426b105cf0f90315c77192)\r\n- [`3f7cd8f8a2b5` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from assumeutxo snapshot functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/3f7cd8f8a2b5f9070f9d5249a2228275dd55ba39)\r\n- [`adc544116468` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from block connect functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/adc5441164688df60b2f558779ceb7c7f104af8b)\r\n- [`a4d8ebb939bc` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from activate best chain functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/a4d8ebb939bc39d0ee131f2baec7dc6d61a38292)\r\n- [`94da23b87daf` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from new block functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/94da23b87dafc794aca206371666930ee494f2d9)\r\n- [`417851b9bd20` refactor, blockstorage: Return fatal error from ImportBlocks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/417851b9bd205a04a8cd068988d64431b6b5ac21)\r\n- [`edc9fd110cc4` refactor, validation: Return more errors from VerifyDB](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/edc9fd110cc4786bc87a01662ea39ce599f1a070)\r\n",

The only time where the `CBlockIndex` file position can be modified during the entire software lifecycle is pruning, and it's done only once.

Maybe there should be a getter that returns all three values, similar to how there's a setter (`CBlockIndex::SetFileData`) than sets all three atomically.\r\n\r\n@LarryRuane I didn't add it merely to not introduce that many changes but could be done too. The members set is guarded by `cs_main` (for now) so there is no possible race.\r\n\r\n> Starting to feel like a struct for those 3 members would be appropriate\r\n\r\nWhy exactly?. So far in the code, we either want the block data position or the block undo data position, we don't get both at the same time because they represent different files on disk (thus why they are returned inside `FlatFilePos`, the struct groups only one of them with the file number).\r\n\r\nIn other words, nData + nFile maps to a \"blk<nFile>.dat\", while nUndoData + nFile maps to an specific \"rev<nFile>.dat\".",
