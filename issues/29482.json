    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nWhen `bitcoind` is started with the following configuration files:\r\n\r\n`settings.json`:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"listen\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`bitcoin.conf`:\r\n```\r\nlisten=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen it does not listen. This is expected. Options from `settings.json` override ones from `bitcoin.conf`. Both options co-exist in `ArgsManager::m_settings::rw_settings` (listen=0) and `ArgsManager::m_settings::ro_config` (listen=1). Then `ArgsManager::GetBoolArg()` selects the value from `rw_settings`.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nWhat should be the behavior with the following?\r\n\r\n`settings.json`:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"listen\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`bitcoin.conf`:\r\n```\r\nlistenonion=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that for consistency with the above, it should start and not listen. That is, `listenonion=1` from `bitcoin.conf` should be overriden / set to 0. But instead `bitcoind` refuses to start:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bitcoind\r\nError: Cannot set -listen=0 together with -listenonion=1\r\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nSee above.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nmaster@7143d4388407ab3d12005e55a02d5e8f334e4dc9\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nany\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",

It would be nice to log or show a warning in this case.\r\n\r\nI think current behavior of treating it like an error is also reasonable, too.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about about the new bug reported in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/567#issuecomment-1962422185 since it is i just a screenshot without steps to reproduce. If that bug is happening without anything specified on the command line or in bitcoin.conf like the original bug https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/567 then that is a real unexpected problem and bug.",
