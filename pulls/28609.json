    "body": "Some incomplete/incorrect state as a result of migration can be mitigated/cleaned up by simply restarting the migrated wallets. We already do this for a wallet when it is migrated, but we do not for the new watchonly and solvables wallets that may be created. This PR introduces this behavior, in addition to creating those wallets initially without an attached chain.\r\n\r\nWhile implementing this, I noticed that not all `CWalletTx` metadata was being copied over to the watchonly wallet and so some data, such as time received, was being lost. This PR fixes this as a side effect of not having a chain attached to the watchonly wallet. A test has also been added.",

          "body": "`InferDescriptor` was not always checking that the pubkey it was placing into the descriptor was an allowed pubkey. For example, given a P2WPKH script that uses an uncompressed pubkey, it would produce a `wpkh()` with the uncompressed key. Additionally, the hybrid key check was only being done for `pk()` scripts, where it should've been done for all scripts.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the key checking into `InferPubkey`. If the key is not valid for the context, then `nullptr` is returned and the inferring will fall through to the defaults of either `raw()` or `addr()`.\r\n\r\nThis also resolves an issue with migrating legacy wallets that contain hybrid pubkeys as such watchonly scripts will become `raw()` or `addr()` and go to the watchonly wallet. Note that a legacy wallet cannot sign for hybrid pubkeys. A test has been added for the migration case.\r\n\r\nAlso added unit tests for `InferDescriptor` itself as the edge cases with that function are not covered by the descriptor roundtrip test.",

          "body": "The benchmark conducted locally showed a ~65% processing time reduction, on a SSD.\r\nResults can be found at the end of the description.\r\n\r\n#### Detailed Description:\r\nThe current wallet migration process performs only individual db writes. Accessing disk to\r\ndelete all legacy records, clone and clean each address book entry for every created wallet,\r\ncreate each new descriptor (with their corresponding master key, caches and key pool), and\r\nalso clone and delete each transaction that requires to be transferred to a different wallet.\r\n\r\nThis work consolidates all individual disk writes into two batch operations. One for the descriptors\r\ncreation from the legacy data and a second one for the execution of the migration process itself.\r\nEfficiently dumping all the information to disk at once atomically at the end of each process.\r\n\r\nThis represent a significant speed up and also a consistency improvement. During migration, we\r\neither want to succeed or fail. No other outcomes should be accepted. We should never leave a\r\npartially migrated wallet on disk and request the user to manually restore the previous wallet from\r\na backup (at least not if we can avoid it).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since db transactions relevant to the key pool generation were also batched, this work\r\nalso speeds up the regular wallet creation process.\r\n\r\n#### Note for Testers:\r\nThe first commit introduces a benchmark for the migration process. This one can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master to compare results pre and post changes.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the benchmark setup may take some time (~70 seconds here) due to the absence\r\nof a batching mechanism for the address generation process (`GetNewDestination()` calls). Which,\r\nI plan to address in a separate PR, just to not continue expanding this PR.\r\n\r\n#### Final Notes:\r\nThis PR is intended to be an \"all-in-one\" solution that's ready for use and testing. In the coming days, \r\nwill start breaking it down into smaller, focused PRs for better manageability and review.\r\n\r\n————————————————————————\r\n\r\nBenchmark on master (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:-----------\r\n|   65,093,884,958.00 |                0.02 |    0.0% |     65.09 | `WalletMigration`\r\n\r\nBenchmark on this branch (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|   22,926,814,750.00 |                0.04 |    0.0% |     22.93 | `WalletMigration`",

But because the migrated wallet is offline (has null `m_chain`), the `confirmed_block_height` and `conflicting_block_height` values in these transactions are -1. These values need to be updated before they are moved to the watchonly wallet, because the watchonly wallet is online, and remains loaded after the migration is complete. Not updating these values could lead to the watchonly wallet returning incorrect information and potentially triggering assert failures.\r\n\r\nThe problem is only temporary since the height values would be refreshed the next time the watchonly wallet is loaded, but it is worth fixing to avoid unpredictable behavior.\r\n\r\nNoticed while reviewing #28542, and looking for other cases where negative confirmed_block_height and conflicting_block_height values might be used.\r\n\r\nAn easy way to test this bug is to revert the bugfix in the second commit. Then the assert added in the third commit will trigger a crash when `getwalletinfo` is called in [`wallet_migration.py`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c9f288244b8d183e09a917025922b99e3368ef78/test/functional/wallet_migration.py#L250)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
