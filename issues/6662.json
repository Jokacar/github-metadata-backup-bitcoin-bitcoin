    "body": "I had a few conflicted transactions in my wallet, so I ran:\n\n```\nbitcoind -zapwallettxes=2\n```\n\nto delete them. After doing so, all my transactions from before January 2014 had a date of January 2014.\n\nUpon checking the source code, I see this line in `CWallet::AddToWallet()` in `wallet/wallet.cpp`:\n\n```\nwtx.nTimeSmart = std::max(latestEntry, std::min(blocktime, latestNow));\n```\n\n`blocktime` is the time I want to see in my transactions, `latestNow` is much bigger, and so the `min()` returns the time I want, but `latestEntry` is January 2014, and so that's the time that is used for all my old transactions.\n\nI'm not entirely clear how the Jan 2014 date is being found, since `-zapwallettxes` is meant to delete all the transactions and rescan to find them again, but it seems that\n\n```\nTxItems txOrdered = OrderedTxItems(acentries);\n```\n\nis finding a transaction from 2014, even after all transactions have been deleted.\n\nI tried replacing the nTimeSmart = max(min()) code with this:\n\n```\nwtx.nTimeSmart = std::min(blocktime, latestNow);\n```\n\nthen re-ran with the -zap flag, and now I see the correct dates next to all of my transactions.\n",

The newly imported key has the label \"ehemals\", The big number for confirmations (in the tooltip) seems to be correct, but the timestamps all show the time of the latest transaction (lieferando) which was there at the time of import.\r\n#### How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so?\r\nHave not reproduced this issue yet (because it takes sooo long). But I have observed other strange things before (data curruption, see: Issue https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11627).\r\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)?\r\nBitcoin core from the ppa used on Ubuntu 17.4 (most recent, I think) Bitcoin core version: v0.15.0.0-g3751912e8e (64-Bit)\r\n### What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)?\r\nUbuntu 17.04 64 bit, Quadcore CPU, 2GB RAM, HDD and SSD (for chainstate).\r\n### Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.\r\nEverything else seems normal. The blockchain was freshly reindexed the 3 days before the import.(to cure the data corruption). The former issue \"data corruption\" was observed on a different computer, I then used a desktop computer. But I use the same (extermal) HDD.\r\n",

The fix is written to have no impact on every realtime scenario and only impact the behaviour during a rescanning process.\r\nThis PR Fixes #20181.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, I don't think that this bug could be triggered with the wallet GUI, because it always proceed with a proper rescan.\r\nBut RPC API provide the possibility to trigger it. I've discovered it, because Specter desktop v0.10.0 was impacted. (https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/issues/680).",

          "body": "Dear Gridcoin wallet devs,\r\n\r\nI'm importing a few private keys / addresses into a new wallet.\r\n\r\nImporting the first private key (here: of the beacon, let's call it _'pk1'_) into a new empty wallet works well regarding the restore of all \"transactions\". But as soon as I import a second private key (let's call it _'pk2'_), all its transactions (after the rescan is complete) get the same date as the most recent 'transaction' related to _pk1_ (here: the last time it rained on the beacon address). After some transactions occurred on an address of the new wallet (let's call it _'add0'_), I restored a copy of the new wallet (its state: with imported _pk1_, but before I had imported _pk2_), imported _pk2_ again, and: all transactions related to _pk2_ get the date of the most recent transaction (now: of _add0_).\r\n\r\nSo I believe it's a general issue and not related to the initial beacon address/private key import. Or is it?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for looking at it!",
