          "body": "This PR attempts to close (or at least help) #26455 (and closed duplicates #26400 #26530).\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nmacOS's `fsync` only flushes writes to the drive, but doesn't ask the drive to *immediately* commit the data to permanent storage (ie - physically write it) ([manpage](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/fsync.2.html)). The data will eventually be physically written, but there are no guarantees when it will happen -- it could be several seconds or more. For a stronger 'immediate-write' guarantee, they offer an `F_FULLFSYNC` option to `fcntl` ([manpage](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/fcntl.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/fcntl:~:text=current%20file%20offset.-,F_FULLFSYNC,-Does%20the%20same)) to accomplish that. This `fsync`-on-macOS behavior has caused [historical problems](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2770#issuecomment-22686426) in this project for macOS builds, so, since then, the `F_FULLSYNC` approach has been used for writing (see #3000).\r\n\r\nHowever, certain external drives or filesystems do not support `fcntl` with `F_FULLFSYNC` option. (And some that *do* supposedly support the option do not actually do it.) These drives/filesystems will typically report `errno` `ENOTSUP` or `ENOTTY`, which is what was reported in the referenced issues. [However, there is no reliable way to determine lack of support](https://github.com/google/leveldb/commit/296de8d5b8e4e57bd1e46c981114dfbe58a8c4fa), so **relying on specific error codes is insufficient**.\r\n\r\nThis bug seems to only be affecting macOS 13 (Ventura) systems, but in theory, any macOS version could be affected.\r\n\r\n### What other projects have done\r\n\r\nOther projects, including [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb/commit/296de8d5b8e4e57bd1e46c981114dfbe58a8c4fa), [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/src/file?name=src/os_unix.c&ci=5c669f5f399fe899#:~:text=If%20the%20FULLFSYNC%20failed%2C%20fall%20back%20to%20attempting%20an%20fsync()), and [MariaDB](https://github.com/MariaDB/server/commit/746fd9fdacc52ccc297db7703ea9288b67138167) have experienced similar issues, and have taken the strategy of falling back on the (less reliable) `fsync` when `F_FULLFSYNC` isn't supported. (See helpful [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/TigerBeetleDB/status/1422855270716293123).) Some (SQLite, MariaDB, LevelDB) fall back to `fsync` on *any* error, and others only fall back on specific errors (BerkeleyDB 4.8 [falls back only on `ENOTSUP`](https://github.com/observerdev/db-4.8.30/blob/3c75267f11336acb1be06bed419e8056cc689d09/os/os_fsync.c#L81-L88), which is why this PR may not fully fix #26455, as the wallet is getting the error `ENOTTY`.)\r\n\r\n### This PR\r\n\r\nI propose to follow that general strategy and fall back on `fsync` if `F_FULLFSYNC` fails for any reason, while preserving both error codes for debugging. \r\n\r\n(I think we should also print the error strings using `SysErrorString` rather than print the raw platform-dependent error codes, but I wanted to keep this PR as atomic as possible and save those changes (4 or 5 lines in addition to these) for another PR (which I'd be happy to submit -- or modify this PR to include).)",
