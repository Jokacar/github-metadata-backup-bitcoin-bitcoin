          "title": "SegWit wallet support",
          "body": "This implements a minimum viable implementation of SegWit wallet support, based on top of #11389, and includes part of the functionality from #11089.\r\n\r\nTwo new configuration options are added:\r\n* `-addresstype`, with options `legacy`, `p2sh`, and `bech32`. It controls what kind of addresses are produced by `getnewaddress`, `getaccountaddress`, and `createmultisigaddress`.\r\n* `-changetype`, with the same options, and by default equal to `-addresstype`, that controls what kind of change is used.\r\n\r\nAll wallet private and public keys can be used for any type of address. Support for address types dependent on different derivation paths will need a major overhaul of how our internal detection of outputs work. I expect that that will happen for a next major version.\r\n\r\nThe above also applies to imported keys, as having a distinction there but not for normal operations is a disaster for testing, and probably for comprehension of users. This has some ugly effects, like needing to associate the provided label to `importprivkey` with each style address for the corresponding key.\r\n\r\nTo deal with witness outputs requiring a corresponding redeemscript in wallet, three approaches are used:\r\n* All SegWit addresses created through `getnewaddress` or multisig RPCs explicitly get their redeemscripts added to the wallet file. This means that downgrading after creating a witness address will work, as long as the wallet file is up to date.\r\n* All SegWit keys in the wallet get an _implicit_ redeemscript added, without it being written to the file. This means recovery of an old backup will work, as long as you use new software.\r\n* All keypool keys that are seen used in transactions explicitly get their redeemscripts added to the wallet files. This means that downgrading after recovering from a backup that includes a witness address will work.\r\n\r\nThese approaches correspond to solutions 3a, 1a, and 5a respectively from https://gist.github.com/sipa/125cfa1615946d0c3f3eec2ad7f250a2. As argued there, there is no full solution for dealing with the case where you both downgrade and restore a backup, so that's also not implemented.\r\n\r\n`dumpwallet`, `importwallet`, `importmulti`, `signmessage` and `verifymessage` don't work with SegWit addresses yet. They're remaining TODOs, for this PR or a follow-up. Because of that, several tests unexpectedly run with `-addresstype=legacy` for now.",
