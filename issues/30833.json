    "title": "28.0rc1 synchronizes much slower on Windows",
    "body": "Bitcoin Core 28.0rc1 (both pre-built and self-built binary) on Windows 10 synchronizes much slower than 27.0 after around block 120,000 when blocks stop being almost empty.\r\n\r\nTime to synchronize to block 300,000: (measured around 10 runs each, alternating between the versions)\r\n27.0: **695 seconds**\r\n28.0rc1: **2760 seconds**\r\n\r\n![28.0rc1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/060a1e18-7f97-4e86-9ba8-5bf867b3510e)\r\n\r\nRunning the Linux pre-built binary in WSL doesn't show the slowdown, so it's probably limited to Windows.\r\n\r\nI'm going to bisect this, but that will definitely take me a while. If anyone suspects a commit/PR that I should look at first that might help.",
