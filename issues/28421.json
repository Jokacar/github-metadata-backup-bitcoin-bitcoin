    "title": "test: Remove feature_txindex_compatibility.py in v27",
    "body": "Since #28195 got merged, all non-test code relating to the legacy txindex (and its migration) has been removed from master.\r\n\r\nAt this point, `feature_txindex_compatibility.py` is just testing whether `-txindex` works successfully when a legacy txindex exists, but as there is no overlap in data structures this feels like a redundant test and I think it can be removed from a future version. Since #28195 is included for v26, I'd [suggest](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28195#discussion_r1311494362) we remove this test for v27.\r\n\r\nHistorical pulls for context:\r\n#13033: introduce new txindex db and migration code\r\n#22626: remove migration code\r\n#23046: add feature_txindex_compatibility.py",
