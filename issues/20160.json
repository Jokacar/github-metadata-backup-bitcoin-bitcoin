    "title": "Proposed Timeline for Legacy Wallet and BDB removal",
    "body": "Here is a proposed timeline for the move from legacy wallets to descriptor wallets, and at the same time, bdb to sqlite, culminating with the removal of both legacy wallets and bdb. Even though the wallet type and the wallet storage format are orthogonal to each other, as noted in #19077, I would like to tie them together for the sake of simplicity when it comes to how we make new wallets and the migration of one type to another.\r\n\r\nThe 4 combinations of type and format are: legacy-bdb, legacy-sqlite, descriptor-bdb, and descriptor-sqlite. While all 4 types will be supported, we will primarily deal with legacy-bdb and descriptor-sqlite. Setting `descriptors=True` in `createwallet` (or checking the Descriptors option in the GUI) will always make a descriptor-sqlite. Setting that to `False` will always make a legacy-bdb.\r\n\r\n- [x] 0.21 (late 2020)\r\n  - [x] Initial release of descriptor type and sqlite format. (#16528, #19077)\r\n  - [x] Descriptor type is experimental with a warning as such (#16528)\r\n  - [x] Only legacy-bdb and descriptor-sqlite will be created (#19077)\r\n- [x] 22.0 (mid 2021)\r\n  - [x] Implement descriptor exports (#20226)\r\n  - [x] Legacy type remains default (no pr needed)\r\n  - [x] Introduce `dump` and `createfromdump` wallet tool commands with an additional `-format` option to specify the wallet type (#19137)\r\n    * Users may use `dump` and then `createfromdump` in order to make legacy-sqlite from legacy-bdb\r\n    * Users may use `dump` and then `createfromdump` in order to make descriptor-bdb from descriptor-sqlite\r\n  - [x] If a wallet specified in conf or command line doesn't exist, don't make a wallet and instead warn (#15454)\r\n- [x] 23.0 (early 2022)\r\n  - [x] Change descriptor type to non-experimental (#23002)\r\n  - [x] Change `createwallet` `descriptors` default to `True` (#23002)\r\n  - [x] Change wallet tool `create` `-descriptors` default to `True` (#23002)\r\n- [x] 24.0 (late 2022)\r\n  - [x] Introduce `migratewallet` command to migrate a legacy-bdb to descriptor-sqlite (#19602)\r\n  - [x] For newly created legacy-bdb wallets, warn that they are deprecated and will soon be unsupported (#24505)\r\n- [ ] 26.0 (late 2023)\r\n  - [ ] Remove `migratewallet` experimental warning #28037 \r\n  - [x] When loading legacy-bdb, descriptor-bdb, or legacy-sqlite wallets, warn that the legacy type and bdb format will soon be unsupported, as applicable. (#27869)\r\n- [ ] 27.0 (early 2024)\r\n  - [ ] Reimplement legacy-bdb to descriptor-sqlite migration (maybe as a separate command or in the wallet tool) to be independent of `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` and BDB (#26596)\r\n  - [ ] For `dump`, implement an independent BDB file loader (this should probably be shared with the previous) (#26606)\r\n  - [ ] Stop creating new legacy-bdb wallets (not yet started)\r\n  - [ ] Make the loading warning louder (not yet started)\r\n  - [ ] Batch DB Writes (@furszy) (not yet started)\r\n- [ ] 28.0 (late 2024)\r\n  - [ ] Stop loading legacy-bdb, descriptor-bdb, legacy-sqlite wallet entirely. Inform users how to migrate (not yet started)\r\n  - [ ] Remove `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` except for the independent migration stuff (not yet started)\r\n  - [ ] Remove BDB except for independent loading for migration stuff (not yet started)\r\n\r\nAdditional improvements that have no target deadline:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Run `--legacy-wallet` and `--descriptors` tests in a single invocation of a functional test case  #20892\r\n- [ ] Caching to improve performance of migrated non-HD descriptor wallets (also perf improvement in general) #26008\r\n- [ ] Backwards compatibility tests fixes for descriptor wallets #28027\r\n\r\nThe migration code will probably be around for a long time/forever.\r\n\r\nNote that we expect users who go through the effort to make a legacy-sqlite or descriptor-bdb wallet to suck it up and deal with the consequences of doing something that isn't really supported. Such users should be able to figure out for themselves how to migrate their wallets. (Maybe `migratewallet` can migrate legacy-sqlite to descriptor-sqlite. bdb to sqlite is way easier than legacy to descriptor).",

Similar to #23446. \r\nAlways mention how to build for the wallet (sqlite) first, then legacy wallets (bdb).\r\n\r\nWhere possible, just use \"wallet\", rather than \"descriptor wallet\". Non-technical\r\nor causal users don't care about whether the wallet is a descriptor wallet or not,\r\nor what it's backed by they just want to build (and or download) and use Bitcoin Core, \r\ncreate a wallet, and accept a payment. Using \"descriptor wallet\" could also imply \r\nthat there is some other not legacy but also not a descriptor wallet alternative,\r\nwhich there is not.\r\n\r\nUsing 2 terms (wallet and legacy wallet), rather than 5 terms (wallet, \r\nlegacy wallet, bdb wallet, sqlite wallet, descriptor wallet) for the same two things\r\nis also much less confusing.\r\n\r\nNote that most builders now likely have to do nothing to get \"wallet support\" as\r\nthere's a decent probability they will already have sqlite installed on their system,\r\nand configure no-longer fails if BDB isn't present and `--disable-wallet` hasn't been passed.",

          "body": "Overall, great doc. I'll capture general feedback here and also open a PR for nits/spelling.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\n- [x] BerkeleyDB is unmaintained _and_ on a deprecation path from Core. Might be worth linking to the proposed deprecation plan: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20160\r\n\r\n- [x] IIRC, sqlite wallets cannot create legacy wallets, only descriptors (it's enforced when creating wallets BDB is on a deprecation path - might be worth mentioning and also\r\nadding a link to the deprecation timeline\r\n\r\n### Wallet Architecture\r\n\r\n- [ ] in `wallet/` doc, perhaps mention bech32m? i believe it will be a supported descriptor in the next release (23.0). Ping @lsilva01 \r\n\r\n### Coin Selection (AvailableCoins)\r\n\r\n- [x] There are three coin selection algos, no? BnB, Knapsack, SRD\r\n- [x] When explaining coin selection, I think it's more accurate to say that BnB, Knapsack, and SRD are all run, and then the most optimal one is chosen based on the WasteMetric - in simple terms, wasteMetric calculates an opportunity cost of spending now vs how expensive this would be to spend later at 10 s/vb (paraphrashing)\r\n- [x] Might also be worth explaining the waste metric in this section\r\n- [ ] It is inaccurate to say Knapsack is a fallback, I think knapsack gets chosen 60% of the time over BnB (sauces)\r\n- [ ] Might be worth explaining output groups, as this is a pretty big section of the `coinselection.cpp / spend.cpp` codebase and it can be very confusing reading through the code if you don't know what an outputGroup is or what they are solving for\r\n\r\n\r\n### CWallet\r\n\r\n- [ ] re: birthday, you can also force a wallet to rescan the whole chain\r\n- [ ] how do birthdays work with imported wallets? \r\n- [ ] not sure which is the most \"correct\" terminology, but id avoid referencing \"addresses\". perhaps output types, or script types?\r\n- [ ] even better, write a section about how these concepts map to each other w.r.t the wallet (address <-> output type  <-> scripts)\r\n\r\n### Constructing Transactions\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have some notes on how `AvailableCoins` works, ill send them. Yours are _mostly_ correct mod a few nits\r\n- [ ] interestingly, CWallet::mapWallet operates on TXs, not Coins. it first checks of the TX is eligible, then loops through each Output of the tx and adds them to available coins \r\n- [ ] AvailableCoins also takes a coincontrol object and uses it while deciding which coins are available, might be worth mentioning here\r\n\r\n### HWI\r\n\r\nhmu when you get to this section, happy to help/review! I use it in my setup and have also dug into the internals for the 22.0 testing guide\r\n\r\n",

Users can still opt in to adjusted time by setting `-maxtimeadjustment` with a value greater than zero. This allows gaining feedback as to what extent user space depends on adjusted time.\r\n\r\nIf we want to remove the adjusted time code down the road, it makes sense to give users the fallback option to use adjusted time for a release or two. This also reduces our code reversion risk in the case that users rely on it. The release notes would describe the change and suggest that the option is being deprecated for future removal.\r\n\r\nSee #7573 and #4521 for further context.",

As such, we should really support descriptor wallets.\r\n\r\nI suspect it's more than just `dumpprivkey` that was the problem and there may be other RPCs that we'll have to deal with, but `dumpprivkey` was the showstopper at the last release.\r\n\r\nSpecification of \"output script descriptors\": https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0380.mediawiki#key-expressions\r\nUnfortunately `getaddressinfo` does not similarly have a private option, or contain the key afaict.\r\n",

Historically speaking, we've never dropped support for an old wallet format, and how frequently I see reports of people trying to access old wallets, I fear this will worsen it.\r\n\r\n> In light of descriptor wallets not having an upgrade path for non-HD wallets, I don't think legacy wallet support can be reasonably removed.\r\n\r\nWhy specifically do you see that as a problem? You already need regular backups of non-HD wallets anyway, needing a one-time new backup after migration to HD doesn't seem too big of a deal to me. As said above, I do prefer a few more years before forcing people to migrate, but if one accepts that a migration is going to happen, I don't see the problem with restricting it to use HD key derivation. If one is concerned about the specifics of BIP32's unhardened derivation, it should be possible to choose hardened derivation descriptors instead, or by then some other deterministic key derivation mechanism may be supported by descriptors.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "#26596 (draft) allows users to migrate a legacy wallet without the need for BDB. There are some (corruption) scenario's it can't handle. For that users would have to download an old version of Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nRecent versions contain a separate `bitcoin-wallet` binary, which means they don't have to run a potentially outdated Bitcoin Core node just to migrate their wallet. We'd have to make sure that standalone tool is feature complete enough. I don't have much experience with fixing corrupt wallets. See #13044 for things that might be missing (e.g. only available as an bitcoind RPC call or startup argument).\r\n\r\nIn addition we'd need a way to migrate a non-hd legacy wallet (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20160#issuecomment-1244759508). IIUC in particular we need it to _not_ generate a fresh HD seed in that case. And maybe benchmark the performance to see if the use of individual SKPM's is acceptable, and if not, design a new one that can have multiple keys. Such ancient wallets may be a very small number of users, but probably not very small amounts of BTC. It makes sense to make any migration for them as limited as possible (they can create a fresh wallet and move coins over when they feel comfortable). In particular this deprecation should not be a barrier to upgrade their node.\r\n\r\nHaving a read-only BDB wallet (which #26596 enables) could be useful for such users too. It lets them see the coins are still there.\r\n\r\nThat removes any objections I have about dropping BDB from the codebase and dependencies entirely. However, not too soon. We can probably wait until the ancient 2010 code becomes a problem for (using) modern compilers. As long as building from source and running (most of) the test suite doesn't require BDB, it's not a huge burden to keep it around a while longer.",

          "title": "Evaluate sqlite as a replacement for BDB",
          "body": "On #2194, @zooko wrote:\r\n> I am a huge fan of sqlite and would happily give my :+1: to using that. It has a long track record of reliability in many deployments, [their test policy](https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html) is top notch and we could learn from it! I have had extensive — and entirely positive — experience working with sqlite. The developer docs are great.\r\n>\r\n> If anyone wants to argue against sqlite on performance grounds, that's fine, but I'm going to listen to this argument only if you bring a realistic performance test that shows (at least approximately) how many z-addresses/t-addresses/transactions/etc. incur how much of a performance penalty in a realistic scenario. My guess is that sqlite is more than performant enough for most or all practical scenarios.\r\n\r\n@veikkoeeva wrote:\r\n> A vote for SQLite here too, an excellent cross-platform and development friendly choice.\r\n>\r\n> An added note, as this may not be evident, but if ZCash were to adopt the convention that all queries will be explicitly identified and used so that the ZCash \"engine\" would care only that the variable and column names and types remain the same, it would be possible to switch the DB engine or the implementation on the fly. This gives the added benefit one can adapt the structures taking account the hardware and amount of data, for instance, as in sending \"computation and data\" between the engine and the program. Prior art is availabe at https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/src/OrleansSQLUtils, see different scripts (the queries are keyed [like this](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/blob/master/src/OrleansSQLUtils/CreateOrleansTables_SqlServer.sql#L252) and loaded and used by these keys). This way one can make use of the various tooling suites and backends depending on any platform variables. This is, I suppose, mostly like Stackoverflow operates too. As to why this might be important for a running system, maybe [this post mortem](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bharry/2016/02/06/a-bit-more-on-the-feb-3-and-4-incidents/) indicates as to why. As the amount of data grows or there are problems, one could adjust queries on the fly.\r\n>\r\n> On tangential, this would also allow one to transparently to make use features such as at https://www.pipelinedb.com/ (assuming one would switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL) or pipe data through the DB interface to any other storage (e.g. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt143171.aspx) by simply modifying the queries appropriate &ndash; as it would be transparent to ZCash. I.e. making ZCash perhaps more readily integrable to various other systems.\r\n\r\n@radix42 wrote:\r\n> One thing I'd like to make note of is that currently all calls to access either database (LevelDB or Berkeley DB) are very much peculiar to the database in use. I'd recommend first factoring out all calls that result in database access into some nice abstraction layer, starting of course with the current databases that are in use. Then safely swapping out the backend(s) will be a whole lot easier. I bloodied my head against this some months ago when I made the start of a switch to lmdb. It was not pretty because of this.\r\n\r\n@veikkoeeva wrote:\r\n> @radix42 I second that too. Which is, in fact, how the aforementioned _Storage Providers_ in the just linked Orleans work. This is repeating the obvious, but for completeness sake, there's an interface and an implementation class and then a loader the loads the implementation. One backend is ADO(.NET), i.e. \"relational databases\" and that specific backend works as just mentioned.\r\n\r\n@ebfull wrote:\r\n> @nathan-at-least We tentatively believe that sqlite would be a nice replacement for Berkeley DB, and would like you feedback. If we don't hear from you soon, we will assume you agree.\r\n\r\n@zooko wrote:\r\n> [...] there are two different uses of DBs in Zcash — 1. the chain state DB that contains UTXOs, tree states, and stuff like, and 2. the wallet data file. The latter is where we currently use BerkeleyDB, and we definitely want to get rid of it (unreliable, problematic licensing, frequent backward-incompatible releases), and the latter doesn't ([I guess](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2194#issuecomment-288827202)) need better-than-sqlite performance.\r\n>\r\n> I also [agree] with what @veikkoeeva and @radix42 are saying above — we should use an abstraction layer: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2194#issuecomment-289211140, https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2194#issuecomment-289028249\r\n\r\nSee also #1469, which focuses on licensing issues with BDB; and #1694, an example of a user losing funds apparently due to BDB database corruption.",

The original issue also recommends sweeping all value from keys in this category, I think that feature can be discussed in the future as a follow-up.\r\n\r\nThis PR also patches `PKDescriptor` from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22051 where matching public keys were not returned.\r\n\r\nFollow-up PR for the GUI: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/723",

This means you can only execute that rpc if you are executing it from the system where the bitcoin node is running. But it could be that you are sending the rpc request from outside the node. In that case you don't have access to the file system. So it would be handy to allow passing the content of a wallet dump file instead and also allowing dumping the content not in a file but in the rpc result. \r\n\r\nIt might be a good idea to check for other cases where the same is being done. \r\n",
