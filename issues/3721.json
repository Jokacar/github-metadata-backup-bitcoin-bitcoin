          "body": "Sparked by another discussion (#3721), it seemed useful to open an issue on transaction expiration.\n\nIt has been my longstanding contention that transaction lifetimes should be more deterministic. If a transaction does not confirm within a set period, the mempool should forget it, rather than accumulating garbage and leaving the transaction in limbo.\n\nOne proposal bandied about on IRC is to expire any transaction from the memory pool, that does not confirm within X blocks.  Proposed value for X is 2 days, 144*2.\n\nIt is always the responsibility of the client to retransmit a transaction until it is confirmed.  If a client ceases retransmission, and waits X blocks, they have a reasonable chance of presuming the network has forgotten the transaction [assuming the network has mostly upgraded]. That enables the client to recover the dead transaction, including double-spending with a higher fee.\n\nThis seems to accomplish two useful goals:  preventing the mempool from accumulating garbage, and making transaction lifetime more deterministic [within a certain probability].\n\nRelated: mempool superblock redesign (#3723).\n",

So, transactions which are from an external source and don't include an address the wallet currently knows about are added to the mempool and relayed to all connected clients.  When there are no connected clients, won't you end up in the situation described?\n\nAlso, sendrawtransaction does not require wallet, so it could be used with `-disablewallet` making the above apply to all transactions.\n",
