    "title": "Consider making 27.x Long-Term Support (LTS)",
    "body": "As mentioned in the patch notes for 28.x, since this release drops support for glibc older than 2.31, it will not run on several widely used Linux distros, including RHEL 8 and the RHELatives that base off of this, such as AlmaLinux 8 and Rocky Linux 8.\r\n\r\nIn case anyone is unaware, RHEL 8 and its derivatives are still in active support, and will in fact not be EOL until 2029. While I don't have exact install numbers, I would not be surprised if more than half of Bitcoin Core installations that run on dedicated Linux servers will not be able to update to 28.x as a result of this, without first updating to a new OS.\r\n\r\nAs such, while I'm aware that older release branches usually have important updates backported for some time, I feel it would make sense to \"officially\" designate 27.x as a LTS with an extended window of backported updates - maybe not for the full four years and change until these OSes are EOL, but at least for a good part of it. Otherwise, considering the new security disclosure policy, I fear there will be a lot of clients with published exploits still running when 27.x advisories start getting published.",
