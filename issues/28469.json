    "title": "fuzz: Don't spawn threads prior to __AFL_INIT",
    "body": "Spawning threads prior to `__AFL_INIT` is not supported as the afl++ fork server can't clone threads, see [afl++ docs](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/blob/stable/instrumentation/README.persistent_mode.md#3-deferred-initialization).\r\n\r\nWe however have chosen to do this in several of our targets (e.g. process_message, process_messages) and as a result those targets can not be fuzzed using afl++ (resulting in timeouts). Afaict this is only a problem if the spawned threads are also used (e.g. `join`) in the target.\r\n\r\nA potential fix would be to call `initialize` after `__AFL_INIT` but prior to `__AFL_LOOP`, which will however lead to slower fuzzing for all targets.\r\n\r\n(I'm uncertain why oss-fuzz does not report the timeouts to us but that seems like an issue on their end)",
