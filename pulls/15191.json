The need for this manual reset (AFAICT) arises out of the fact that many of these globals are closely related to the block index (hence `::UnloadBlockIndex`), and need to be reset with it.\r\n\r\nI've shot this \"manual reset\" gun at my foot several times while doing the de-globalize chainman work.\r\n\r\nThankfully, now that we have a `BlockManager` class that owns the block index, these globals should be moved under that class so that they can live and die with the block index. These moves, along with making the block index non-heap-based, eliminates:\r\n1. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3585b521392c5b2c855c3ba6dc9b7d2a171b3710 The need to reason about when we need to manually call `::UnloadBlockIndex` (this decision can at times seem almost arbitrary)\r\n2. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f741623c25455c20bff9eb1ddd10a4ac84dc5655 The need to have an `::UnloadBlockIndex` or explicit `~ChainstateManager` at all",
