    "body": "The node is very efficient at not downloading blocks it doesn't care about. E.g. if a peer has headers for a lower proof-of-work branch, we won't fetch the full block. It'll appear as `headers-only` or `valid-headers` in `getchaintips`.\r\n\r\nThis is fine, but if a user is curious about a block, there's no easy way to obtain it.\r\n\r\n1. you can call `invalidateblock` on the current tip and wait for the node to jump to the other branch\r\n2. you can use some other software to obtain the block via p2p and then feed it to the node with `submitblock`\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if you can just fetch it from a peer, if you know they have it. In the most simple implementation, the user has to specify which node to ask. A more fancy version could automatically try all nodes, and perhaps even randomly connect to new peers until it finds the block.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli getblockfrompeer HASH peer_n\r\n```",

          "body": "When we know of a block via a `headers-only` or `valid-headers` chaintip, we attempt to fetch it from one of the other peers (8bedf7c5b4fb949b2c1055d6324a433233aae78f). If we find the block data, we feed it using `submitblock` to the node that first found it (453658118e51dda1624a479e97c98e854366aa01).\r\n\r\nWhen none of our nodes have the block, I initially considered invalidating the active chaintip on a mirror node, and then just wait for some random peer to give that block. Unfortunately we don't have enough control over the node to do that. E.g. when writing a test, I found that the regtest node simply wouldn't bother asking its peers, at least not within the first 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe best approach for finding a block seems to be to just crawl around using the p2p functionality provided by the [bitcoin-ruby gem](https://github.com/lian/bitcoin-ruby) that we already have.\r\n\r\nWe can get a list of potential peers from one of our nodes database (peers.dat).\r\n\r\nTo ask for a block use `getdata` with the block hash. It will reply with a `block` message.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's necessary / polite to call `getblocks` first with the desired header (base of the branch) to see if the node has this block at all. The node will reploy with an `inv` containing a list of blocks. Tracking this idea here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20155\r\n\r\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation\r\n\r\nAnother approach could be to write a `getblockfrompeer` RPC command to Bitcoin Core, which is potentially also useful for anyone interested in inspecting a (stale) block they only have headers for.",
