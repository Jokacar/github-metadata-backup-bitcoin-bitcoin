More specifically it does *not* disallow any configuration that is currently allowed. (Please correct me if you think I'm wrong.)\r\n\r\nI've worked a lot on removing the use of locale-dependent functions and I fail to see how that effort would be in conflict with documenting and asserting the currently made locale assumptions.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding the following are the only possible effective locale combinations before _and_ after this PR:\r\n\r\n| Program        | C locale (`setlocale`) | Global C++ locale (`std::locale`) |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |\r\n| `bitcoind`      | `C` (classic) | `C` (classic) |\r\n| `bitcoin-qt`      | User configured (no assumed locale) | `C` (classic) |\r\n\r\nIs that your understanding as well?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the suggestion is that we might want to change the current locale logic and allow for `bitcoind` to run with a C locale (`setlocale`) or global C++ locale (`std::locale`) other than the classic locale in the future? That sounds _really_ risky. The mere thought of an accidental fork/network split made possible by a locale dependency bug in combination with the fact that we would allow running `bitcoind` which an _effective_ non-classic C or C++ locale (think `zh_CN`!) gives me nightmares :)\r\n\r\nAgain, please correct me if my reasoning is wrong. I could be missing something :)",

Note that `setlocale(LC_ALL, nullptr);` is _not_ equivalent to `setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\");`.\r\n\r\nI claim that `std::to_string(1.23)` _right now_ (prior to this PR) is guaranteed to be `\"1.230000\"` during the entire lifetime of the `bitcoind` process regardless of the user's configuration and/or his/her `LC_ALL` environment variable.\r\n\r\nIf you still don't think that is the case then I kindly ask you to provide a counter-example in the form of a configuration and/or diff. I would love to be proved wrong and walk away with a TIL experience :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFWIW:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSYNOPSIS\r\n       #include <locale.h>\r\n\r\n       char *setlocale(int category, const char *locale);\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n       The setlocale() function is used to set or query the program's current locale.\r\n\r\n       If  locale is not NULL, the program's current locale is modified according\r\n       to the arguments.\r\n\r\n       […]\r\n\r\n       If locale is NULL, the current locale is only queried, not modified.\r\n\r\n       […]\r\n\r\n       On startup of the main program, the portable \"C\" locale is selected as default.\r\n       A program may be made portable to all locales by calling:\r\n\r\n           setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\");\r\n\r\n       after program initialization […]\r\n```\r\n",

Could that be the case?\r\n\r\nAs you probably know the equivalent of `setlocale(LC_ALL, \"C\")` is called automatically in all applications before `main`.\r\n\r\nThus when the execution of `main` begins the C locale and the global C++ locale are both guaranteed to equal to the classic locale (a.k.a. the \"C\" locale).\r\n\r\nWithout any explicit call to `setlocale(LC_*, \"\")` in the code the default \"C\" locale will be in use throughout the process lifetime no matter what the `LC_*` environment variables are set to.\r\n\r\nLet's demonstrate this with a small test program:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include <clocale>\r\n#include <cstdlib>\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <locale>\r\n#include <sstream>\r\n#include <string>\r\n\r\nint main(void)\r\n{\r\n    std::cout << \"C locale at beginning of main: \" << std::string{setlocale(LC_ALL, nullptr)} << \"\\n\";\r\n    std::cout << \"C++ locale at beginning of main: \" << std::locale{}.name() << \"\\n\\n\";\r\n#if OPT_IN_TO_LOCALIZATION_USING_SET_LOCALE\r\n    setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\");\r\n#endif\r\n#if OPT_IN_TO_LOCALIZATION_USING_STD_LOCALE_GLOBAL\r\n    std::locale::global(std::locale(\"\"));\r\n#endif\r\n    std::ostringstream oss;\r\n    oss << 1000000;\r\n    std::cout << \"std::ostringstream oss;

          "body": "Kill the locale dependency bug class by not allowing Qt to mess with `LC_NUMERIC`.\r\n\r\nContext: #18124 (Recommended reading if you are unsure about how C and C++ locales work in C++)\r\n\r\n**Guaranteed locale settings before this PR:**\r\n\r\n| Program        | C locale category `LC_NUMERIC` | Global C++ locale (`std::locale`) |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |\r\n| `bitcoind`      | `C` (classic) | `C` (classic) |\r\n| `bitcoin-qt`      | No guarantee - user-specified  | `C` (classic) |\r\n\r\n**Guaranteed locale settings after this PR:**\r\n\r\n| Program        | C locale category `LC_NUMERIC` | Global C++ locale (`std::locale`) |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |\r\n| `bitcoind`      | `C` (classic) | `C` (classic) |\r\n| `bitcoin-qt`      | `C` (classic)  | `C` (classic) |\r\n\r\n**Background:**\r\n\r\nPerhaps surprisingly Qt runs `setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\")` on initialization. This installs the locale specified by the user's `LC_ALL` (or `LC_*`) environment variable as the new C locale.\r\n\r\nIn contrast `bitcoind` does not opt-in to localization -- no call to `setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\")` (or `std::locale::global(std::locale(\"\"))`) is made and the environment variables `LC_*` are thus ignored.\r\n\r\nThis results in an unfortunate situation where the `bitcoind` is guaranteed to be running with the classic locale (`\"C\"`) whereas the locale of `bitcoin-qt` will vary depending on the user's environment variables.\r\n\r\nAn example: Assuming the environment variable `LC_ALL=de_DE` then the call `std::to_string(1.23)` will return `\"1.230000\"` in `bitcoind` but `\"1,230000\"` in `bitcoin-qt`.\r\n\r\nFrom the [Qt documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcoreapplication.html):\r\n\r\n> \"On Unix/Linux Qt is configured to use the system locale settings by default. This can cause a conflict when using POSIX functions, for instance, when converting between data types such as floats and strings, since the notation may differ between locales. To get around this problem, call the POSIX function `setlocale(LC_NUMERIC,\"C\")` right after initializing `QApplication`, `QGuiApplication` or `QCoreApplication` to reset the locale that is used for number formatting to \"C\"-locale.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nC and C++ locales 101:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include <clocale>\r\n#include <cstdlib>\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <locale>\r\n#include <sstream>\r\n#include <string>\r\n\r\nint main(void)\r\n{\r\n    std::cout << \"C locale at beginning of main: \" << std::string{setlocale(LC_ALL, nullptr)} << \"\\n\";\r\n    std::cout << \"C++ locale at beginning of main: \" << std::locale{}.name() << \"\\n\\n\";\r\n#if OPT_IN_TO_LOCALIZATION_USING_SET_LOCALE\r\n    setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\");\r\n#endif\r\n#if OPT_IN_TO_LOCALIZATION_USING_STD_LOCALE_GLOBAL\r\n    std::locale::global(std::locale(\"\"));\r\n#endif\r\n    std::ostringstream oss;\r\n    oss << 1000000;\r\n    std::cout << \"std::ostringstream oss;

          "body": "This is an implementation of [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518), using primitives in the BIP-330 (see the updated spec [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki)). Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk on the topic is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670).\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I'll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n- save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n- increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n- improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\nObviously looking for review, let's try to start with a high-level concerns, and keep nits for later.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nPlease don't be scared of 8,000 LOC added. 7,000 of them is minisketch added as a subtree.\r\n\r\nP.P.S.\r\nMy experiments of running this code live (slightly outdated) with a script to replicate the experiment: [here1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#issuecomment-599241490) and [here2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#issuecomment-600388543).\r\n",
