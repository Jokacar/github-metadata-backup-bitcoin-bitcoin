One (1/50k chance, multiplied by 50k attempts).\r\n* How often will this happen? Assuming all nodes keep trying to open new connections all the time, then this will happen once per 0.5s:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8837f1ebde0537b0fdfa1353d06ae8e61a259982/src/net.cpp#L1813\r\n* Is one connection per 0.5s DoS? Probably not.\r\n* Note that the above assumption of all nodes trying to open new connections all the time is not correct. Once a node has 8 (is configurable) outbound connections, it will stop opening new connections. So the above 0.5s is maybe a few seconds or even higher in practice.\r\n\r\nThis can be confirmed by observing a node that is listening on port 8333 and whose address is well propagated (has been online for a long time) and seeing how often it receives incoming connections. I have a long-running node but it is listening on non-default port, so I can't confirm that myself.\r\n\r\nDid I oversimplify or get something wrong?",

          "title": "Make AddrMan support multiple ports per IP",
          "body": "For a long part of Bitcoin's history, this codebase has aggressively avoided making automatic connections to anything but nodes running on port 8333. I'd like to propose changing that, and this is a first PR necessary for that.\r\n\r\nThe folklore justification (eventually actually added as a comment to the codebase in #20668) is that this is to prevent the Bitcoin P2P network from being leveraged to perform a DoS attack on other services, if their IP/port would get rumoured. It appears, at least the current network scale - and probably significantly larger - that the impact is very low at best (see calculations by vasild in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/5150#issuecomment-853888909 e.g.). Another possible justification would be a risk that treating different IP:port combinations separately would help perform Eclipse attacks (by an attacker rumouring their own IP with many ports). This concern is (a) no different than what is possible with IPv6 (where large ranges of IP addresses are very cheaply available), and (b) already hopefully sufficiently addressed by addrman's design (which limits access through based selected based on network groups).\r\n\r\nAnd this policy has downsides too; in particular, a fixed port is easy to detect, and a very obvious sign a Bitcoin node is running there.\r\n\r\nOne obstacle in moving away from a default port that is the fact that addrman is currently restricted to a single entry per IP address. If ports are no longer expected to be generally always the default one, we need to deal with the case where conflicting information is relayed. It turns out there is a very natural solution to this: treat (IP,port) combination exactly as we're treating IPs now; this automatically means that the same IP may appear with multiple ports, simply because those would be distinct entries. Given that indexing into addrman's bucket _already_ uses the port number, the only change required is making all addrman lookup be (IP,port) (aka `CService`) based, rather than IP (aka `CNetAddr`) based.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't include any change to the actual outbound connection preference logic, as perhaps that's something that we want to phase in more gradually.",
