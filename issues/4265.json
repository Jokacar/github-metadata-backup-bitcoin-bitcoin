    "body": "I am currently unable to produce a matching 0.9.1 gitian build; I think it is a bug that bitcoin's gitian build does not enforce specific version of packages that are going to affect the deterministic build.\n\nRight now I am doing some scripting experiments to force downgrade to package versions as per the assert files already in repository, once I am finished perhaps I could see how to fit this in existing (or new) gitian-builder features.\n\nI would like to keep this bug open first and foremost to get your feedback but also to be able to close it when we can say that our gitian build contains all the necessary information (including pinned package versions); this may or not may require extra scripts and/or some feature from gitian-build.\n\nSee https://gist.github.com/gdm85/d83f6a61b1e21249a558\n\nNOTE: I cannot out of my head imagine the reason for this inconsistency, so far I can only think of **linux-libc-dev** as a potential culprit and will move on to next step of troubleshooting once I have all packages at same versions\n",

Each project could then host their own APT archives source to support the reproducible build.\n",
