    "body": "Accepting a transaction to the mempool only succeeds if this transaction\r\nisn't already present. This check operating on txid, it prevents new\r\nsubmissions of the transaction with identical non-witness data but\r\nsmaller valid witnesses. Therefore, overall mempool feerate won't improve\r\neven if such higher-feerate mempool candidate is learnt through wtxid-relay.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes mempool and transaction broadcast already-present checks\r\nfrom transaction's txid to its wtxid.\r\n\r\nA new-wtxid submission may still fail due to replacement rules in\r\nfunction of local policy settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n@jnewbery RE: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18044#discussion_r460704950 I think we agree on the \"same txid, different txids\" nonsense, I didn't mean to track multiple witnesses for one txid rather to accept and rebroadcast \"the best mempool candidate known for a given txid\". A script may have alternatives solvable branches and witnesses to spend them might be different in weight thus creating wtxid with divergent feerates. A best known candidate with regards to a txid is defined as a higher-feerate witness (a smaller one) transaction than our current in mempool one, with identical non-witness data.\r\n\r\nYou might submit a txidA:wtxid1 to your local node, and schedule it for initial-broadcast reattempt. Few minutes, latter you announce to your node a higher-feerate txidA:wtxid2, which effectively replace wtxid1. At `ReattemptInitialBroadcast`, only wtxid2 will be rebroadcast if needed, as best known candidate for txidA. According to me, that's where unbroadcast semantic is unclear, to which wtxid the user should expect seeing \"broadcast-reattempt\" property guarantee ?\r\n\r\nGiven our current relay policy default, I concede this is rather a marginal case, beyond illustrating another limit of our mempool replacement rules. In the future, it's likely to worsen as taproot make it far easier to create witnesses with divergent feerates (e.g a 1-of-1 tapscript compared to a 15-of-15 one). In case of concurrent broadcast, the mempool won't necessary learn the best-feerate candidate. That said, IMO, it's worthy to fix because \"txn-already-in-mempool\" isn't accurate anymore in a wtxid-relay context.",

Further, this opens up potential attacks where you can make malleable smaller and smaller witnesses and keep resubmitting to boost feerate or something. I also think it's sufficiently rare that we'd even have smaller valid witnesses to submit, but then if someone starts relying on this behavior we're stuck supporting it forever.\r\n\r\nwhere you might convince me that it's a problem is if Alice and Bob are doing a payjoin or something, and then Bob changes his witness to be an even bigger one and then broadcasts, locking Alice onto a lower fee rate for the transaction.\r\n\r\nBut again, on urgency, these replacement policies are really only relevant once more complex taproot scripts are widely deployed and a change like this can be added to a future release policy easily.",

Add separate fee-checking logic for clients that need to enforce max fee rates, then remove the `absurdFee` logic from ATMP.\r\n\r\nATMP's `nAbsurdFee` argument is used to enforce user-specific behavior (it is not policy since it isn't applied consistently: it is only ever used in RPC and wallet, and set to 0 everywhere else internally). It should be removed from `AcceptToMemoryPool` because (1) validation results/mempool behavior should not be user-specific and (2) enforcing a max fee rate should be the responsibility of the client instead of the mempool.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR does not intend to _remove_ protection from high fees, just re-delegate the responsibility to clients.",

      "body": "> I don't think this is urgent to fix and incentivizes using the mempool as working space for negotiating smaller witnesses, rather than attempting to produce a smaller signature on first broadcast.\r\n\r\nI think the notion of first broadcast doesn't hold when you have multiple-party involved with alternatives spending paths and so potential concurrent broadcasts. Parties can't produce smaller signatures because key distribution across script branches encodes a policy, it can be either Alice or Bob+Caroll+Dave, where Alice has a higher level of privileges. As a practical example you might have pre-signed vault transactions, like https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-April/017793.html\r\n\r\n> Further, this opens up potential attacks where you can make malleable smaller and smaller witnesses and keep resubmitting to boost feerate or something.\r\n\r\nYou're still liable to RBF rules compliance, especially rule 4 on incremental relay fee ?\r\n\r\n> where you might convince me that it's a problem is if Alice and Bob are doing a payjoin or something, and then Bob changes his witness to be an even bigger one and then broadcasts, locking Alice onto a lower fee rate for the transaction.\r\n\r\nAs a first step you should avoid to introduce witness malleability if parties are distrusted, and currently as I mentioned it won't likely propagate due to default mempool settings. But yes if we change it in the future, it would be a limited guardrail for this kind of scenario.\r\n\r\nThere is no urgency to fix, it's more making consistent our relay wtxid-policy with our mempool one.\r\n",

But that would require special RBF rules to handle it and I think it's better to strictly bound to our current RBF rules to make it easier to reason on. We already have the same issue with someone replacing a parent tx with a new txid and advertising again a chain of transaction paying the same outputs. Cheap RBF replacement should be addressed on its own, this PR doesn't pretend to make it better or worse ?\r\n\r\n> Is there any application out there that would expect to use this behavior? \r\n\r\nBeyond preventing abuse for potential coinjoin/payjoin/vaults and easing future usage for taproot branches, as of today there is the practical usage of selecting your best-feerate witness among a set of valid ones. I don't think a lot of users have yet this mental model but I expect this to change with wider adoption of Miniscript.\r\n\r\nUpdated with better comment/logs.

      "body": "Suggest calling this \"updating tx with cheaper witness\" or similar -- \"wtxid-acceptance\" is pretty generic, it's more analogous to \"replace by fee\", except that you're not even replacing anything as far as the txid goes, which is 99% of what matters? I believe the rule is \"txid remains the same but overall weight decreases; so only witness data can change, tx fee rate increases, and no descendants are evicted from the mempool\". (Note the taproot bip raises the possibility of weight being artificially increased in some cases, so the witness data might strictly be larger despite the tx weight decreasing)",

Initially called it \"wtxid-acceptance\" as this is literally what this PR does, evaluating an already-present utxo-spend candidate on wtxid rather than txid. In practice, I agree that txid is what matters, like evaluating descendants limits. Note, for implementation simplicity, it does evict descendants from mempool, we can implement in-place substitution as a follow-up if it feels needed.\r\n\r\nFor the taproot hint, I think that rational holds, as from the miner viewpoint you want to increase feerate per weight unit. I don't think that effective memory-space of these weight units is a burden for miner mempools.",

Or single-input, if by decomposing multiple known witnesses and analyzing witnessScript we're able to compress to a better feerate witness ? \r\n\r\nEither way, I think what your question is raising is a _separation of concerns_ across the bitcoin stack. I don't think that's the job of network mempools to optimize your spends based on a set of witness element you may have broadcasted. This sounds like a new DoS vector and you would need to pay for the CPU time, thus reducing worthiness of operation.\r\n\r\nI think that composing best-feerate witness in function of your solvable scripts paths is better done by a higher tool. Of course, this software may not implement correctly all weight accounting rules, especially post-Taproot, so this PR allows you to verify composed witnesses against your local mempool, assuming you set `incrementalrelayfee=0`.",

I can imagine there could be lots of reasons why behavior like this would not actually take place in practice.\r\n\r\nWhile opening this PR, I thought too it was a theoretical concern, but [reviewing the DLC specs](https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/pull/51#discussion_r467589135) last week, such protocol would be vulnerable to witness weight inflation discussed here. And a honest participant can't rely on RBF as it's easy for a malicious party to attach a high-absolute-fee, low-feerate chain of transactions to its change output \r\n\r\nOf course you can adopt carve-out mechanism and ensure you don't have more than one immediately spendable output by party but this come with far less protocol flexibility and you might loss few blocks between initial broadcast and trigger of your fee-bump.\r\n\r\nI agree that change advocated in this PR won't fix it without further modifications to our RBF policy but it's at least a minimal prerequisite. \r\n\r\nOr do you think we should first have a broader discussion on the mental model that higher protocol designers should adopt with regards to our mempool/relay policy ?",

      "body": "> @JeremyRubin Do you mean cross-inputs, i.e if we learn wtxid_1:(witA, witB) and wtxid_2:(witA', witB') and witA > witA' and witB < witB' we select witA and witB' to compose new wtxid_3 ? Or single-input, if by decomposing multiple known witnesses and analyzing witnessScript we're able to compress to a better feerate witness ?\r\n> \r\n> Either way, I think what your question is raising is a _separation of concerns_ across the bitcoin stack. I don't think that's the job of network mempools to optimize your spends based on a set of witness element you may have broadcasted. This sounds like a new DoS vector and you would need to pay for the CPU time, thus reducing worthiness of operation.\r\n\r\nIt's not optimizing your spends, it's optimizing miner revenue, which is ~the whole point.\r\n\r\nIn terms of DoS the issue that also occurs is that someone can malicious anti-merge your better witness, e.g.,\r\n\r\nI see B which is better for every input then A, and then I cut B's witness with half A's witnesses, then broadcast. Now B is not minrelay increment better  than half B half A, so i get pinned.\r\n",

          "body": "This is a followup to #19339, refining upon the 2xATMP approach. It adds a `GetTransactionFee` utility function which uses `CheckTxInputs` to get a transaction fee.\r\n\r\nIt also updates the Absurd Fee checking (see `BroadcastTransaction` in src/node/transaction.cpp):\r\n* Use `GetTransactionFee` to get the fee. \r\n    - If it fails, dry-run ATMP to return a proper validation result. (`GetTransactionFee` does not take responsibility for filling in `TxValidationState` although it may be modified).\r\n    - If it succeeds, check against `max_tx_fee`. If fee is too high, just return `MAX_FEE_EXCEEDED`.\r\n* If fee is ok, call ATMP to submit to mempool. Broadcast.\r\n\r\nATMP is called at most 1 time. I think it's best to dry-run ATMP in the failure case because ATMP should be the authority on validation, i.e. be responsible for filling in `TxValidationResult` here. If the results don't match; i.e. `GetTransactionFee` fails but ATMP somehow succeeds (which _should_ never happen), we don't risk accidentally allowing an absurd fee through.",

      "body": "@glozow \r\n\r\n> I think at the very least there should be a clearer error for this. AFAIK right now a user would have to guess that the one in mempool has a different witness and then use getrawmempool or getrawtransaction to confirm?\r\n\r\nGood idea, that's maybe better for now to return a new error for an unsuccessful `sendrawtransaction` due to an already-present txid-with-different-wtixd. I'll open separately with the test.\r\n\r\n> In terms of DoSing, it seems to me that this is essentially \"RBF taking into account witness data\" (is that incorrect?) and can thus be evaluated in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nIn the context of multi-party protocol (e.g a CoinSwap, LN), what is concerning is a pinning (https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/transaction-pinning/) where a malicious participant inflate a provided witness to delay a time-locked transaction either for timevalue-DoS or plainly stealing funds due to concurrent claiming. \r\n\r\nBecause for the fix to be effective you need to change the RBF logic from requiring an absolute fee increase between 2 transactions from a feerate relative increase (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/283a73d7eaea2907a6f7f800f529a0d6db53d7a6/src/validation.cpp#L910) . Currently, with a default incrementalrelayfee > 0, this PR isn't not going to mitigate the pinning issue network-wise as the absolute fee is committed as part of the txid and thus is strictly the _same_ between a divergent-wtxids/equivalent-txid transaction pair.\r\n\r\nIt needs more thoughts that the current PR which is more providing locally fee estimation between different witnesses to a user.",

Users submitting through `BroadcastTransaction()` (i.e. `sendrawtransaction` or the wallet) don't get notified that there's a different transaction in the mempool, although it doesn't crash. Users submitting through `testmempoolaccept()` will get a \"txn-already-in-mempool\" error.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply distinguishes between `txn-already-in-mempool` and `txn-same-nonwitness-data-in-mempool`, without handling them differently: `sendrawtransaction` still will not throw, but `testmempoolaccept` will give you a different error.\r\n\r\nI believe the intention of #19645 is to allow full swaps of transactions that have different witnesses but identical nonwitness data. Returning a different error message + adding a test was suggested: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19645#issuecomment-705109193 so this is that PR.",

          "body": "[WIP] This requires #22253 and is built on top of #21800, please review them first.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements deduplication of package transactions that have the same txid as transaction(s) in the mempool. In that sense, our policy changes because it is no longer all-or-nothing. I would still call it \"atomic\" because it either decides (1) all transactions may be submitted to mempool or (2) there should be no change to the mempool. Importantly, we deduplicate by txid rather than wtxid - a transaction with the same nonwitness data should be sufficient to validate the descendants in the package.\r\n\r\nI consider this a prerequisite to _submission_ of packages to mempool, because it would be a rather annoying limitation if we couldn't tell that the package was already partially in the mempool. It could also be problematic if someone could submit the transaction with a different witness to cause the package to be rejected.",

          "title": "[mempool] allow tx replacement by smaller witness",
          "body": "This PR is a reattempt of #19645, which has been abandoned.\r\n\r\nCurrently, an existing mempool transaction can't be replaced by a transaction that's identical except for its witness (same txid, different wtxid); the request is rejected as a duplicate. This PR changes this behavior such that the mempool will replace the existing transaction if the new transaction has a smaller witness by at least 5% (an anti-Dos measure). The replacement transaction can't increase the fee (since its inputs and outputs cannot change), but it necessarily has a higher fee _rate_ than the existing transaction, since its overall size is lower. Miners should always prefer the replacement transaction.\r\n\r\nAn important difference between what this PR implements and the existing RBF (replace-by-fee, BIP125) is that the replacement can occur even if the original transaction is not marked as replaceable. This is because the replacement transaction will pay the same outputs as the transaction being replaced (identical txids ensures this), so the recipients of the existing transaction have no reason to fear not being paid by the replacement transaction. Unlike RBF, all of the existing transaction's descendants, if any, remain in the mempool.\r\n\r\nInitially, we'll limit this to single transactions (not packages); this can be reconsidered later.",
