    "body": "### Issues, reports or feature requests related to the GUI should be opened directly on the GUI repo\n\n- [X] I still think this issue should be opened here\n\n### Report\n\nHello developers,\r\n\r\nI know that you probably think that this is so obvious and basic but it needs to be said. \r\n\r\nWhen a new person wants to run a full BTC node on their computer for the first time can you make it very obvious to that person that the Bitcoin Core program needs to be downloaded and installed onto their \"C\" drive of their computer first.  \r\n\r\nThen that person will have the ability to sync up and store the BTC blockchain to what every drive they intend, whether that be the \"D\" drive of their computer or an external HDD or SSD so that they can carry around the node with them. \r\n\r\nThe problem i had was that i had downloaded and installed the Bitcoin Core program onto an external HDD, then i plugged that external HDD into my laptop thinking that it would just carry on syncing up, it did not because the Bitcoin Core program needs to be already installed on to the C drive of the laptop first, then i would need to point the program as to where it needs to sync up the data to (in this case my external HDD or that I'm not using up all of the space on the laptop). \r\n\r\nThanks !
