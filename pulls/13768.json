The reason that I use macros is that developers might not want to pass second parameter `utf8` everytime when they call `string` or create `path` objects.\r\n\r\nI tried to find all `string` methods and convert them to `u8string` except for external api calls. Also tried to convert explicit or implicit `path` to `u8path`. Tell me if you find something that I missed.\r\n\r\nRequired: bitcoin-core/leveldb#18\r\n\r\nSee #13787 for travis run result\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: The user must change their config file to be utf-8 encoded if the file contains any non-ascii characters in it. Before 0.18, they are read as ansi-encoded characters on Windows.\r\n--",
