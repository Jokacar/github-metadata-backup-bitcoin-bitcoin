    "body": "While auditing the Bitcoin Core RPC code I found an issue in UniValue. `UniValue::read()` in UniValue 1.0.3 and 1.0.4 allows a segfault via high object depth JSON.\r\n\r\nLive demo:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ src/bitcoind -regtest -rpcuser=u -rpcpassword=p > /dev/null &\r\n[1] 8625\r\n$ curl -u u:p --request POST \\\r\n      --data $(python -c 'print(50000 * \"[\");') http://127.0.0.1:18443\r\ncurl: (52) Empty reply from server\r\n[1]+  Segmentation fault      (core dumped) src/bitcoind -regtest -rpcuser=u -rpcpassword=p > /dev/null\r\n```\r\n\r\nI reported the issue to `security@` and UniValue author @jgarzik back in early November 2019.

The issue in UniValue has been assigned CVE-2019-18936.\r\n\r\nWe need to bump our UniValue version to address this issue :)\r\n\r\nCVE details submitted to MITRE by @jgarzik:\r\n\r\n* Suggested description: `UniValue::read()` in UniValue 1.0.3 and 1.0.4 allows a segfault via malformed JSON.\r\n* Additional Information: UniValue is a JSON I/O library commonly used in cryptocurrency applications.\r\n* VulnerabilityType Other: Denial of Service\r\n* Vendor of Product: univalue\r\n* Affected Product Code Base: univalue - 1.0.4, univalue - 1.0.3\r\n* Affected Component: `UniValue::read()` method\r\n* Attack Type: Context-dependent\r\n* Impact Denial of Service: true\r\n* Attack Vectors: Supply malformed JSON into UniValue's JSON parser.\r\n* Reference: https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue\r\n* Has vendor confirmed or acknowledged the vulnerability?: true\r\n* Discoverer: practicalswift\r\n* Reference: https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue/compare/v1.0.4...v1.0.5, https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue/pull/58",

      "body": "@MarcoFalke \r\n\r\n> As far as we are concerned, this is just a stylistic issue. \r\n\r\nIt would be silly for me to try to oversell this relatively small issue, but calling it \"just a stylistic issue\" from a Bitcoin Core perspective does not feel like an accurate description TBH :)\r\n\r\n**Point 1. RPC user whitelisting** \r\n\r\nWith the merge of RPC user whitelisting (PR #12763) we now effectively have \"not-as-trusted-as-the-node-operator\" RPC consumers whether we like it or not. Any such not fully trusted RPC consumer can trivially trigger this UniValue bug as demonstrated by the `curl` example above and shut down the node that he or she has been given supposedly locked down RPC access to.\r\n\r\nI don't think that is behaviour that our users expect.\r\n\r\n**Point 2. Partial control over JSON payload when Bitcoin Core is used as a service backend**\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you're assuming that access to the RPC interface is either full access (full control over the entire JSON payload sent to the node) or no access (no control over the JSON payload).\r\n\r\nFrom a \"`bitcoin-cli` perspective\" it is easy to get the impression that access is always binary and that the node operator is the only person being able to control the JSON payload.\r\n\r\nIn practice the RPC is interface is often used as a backend to various services (such as web interfaces, etc.). By interacting with these services an attacker can influence gain **partial** control over the JSON payload sent to the node.\r\n\r\nThis is a typical Bitcoin Core RPC JSON payload:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"id\" : 1,\r\n   \"params\" : [… some object structure …],\r\n   \"method\" : \"method_to_call\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a typical RPC-used-from-a-web-application the attacker is probably not being able to influence which method to call (`\"method\" : \"method_to_call\"` in the example above), but it is not unreasonable to assume that he/she may be able to influence at least a subset of the object structure that is sent as parameters to the RPC method (`\"params\" : [… some object structure …]`) by legitimate interaction with the service.\r\n\r\nSo while an attacker is likely not be able to change the \"method\" field from say `help` to `stop` it is not unthinkable that he or she might be able to cause some part of the `params` structure to be of excessively high object depth and thus triggering this UniValue issue and shuts down the backend Bitcoin Core node.\r\n\r\nAnd even in the case that such high object depth would be due to lacking validation on the part of the application developer I think the expectation of our users would be that Bitcoin Core should return a parsing error and not die as it currently does :)\r\n\r\nGiven this clarification, can you see why calling this \"just a stylistic issue\" does not feel entirely accurate? :)",

          "title": "Add RPC Whitelist Feature from #12248",
          "body": "Summary\r\n====\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the RPC whitelisting feature requested in #12248. RPC Whitelists help enforce application policies for services being built on top of Bitcoin Core (e.g., your Lightning Node maybe shouldn't be adding new peers). The aim of this PR is not to make it advisable to connect your Bitcoin node to arbitrary services, but to reduce risk and prevent unintended access.\r\n\r\nUsing RPC Whitelists\r\n====\r\nThe way it works is you specify (in your bitcoin.conf) configurations such as\r\n\r\n```\r\nrpcauth=user1:4cc74397d6e9972e5ee7671fd241$11849357f26a5be7809c68a032bc2b16ab5dcf6348ef3ed1cf30dae47b8bcc71\r\nrpcauth=user2:181b4a25317bff60f3749adee7d6bca0$d9c331474f1322975fa170a2ffbcb176ba11644211746b27c1d317f265dd4ada\r\nrpcauth=user3:a6c8a511b53b1edcf69c36984985e$13cfba0e626db19061c9d61fa58e712d0319c11db97ad845fa84517f454f6675\r\nrpcwhitelist=user1:getnetworkinfo\r\nrpcwhitelist=user2:getnetworkinfo,getwalletinfo, getbestblockhash\r\nrpcwhitelistdefault=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow user1 can only call getnetworkinfo, user2 can only call getnetworkinfo or getwalletinfo, while user3 can still call all RPCs. \r\n\r\nIf any rpcwhitelist is set, act as if all users are subject to whitelists unless rpcwhitelistdefault is set to 0. If rpcwhitelistdefault is set to 1 and no rpcwhitelist is set, act as if all users are subject to whitelists.\r\n\r\n\r\nReview Request\r\n=====\r\nIn addition to normal review, would love specific review from someone working on LN (e.g., @ roasbeef) and someone working on an infrastructure team at an exchange (e.g., @ jimpo) to check that this works well with their system.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThe rpc list is spelling sensitive -- whitespace is stripped though. Spelling errors fail towards the RPC call being blocked, which is safer.\r\n\r\nIt was unclear to me if HTTPReq_JSONRPC is the best function to patch this functionality into, or if it would be better to place it in exec or somewhere else.\r\n\r\nIt was also unclear to me if it would be preferred to cache the whitelists on startup or parse them on every RPC as is done with multiUserAuthorized. I opted for the cached approach as I thought it was a bit cleaner.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Work\r\n=====\r\n\r\nIn a future PR, I would like to add an inheritance scheme. This seemed more controversial so I didn't want to include that here. Inheritance semantics are tricky, but it would also make these whitelists easier to read.\r\n\r\nIt also might be good to add a `getrpcwhitelist` command to facilitate permission discovery.\r\n\r\nTests\r\n=====\r\nThanks to @ emilengler for adding tests for this feature. The tests cover all cases except for where `rpcwhitelistdefault=1` is used, given difficulties around testing with the current test framework.\r\n\r\n",

There is no way that this can be used safely which does not involve plaintext credentials being transmitted across the internet, especially since the complete removal of `rpcssl`. If this is desirable, proxying the socket through `nginx` with SSL is a viable alternative that does not require listening publically. \r\n\r\nThe `rpcbind` option should either be restricted to allow for only single definitions of a host, or removed entirely to only permit binding to `localhost` for the management interface.
