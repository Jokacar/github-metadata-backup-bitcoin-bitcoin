I don't know if 5.15.14 fixes something, or if there's another reason why depends works but homebrew doesn't. There's currently no open PR to bump homebrew's version, an earlier attempt was abandoned: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/172934\r\n\r\nI'm not sure when this started happening. E.g. the commit 338bc2cd261ba3daf7fb494f8cb4a534762e292c which introduced cmake has the same issue.\r\n\r\nI though perhaps it's a change in macOS itself. But I also tried on macOS 13.7 Ventura, with Xcode 15.2 which gives me similar errors.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility could be recent homebrew qt change: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commits/master/Formula/q/qt%405.rb\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nTo build `bitcoin-qt`.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nInstall qt@5 via homebrew, 5.15.13 is the latest version.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmake -B build -DBUILD_GUI=ON\r\n```\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nmaster@fc642c33ef28829eda0119a0fe39fd9bc4b84051\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nmacOS 15.0\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
