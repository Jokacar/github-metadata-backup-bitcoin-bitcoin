    "body": "A more detailed proposal can be found here: https://github.com/jamesob/assumeutxo-docs/tree/2019-04-proposal/proposal\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'd like to talk about the desirability of an `assumeutxo` feature, which would allow much faster node bootstrapping in the spirit of `assumevalid`. For those unfamiliar with assumeutxo, here's an informal description from [one of last year's meetings](https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03-07-priorities/):\r\n\r\n> \"Assume UTXO\" is an idea similar to assumevalid. In assumevalid, you have a hash that is hard-coded into the code, and you assume all the blocks in the chain that ends in that hash, that those transactions have valid scripts. This is an optimization for startup to not have to do script checks if you're willing to believe that the developers were able to properly review and validate up to that point. You could do something similar, where you cache the validity of the particular UTXO set, and it's ACKed by developers before updating the code. Anyone can independently recompute that value. There's some nuanced considerations for this [...]. The downside if you fuck up is bigger. In assumevalid, you can trick someone into thinking the block is valid if it wasn't, and assumeutxo you might be able to create coins or something; there are definitely different failure modes. So there're different security implications here. You could use assumeutxo, but you could go back and double check later. But there's nuance about how this should be done or how. You could have nodes that export this value, [and so one attack might be] you could lie to your friend I guess, but that's less scary than other things.\r\n\r\nIn other words, assumeutxo would be a way to initialize a node using a headers chain and a serialized version of the UTXO state which was generated from another node at some block height. A client making use of this UTXO \"snapshot\" would specify a hash and expect the content of the resulting UTXO set to yield this hash after deserialization. \r\n\r\nThis would allow users to bootstrap a usable pruned node & wallet far more quickly from a ~3GB file (at time of writing) rather than waiting for a full initial block download to complete, since we only have to sync blocks between the base of the snapshot and the current network tip.  Needless to say this is at expense of operating under a different trust model (albeit temporarily), though how different this really ends up being from `assumevalid` in effect is worth debate.\r\n\r\nAn implementation of assumeutxo could allow background validation of the loaded UTXO snapshot to happen concurrently with use of the assumed chain, so the trust model is only relaxed for a limited amount of time. Conceptually this is pretty straightforward: you'd have two chainstates maintained simultaneously, one of which is doing an IBD from genesis up to the base of the snapshot and the other (i.e. the assumed chain) just doing tip maintenance and servicing immediate requests for chain data. Once the validation chainstate reaches the height of the snapshot base, it computes a hash of the UTXO set it built and compares it to the snapshot's hash. If it matches, we throw the validation chainstate away and continue to operate on the \"assumed\" (but now fully validated) chain - otherwise we pitch a fit in the logs and GUI, and either revert to the validation chainstate and continue traditional IBD or simply shutdown.\r\n\r\n## Specifying assumeutxo\r\n\r\nThe assumeutxo value/height pairings could be committed in much the [same way that we currently update assumevalid](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15429). Eventually (and this is not a new idea) we could consider using a [rolling UTXO set hash](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-May/014337.html) or some similar technology to commit to the UTXO set hash in each block header, though this of course ends up being a consensus change. This would obviate the need for any hardcoded assumeutxo value since bootstrapping nodes could obtain the headers chain, choose a UTXO set hash value at some height, and then obtain the correspondent UTXO snapshot from their peers on the basis of that hash.\r\n \r\n## Obtaining snapshots\r\n\r\nSnapshots could be obtained from a variety of sources, whether over the peer network or centralized content distribution networks (CDNs). It doesn't really matter since security is contingent on a content hash, though if assumeutxo ends up being something we actually want to support then I'd imagine we would build a means of distribution through the peer network.\r\n\r\n## Steps\r\n\r\nI've already drafted up an implementation of this that excludes any P2P mechanism for distributing snapshots but makes the changes necessary for loading snapshots and doing concurrent background validation. It exposes two new RPC commands, `dumptxoutset` and `loadtxoutset`, to provide a test harness for creating and loading snapshots. Whether or not we'd actually want to commit that RPC interface is something I'd like input on. \r\n\r\nAnother option is to eschew a `loadtxoutset` RPC and use a `-utxosnapshot=<path>` startup parameter.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, supposing we get that far, we'll probably want to think about implementing P2P distribution of snapshots, and then maybe starting thinking about a rolling UTXO set hash for potential inclusion in block headers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\nI'm curious for general opinions on this idea and the concrete implementation steps. If this ends up being desirable for the project, it'll require a lot of refactoring and will probably result in a lengthy succession of incremental PRs (*a la* the process separation effort), though I am of course happy to propose large, cohesive diffs too. :)\r\n\r\nSpecific questions I have are:\r\n\r\n1. Does the assumeutxo trust model differ materially from assumevalid? If so, how? Is it too aggressive a departure from our existing trust model?\r\n1. If we agree this is a feature worth supporting, does the sequence of \"RPC commands -> hardcoded assumeutxo value, optional use, P2P distribution -> UTXO rolling set hash block header commitment\" make sense?",

This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Original change description\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with assumeutxo, here's a brief summary from [the issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15605) (where any conceptual discussion not specific to this implementation should happen):\r\n\r\n> assumeutxo would be a way to initialize a node using a headers chain and a serialized version of the UTXO state which was generated from another node at some block height. A client making use of this UTXO \"snapshot\" would specify a hash and expect the content of the resulting UTXO set to yield this hash after deserialization. \r\n> \r\n> This would allow users to bootstrap a usable pruned node & wallet far more quickly (and with less disk usage) than waiting for a full initial block download to complete, since we only have to sync blocks between the base of the snapshot and the current network tip. Needless to say this is at expense of accepting a different trust model, though how different this really ends up being from `assumevalid` in effect is worth debate.\r\n\r\nIn short, this is an interesting change because it would allow nodes to get up and running within minutes given a ~3GB file (at time of writing) under an almost identical trust model to assumevalid.\r\n\r\nIn this implementation, I add a few RPC commands: `dumptxoutset` creates a UTXO snapshot and writes it to disk, and `loadtxoutset` intakes a snapshot from disk, constructs and activates chainstate based on it, and continues a from-scratch initial block download in the background for the sole purpose of validating the snapshot. Once the snapshot is validated, we throw away the chainstate used for background validation.\r\n\r\nThe assumeutxo procedure as implemented is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A UTXO snapshot is loaded with the `loadtxoutset <path>` RPC command.\r\n1. A new chainstate (`CChainState`) is initialized using `ChainstateManager::ActivateSnapshot()`:\r\n   1. The serialized UTXO data is read in and various sanity checks are performed, e.g. compare expected coin count, recompute the hash and compare it with assumeutxo hash in source code.\r\n   1. We \"fast forward\" `new_chainstate->m_chain` to have a tip at the base of the snapshot (with or without block data). Lacking block data, we fake the `nTx` counts of the constituent `CBlockIndex` entries.\r\n   1. `LoadChainTip()` is called on the new snapshot and it is installed as our active chainstate.\r\n1. The new assumed-valid chainstate is now our active, and so that enters IBD until it is synced to the network's tip. Presumably the snapshot would be taken relatively close to the current tip but far enough away to avoid meaningful reorgs, say 10,000 blocks deep.\r\n1. Once the active chainstate is out of IBD, our old validation chain continues IBD \"in the background\" while the active chainstate services requests from most of the system.\r\n1. Once the background validation chainstate reaches a height equal the base of the snapshot, we take the hash of its UTXO set and ensure it equals the expected hash based on the snapshot. If the hashes are equivalent, we delete the validation chainstate and move on without event; if they aren't, we log loudly and fall back to the validation chainstate (we should probably just shut down).\r\n\r\nThe implicit assumption is that the background validation chain will always be a subset of the assumed-valid snapshot chain while the latter is active. We don't properly handle reorgs that go deeper than the base of the snapshot.\r\n\r\n### Changes (already merged/outdated)\r\n\r\n![chainstate-beforeafter (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/54435797-a16b0780-4707-11e9-89c3-c90b5686804d.png)\r\n \r\nThe crux of this change is in removing any assumptions in the codebase that there is a single chainstate, i.e. any references to global variables `chainActive`, `pcoinsTip`, et al. need to be replaced with functions that return the relevant chainstate data at that moment in time. This change also takes `CChainState` to its logical conclusion by making it more self-contained - any references to globals like `chainActive` are removed with class-local references (`m_chain`).\r\n\r\nA few minor notes on the implementation:\r\n\r\n- When we attempt to load a wallet with a BestBlock locator lower than the base of a snapshot and the snapshot has not yet been validated, we refuse to load the wallet.\r\n\r\n- For additional notes, see [the new assumeutxo docs](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/blob/utxo-dumpload-compressed/doc/assumeutxo.md).",

Parameterizing these functions by a particular CChainState is necessary for the use of multiple chainstates simultaneously (e.g. for asynchronous background validation).\r\n\r\nIn this change, we\r\n- make the CChainState interface public - since other units will start to invoke its methods directly,\r\n- introduce `::ChainstateActive()`, the CChainState equivalent for `::ChainActive()`,\r\n- and move `IsInitialBlockDownload()` and `FlushStateToDisk()` into methods on CChainState.\r\n\r\nIndependent of assumeutxo, these changes better encapsulate chainstate behavior and allow easier use from a testing context.\r\n\r\nThere are more methods that we'll move in the future, but they require other substantial changes (i.e. moving ownership of the `CCoinsView*` hierarchy into CChainState) so we'll save them for future PRs.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nThe first move-only commit is most easily reviewed with `git diff ... --color-moved=dimmed_zebra`. \r\n",

      "body": "I think James's proposal addresses many of the concerns that have been brought up. \r\n\r\nI think its worth noting that the solution to the \"one practical security difference\" in phase 1 or 2, is not resilient in an adversarial environment. This could be solved by having a client ask all of its connections to verify that the UTXO snapshot is correct, and if any one of its connections says the UTXO set isn't correct, the client would then the client would build the UTXO set from scratch. However, it would be easy for an attacker to force many or even most newly connecting clients to build it from scratch - which defeats the purpose of the upgrade (ie scalability). Assumevalid doesn't have this problems since verifying claims about chain validity is much easier than verifying claims about UTXO set validity. Phase 3 solves the problem in a much nicer way. \r\n\r\n> So you couldn't create coins out of thin air with assumevalid.\r\n> assumeutxo does not have those \"belt and suspenders\".\r\n\r\nEven if we allow the user enter a golden UTXO hash, I believe \r\n\r\n> if it comes to Bitcoin Core internals, we should not allow backdoors and footguns. For example allowing users to modify consensus settings on the command line\r\n\r\nI agree. And so does Pieter Wuille: \"[allowing [utxo snapshots] to be configured is even more scary (e.g. some website saying \"speed up your sync, start with this command line flag!\").](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/bt0yb3/hardcoded_utxo_checkpoints_are_an_enormous/eosxsbb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\". If all 3 phases of jamesob's are implemented tho, allowing the user to input a UTXO snapshot would be safe, since the client could efficiently verify the truth of the claim and ignore it if its not true.",

Currently, each CChainState instance has its own mapBlockIndex, a collection of linked block headers, in addition to a few other data structures that are related to maintenance of the block tree but not necessarily to any given chainstate.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid duplicating this data across chainstates, this change moves chainstate-agnostic block metadata (and related behavior) into a class, `BlockManager`. Chainstates are parameterized with a reference to a blockmanager instance and in practice they share the same instance.\r\n\r\nMost of this change is conceptually move-only, though the diff is somewhat muddled. The first commit can be reviewed slightly more easily with `--color-moved=dimmed_zebra`. Admittedly, that commit is pretty unwieldy; I tried to split it up after the fact with `git add --patch`, but that was difficult because of git's inability to split hunks past a certain point. Some of the moves also ended up being obscured when done over separate commits.",

          "body": "This extends the testmempoolaccept rpc to run on a vector of transactions. The idea is to keep the current mempool immutable and only keep track of the differences to the underlying mempool.\r\n\r\nThis is based on the transaction pool layer idea from #13804. Comment from there:\r\n\r\nThis implements a layer around an immutable tx pool. The layer can be seen as a temporary throw-away shell that provides the same interface as `CTxMemPool`. Its primary purpose right now is to be passed into ATMP while testing acceptance of several (potentially depending) transaction and then to be discarded.\r\n\r\nOne use case could be to determine if smart contracts that are set up with multiple txs would be accepted by current consensus and policy rules.\r\n\r\nIn the future it could be extended to support recursive wrapping of layers or a way to commit changes that happened in the layer to the underlying pool or layer. Furthermore, it could be extended to be revivable after changes to the underlying layer happened. (As opposed to be single-use)",

I open this PR\r\neven in light of the previous discussion because (i) flush-without-erase\r\nalmost certainly provides benefit in the case of snapshot activation (especially\r\non spinning disk hardware) and (ii) this diff is fairly small and gives us convenient \r\noptions for more granular cache management without changing existing policy. \r\n\r\nSee also #15218.

Until we allow chainstate creation from UTXO snapshots (next assumeutxo PR?) it's basically unnecessary, but it is a prerequisite for background IBD support.\r\n\r\nChanges are also made to the initialization process to make use of `g_chainman` and thus clear the way for multiple chainstates being loaded on startup.\r\n\r\nOne immediate benefit of this change is that we no longer have the `g_blockman` global, but instead have the ChainstateManager inject a reference of its shared BlockManager into any chainstate it creates.\r\n\r\nAnother immediate benefit is that uses of `ChainActive()` and `ChainstateActive()` are now covered by lock annotations. Because use of `g_chainman` is annotated to require cs_main, these two functions subsequently follow.\r\n\r\nBecause of whitespace changes, this diff looks bigger than it is.

This means that we have to reclaim some of the cache that we've allocated to the original chainstate (per `dbcache=`) to repurpose for the snapshot chainstate.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it makes sense to have different cache allocations depending on which chainstate is more active. While the snapshot chainstate is working to get to the network tip (and the background validation chainstate is idle), it makes sense that the snapshot chainstate should have the majority of cache allocation. And contrariwise once the snapshot has reached network tip, most of the cache should be given to the background validation chainstate.\r\n\r\nThis set of changes (detailed in the commit messages) allows us to dynamically resize the various coins caches. None of the functionality introduced here is used at the moment, but will be in the next AU PR (which introduces `ActivateSnapshot`).\r\n\r\n`ChainstateManager::MaybeRebalanceCaches()` defines the (somewhat normative) cache allocations between the snapshot and background validation chainstates. I'd be interested in feedback if anyone has thoughts on the proportions I've set there.",

This does **not** change the current default behavior of `dumptxoutset`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThanks to the future `assumeutxo` feature (#15605), we now have a `dumptxoutset` RPC (#16899) which can write the whole UTXO set to disk. However, the current format, although compact, is not easily readable by standard tools (e.g. for someone who would like to study the UTXO set). Plus this binary format might change in the future AFAIK.\r\n\r\nProviding power users an easy way to have a human-readable dump of the UTXOs would be a useful feature. We would this way replace [3rd party hackish tools](https://github.com/in3rsha/bitcoin-utxo-dump) [with possible side effects](https://github.com/in3rsha/bitcoin-utxo-dump/issues/12).\r\n\r\nOn my machine (slow SSD):\r\n* dumping the whole original 4GB binary UTXO set takes around 1mn40\r\n* dumping the set in whole ASCII form takes less than 9GB and 3mn30 (ofc file size/time depends on which ASCII data you write to disk; you can select them via the `format` argument).\r\n\r\nThanks!",

          "body": "# Preamble\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core 0.14 introduces  **assumed-valid blocks**, this feature helps increase the speed of the initial blockchain verification process by acknowledging the software that blocks older than the '_hardcoded_' one  are valid so the sofware can skip checking scripts for its ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe actual definition can be read here: \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.14/doc/release-notes.md#introduction-of-assumed-valid-blocks\r\n\r\n### _With my idea, **assumed-valid chain**, I propose a method to speed up dramatically the blockchain syncing and signature verification for a newly created prunned node._\r\n\r\n# How would it work?\r\n\r\nThe process would be as it follows:\r\n- Bob has already a working and fully-synced Bitcoin Node with prunning disabled\r\n- He already knows what the valid chain is, the list of unspent outputs and so on\r\n- Bob wants to set up a prunned node for himself (or for someone else that trusts Bob)\r\n- Bob tells the software (on the new node) to assume that the chain that he already has is valid.\r\n- Bob provides the new node with X latests blocks and the list of unspent outputs.\r\n- The new node can start in prunned mode just by assuming that the chain Bob provides is valid. (Remember, Bob owns the two nodes).\r\n- The new node just has to verify the latest X blocks (the ones provided by Bob) and download the newer ones (from peers) but never its ancestors.\r\n- From this point, the new node is just another prunned node in the network, it has the same blockchain as a ordinary prunned node.\r\n\r\n# Pros\r\n\r\n- Bob can setup a brand new prunned node in few hours, without downloading the whole chain. This can be useful for low end hardware.\r\n\r\n# Cons\r\n\r\n- Bob needs to know the current state of the chain before setting up the new node.\r\n\r\n# More explanation\r\n\r\nA bitcoin node has to download the chain from the first block because it does not know the current state of the blockchain. This feature is for setting up a second node, it assumes that you already know the state of the chain. This is not initially intended for new users.\r\n\r\nWhen the current Bitcoin Core software is stoped and started it already assuming that the chain that has stored is valid and verified, it just checks latest 100 or so blocks, just to be sure, but it not starts to verify from Genesis Block (because it assumes that blocks in hard-drive were validated when they were downloaded). This also happens when you stop and start a prunned node, without having the old blocks it just assume that they are valid (because they were validated once).\r\n\r\nI hope some developer could get interested in my idea and hopefully be discussed.\r\n\r\n",

There are a few moveonyish/refactoring commits to allow for halfway decent unittests.\r\n\r\nBasic structure is included for specifying and checking the assumeutxo hash values used to validate activated snapshots. Initially I had specified a few height/hash pairs for mainnet in this change, but because of the security-critical nature of those parameters, I figured it was better to leave their inclusion to a future PR that includes only that change - my intent being that reviewers will be more likely to verify those parameters firsthand in a dedicated PR.\r\n\r\nAside from that and the snapshot activation logic, there are a few related changes:\r\n\r\n- ~~allow caching the `nChainTx` value in the CCoinsViewDB; this is set during snapshot activation. Because we don't necessarily have access to the full chain at the time of snapshot load, this value is communicated through the snapshot metadata and must be cached within the chainstate to survive restarts.~~\r\n- break out `CreateUTXOSnapshot()` from dumptxoutset. This is essentially a move-only change to allow the reuse of snapshot creation logic from within unittests.\r\n- ...and a few other misc. changes that are solely related to unittests.\r\n\r\nThe move-onlyish commit is most easily reviewed with `--color-moved=zebra`.",

      "body": ">Enlighten us...\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether I've misunderstood this topic either. I'll just try my best.\r\n\r\nThe idea of fraud proofs originated from Satoshi's whitepaper. Satoshi's whitepaper described that although SPV client cannot validate transactions on its own, it may still receive alarms from fully validating nodes, which points them to the position where something invalid appears, so that SPV client can then download & verify the pointed blocks on its own, to avoid blindly following an invalid chain with more PoW.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a transaction spends a spent coin once again, a fraud proof which consists of Merkle proofs of both the original transaction and the double-spending invalid transaction can be sent to SPV clients, then SPV clients can validate such proof without downloading blockchain, so finally SPV clients will know it's an invalid chain which shouldn't be followed.\r\n\r\nWe can see that the fraud proofs were supposed to work just like \"supervision by public opinion\" in real life, and even better, it was supposed to be \"fact-based\" rather than \"opinion-based\", because the fraud proofs were supposed to be succint, and, verifiable without the gigantic blockchain data.\r\n\r\nWith the help of fraud proofs, SPV was supposed to work almostly as secure as a fully validating node.\r\n\r\nHowever, such strategy has a fatal flaw: to generate a fraud proof, the invalid part of the block must be known in first place. If some part of a block can't be downloaded, you can't convince other people that it's impossible to fully download such block, other people must try downloading it on their own to see whether it's truly undownloadable.\r\n\r\nFor example, a normal valid block has its own Merkle tree, where each leaf node is hash of a valid transaction. If you put something which isn't a hash at all (so that it doesn't have any known preimage) into the Merkle tree, then nobody can provide the \"full block data\". Fully validating nodes won't accept such malformed blocks, but SPV clients will still blindly accept Merkle proofs of such malformed blocks. Fully validating nodes can't prove it's malformed either, at best SPV clients still needs to try downloading the specified block on their own, which on the other side becomes a DoS vector that attacker can send false alarms to trick SPV clients into downloading existing (valid) blocks, wasting their bandwidth, so that the goal of lightweight SPV client is destroyed.\r\n\r\nBack to the topic of fully validating node which just skips downloading the gigantic historical blockchain data: as long as you don't validate all blocks before the UTXO snapshot, you won't know whether some similar invalid/malformed things sneaked into those \"unknown\" blocks. You can't hope someone will alert you either, because you won't know whether it's a false alarm. With the default assumevalid situation, although you don't fully verify the contents of historical blocks either, it's still theoretically (it's theoretical for now, because there are cases which need some currently missing additional commitment structure, like: spending never existed UTXOs) possible to generate a fraud proof which contains objectively irrefutable evidence proving some block is violating the consensus rules.",

The bandwidth needed is small, even for lightweight SPV nodes. \r\n\r\n> a DoS vector that attacker can send false alarms to trick SPV clients into downloading existing (valid) blocks, wasting their bandwidth\r\n\r\nThat's true, however there is already a way of dealing with bad behavior from connected nodes: disconnect from them. As long as the network of SPV servers is decentralized and honest nodes compose a significant fraction of those SPV servers, there's a pretty low limit of possible shenanigans. \r\n\r\nFor example, let's say your pool of SPV servers consists of 70% honest nodes, and 30% malicious actors. If your SPV node is connecting to 10 SPV servers, an average of 3 of them will be malicious and can send 3 fake fraud claims that results in 3 (extra) blocks of download. After disconnecting from those 3 jokers, an average of 1 of the 3 new SPV servers they connect to will be malicious, resulting in a 4th extra block download. The last new SPV node would not usually be malicious. That's 4 extra blocks, that hardly destroys the goal of having a lightweight node. \r\n\r\nSo even if you have a massive fraction of malicious nodes, you can't realy troll SPV nodes that hard as long as they're following best practices and disconnecting from nodes that give them bad data. \r\n\r\n> as long as a typical PC with common Internet connection is still able (not \"required\", \"forced\" etc) to fully validate the entire blockchain, skipping downloading the old blocks would be fine\r\n\r\nI think its very important that the Bitcoin community come to a consensus around bounadaries of what we consider \"safe\" as far as resource usage.

      "body": "> Just one rule-breaking transaction could already be catastrophic\r\n\r\nI think I know what you mean, but a rule-breaking transaction that inflates the supply of bitcoin is not relevant to fraud proofs. The rare event I was talking about in a bitcoin with fraud proofs would be where a majority of mining power tried to fork the blockchain in ways that would fool SPV nodes. If fraud proofs were in place, this would not only be incredibly difficult to pull of (as it would be without fraud proofs), but would also be unsuccessful. Without fraud proofs, such a scenario could succeed, and it could be catestrophic. \r\n\r\n> The point was that you can't know whether the alarm you received is a malicious false alarm. \r\n\r\nThat's simply not true. You download the accused block, you validate it, and then you know.\r\n\r\n> Even if you see a block failed to be downloaded, you can't convince others - \"oh, must be a temporary network connectivity issue, maybe you should just try again?\"\r\n\r\nIf a node can't download a block, then its invalid, full stop. You don't accept that a block is valid if you can't download it. Why would you? If someone can't download it, they should be very convinced that its not a valid block until shown otherwise. \r\n\r\n> In the end the alarm is still going to be ignored.\r\n\r\nIf you program the SPV node software to not ignore that, it won't be ignored. It would be a pretty stupid rule to ignore the fact that the data is not available. \r\n",

There are currently hundreds of thousands of historical blocks up till now, if some stranger tell you block XXXXXX can't be downloaded, what can you do? You must try downloading it on your own. Even if you can finally rule out all false alarms, you still have already paid expensive price.\n\nNot accepting a block is also not the same situation to rejecting a block, the later requires **known, clear evidence**. For example, a full node won't accept a valid block either, until it's fully downloaded & verified.\n\nIf you decide to mark a chain (which you haven't fully downloaded it) as invalid simply because you failed to download some blocks of it, probably a temporary network connectivity issue (which can be either unintentional or intentional/malicious) can effectively shut down your full node, which is even worse than being tricked into downloading (almostly) the entire blockchain.",

      "body": "(from IRC)\r\n\r\n> \\<jamesob> Do we ever expect to support an index that actually requires sequential indexing? Jimpo's BaseIndex advertises that it will index sequentially, but at the moment none of the particular indexers require this. Furthermore, we will have BlockConnected events triggering indexing out of order once we start using background chainstates for assumeutxo\r\n\r\nI don't think it affects when you're doing here, but I think of wallets as mini-indexes requiring sequential indexing. Wallets need to  scan blocks in sequential order so the [`IsFromMe`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/10eb000409a284b35b421818a11168adadaad4bd/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L1046) check in `AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe`) will work. Eventually after #15719 I think wallets and indexes should use the same `interfaces::Chain` sync / rescan / block connected / rewind interface and hooks and work more efficiently together",

          "body": "While working around on #24760, trying to move things around and centralize BlockIndex loading from DB for testing, I stumbled upon `m_snapshot_chainstate`, which seems to never be used at any stage in the code at all. I would like to advocate for removing it (which I'm happy to give a shot) because it just complicates things. I guess it's a relic from something in the past (?).\r\n\r\nOr... maybe I'm missing what it's used for?\r\n\r\nFrom my analysis, here's how `m_snapshot_chainstate` can get assigned (excluding tests):\r\n\r\n- With `ChainstateManager::InitializeChainstate()`, but that's only called in `LoadChainstate()` (which is called in `init.cpp`), which keeps the second parameter `std::nullopt`, the default, which means it never gets assigned.\r\n- With `ChainstateManager::ActivateSnapshot()`, which is never called anywhere\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm missing something... I'm not sure. But if it's not used anywhere, I would like to advocate for removing it to make ChainState management monolithic and simple. \r\n\r\nAnd just between us :-) , while I was working with #24760, I saw that with the pointers that switch between states and I was frustrated that I left the whole thing for a week, until I came back now and I'm happy to see that only one ChainState is being used. Simple is better. \r\n\r\nLet me know whether you guys support such a move. I think this is doable in one day I can put a PR for it today or tomorrow.",

      "body": "Regarding bootstrapping a pruned node from a full-node, the way I'd do it is to bitcoin-cli the running node to stop it accepting any more blocks or transactions, copy --reflink=always the block index and chainstate to a new bitcoind instance, bitcoin-cli the running node to resume accepting blocks and transactions, modify the new instance to use new ports, and enable pruning, and run it, wait for it to prune the block index, and then exit, and voila, I have a ready to copy bitcoind instance that I can install elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure it needs to be much more complicated than this, although ideally a way to do it without suspending activity on the main instance would be nice, but hardly worth it given the relatively little downtime the above method causes.",
