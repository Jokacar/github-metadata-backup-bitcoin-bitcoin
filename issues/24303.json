    "title": "The `libbitcoinkernel` Project",
    "body": "**Project Board**: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/18\r\n\r\nThis is the main tracking issue for the `libbitcoinkernel` project.\r\n\r\nThe `libbitcoinkernel` project is a new attempt at extracting out our consensus engine. The `kernel` part of the name highlights one of the key functional differences from `libbitcoinconsensus` and in fact, most libraries: it is a stateful library that can spawn threads, do caching, do I/O, and many other things which one may not normally expect from a library.\r\n\r\nThis statefulness is necessary for `libbitcoinkernel`'s decidedly incremental approach to extracting our consensus engine. This approach favors:\r\n\r\n1. Reusing existing code\r\n   ...which allows us to be continually integrated with Bitcoin Core and benefit from our extensive test suite\r\n2. Incremental decoupling instead of building from scratch\r\n   ...which allows us to avoid having to prematurely optimizing for a \"perfect\" boundary or API (tends to be highly subjective, non-obvious, may lead to unproductive bike-shedding before we've even done anything meaningful)\r\n\r\nI believe that the work of extracting out our consensus engine into a library and making the API ergonomic is likely to be a multi-release project involving multiple contributors. The incremental approach takes this into account, and respects the sheer size of work (both in writing code and getting it through review) that needs to be undertaken.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\nPlease see the Project Board: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/18\r\n\r\n## Project-wide TODOs\r\n\r\n- [x] Remove `blockfilter.cpp` and `index/blockfilterindex.cpp` from `{bitcoin_chainstate,libbitcoinkernel_la}_SOURCES` after merge of #21726\r\n- [x] Place ChainstateManageOpts under `kernel::` namespace: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065#pullrequestreview-993560535\r\n- [ ] Various followups for #25065\r\n  - [ ] Marco's post-merge review comments: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065#pullrequestreview-996614232\r\n  - [ ] Cory's `kernel::Context` cleanup suggestions: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065#discussion_r882182549\r\n- [ ] Ryan's post-merge review comment: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25223#discussion_r898164322\r\n- [ ] Various followups for #25290\r\n  - [ ] Perform gArgs checking in `ApplyArgsManOptions`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290#discussion_r907535652\r\n  - [ ] Perform `CTxMemPool::Options` checking in `CTxMemPool` constructor: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290#discussion_r900272797\r\n  - [x] Change `CalculateMemPoolAncestors` to take in `CTxMemPool::Limits` instead: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290#discussion_r905260891\r\n- [ ] Various followups for #25487\r\n  - [ ] Improve `DumpMempool`'s mutex: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r916228022\r\n  - [ ] Change `LoadMempool`'s semantics: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r916044902\r\n  - [ ] Make LoadMempool less foot-gunny: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r921234107, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487/commits/c4249c1243981f42091950d1295c2be6bd4bf118\r\n\r\n## The Game Plan\r\n\r\n### Stage 1: Extracting out a usable `libbitcoinkernel.{so,dylib,dll}`\r\n\r\n#### Step 1: Introduce internal `bitcoin-chainstate` and `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. What `.cpp` files do we need?\r\n\r\nThis `bitcoin-chainstate` executable uses our consensus engine and its build system code will reveal the minimal set of files we need to link in to use our consensus engine as-is. It is important to note that this list of files will serve as a guiding \"North Star\" for this first stage of the plan: as we decouple more and more modules of the codebase from our consensus engine, this list will grow shorter and shorter.\r\n\r\nThis list of files (the `_SOURCES` in `Automake` speak) then serves as the basis for a `libbitcoinkernel`, which `bitcoin-chainstate` will be linked against.\r\n\r\n**Key Result:** Any further coupling of our consensus engine with non-consensus modules will result in linker errors, preventing this project from becoming a sisyphean task of battling coupling regressions.\r\n\r\n#### Step 2: Decouple most non-consensus code from `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. Prune the unnecessary `.cpp` files!\r\n\r\nThere are many modules which do not logically belong in `libbitcoinkernel` (e.g. `index/*.cpp`, `netaddress.cpp`), but are nevertheless necessary to be included in its `_SOURCES` for `bitcoin-chainstate` to link correctly. This is because Bitcoin Core's existing codebase is full of unnecessary dependencies/couplings that need to be untangled/decoupled/broken up.\r\n\r\nThis step is where we do the decoupling for:\r\n1. `netaddress.cpp`\r\n2. Parts of `timedata.cpp`\r\n3. Parts of `init/common.cpp`\r\n4. `ArgsManager` (this one's a doozy)\r\n5. `index/*.cpp`\r\n6. `shutdown.cpp`\r\n7. `logging.cpp`\r\n\r\n**Developer Note:** We do not decouple the mempool *yet* because most users of `libbitcoinkernel` may want to have an embedded mempool with Bitcoin Core's policies and we can decouple it later.\r\n\r\n#### Step 3: Introduce an external `bitcoin-chainstate`\r\n##### a.k.a. What `.h` files do we need?\r\n\r\nBefore this step, `bitcoin-chainstate` has been an internal executable managed by our build system with access to all files and headers. In this step, we add an external `bitcoin-chainstate` with a separate build system to reveal the minimal set of headers we need to ship in order to make the `libbitcoinkernel` library usable.\r\n\r\n#### Step 4: Decouple most non-consensus headers from `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. Prune the unnecessary `.h` files!\r\n\r\nSimilar to Step 2, there are lots of small decoupling of the header dependency tree here. A notable piece of this step is to remove `leveldb` includes from our headers to avoid needing to re-ship `leveldb` headers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stage 2: Polishing the API / Continual De-coupling\r\n\r\nAt this point, we have a usable `libbitcoinkernel` that is _somewhat_ minimally linked. However, it has a very idiosyncratic, Bitcoin Core-specific C++ interface. The goal of this stage is to incrementally make the `libbitcoinkernel` API more ergonomic for users outside of Bitcoin Core. Bindings to other languages (first C, then others) should be introduced.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have near-zero experience with library API design and langauge bindings, so I think ***it would be wise for other contributors to lead this stage***. Ideally, they would be able to work with users looking to integrate with `libbitcoinkernel` who can give an accurate account of the API ergonomics from the library user's point of view. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting `libbitcoinkernel` Through Review\r\n\r\nMost of the changes to be made are \"move only\", but there are a lot of these \"move only\" changes to be made. Of course comments/reviews regarding correctness are always more than welcome, but I want very much to avoid losing momentum on this project because of style or style-adjacent comments/reviews.\r\n\r\nI propose the following ground rules to make this process more streamlined for all parties involved and a few things that I can do to help:\r\n\r\n1. Any outstanding comments/reviews not pertinent to the main thrust of PRs should not delay/block the merging of the core functionality of PRs. I will make sure to open a separate issue tracking all the leftover comments/reviews so that they won't be missed and can be addressed one by one.\r\n2. Whenever the PR reaches a stage where there are only leftover comments/reviews left, I will make a comment saying so. This might make it easier for maintainers to determine roughly where the PR is at in its lifecycle (ofc don't trust me, verify :smile:).\r\n\r\n## Action Items\r\n\r\n1. If you have any questions, please post them below!\r\n2. If you plan on reviewing `libbitcoinkernel` or are a maintainer:\r\n    1. Please make sure you've read the \"Getting `libbitcoinkernel` Through Review\" section above.\r\n    2. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help streamline the review process.\r\n3. If you would like to take the lead on \"Stage 2: Polishing the API / Continual De-coupling\", please leave a comment below, I'd love to talk!",

They should be able to depend on other symbols in other libraries, but no other libraries should depend on symbols in them (and they shouldn't depend on each other).\r\n\r\n- `libbitcoin_consensus.a` should be a standalone library that doesn't depend on symbols in other libraries mentioned here\r\n\r\n- `libbitcoin_common.a` and `libbitcoin_util.a` seem very interchangeable right now and mutually depend on each other. I think we should either merge them into one library, or create a new top-level `src/common/` directory complementing `src/util/`, and start to distinguish general purpose utility code (like argument parsing) from bitcoin-specific utility code (like formatting bip32 paths and using ChainParams). Both these libraries can be depended on by `libbitcoin_server.a`, `libbitcoin_wallet.a`, and `libbitcoinqt.a`, and they can depend on `libbitcoin_consensus.a`. If we want to split util and common up, as opposed to merging them together, then util shouldn't depend on libconsensus, but common should.\r\n\r\nOver time, I think it'd be nice if source code organization reflected library organization . I think it'd be nice if all `libbitcoin_util` source files lived in `src/util`, all `libbitcoin_consensus.a` source files lived in `src/consensus`, and all `libbitcoin_server.a` code lived in `src/node` (and maybe the library was called `libbitcoin_node.a`).\r\n",

      "body": "@JeremyRubin \r\n> I guess what I mean is it would be good to have a more clear cut boundary for libbitcoinkernel both up the stack on API boundaries...\r\n\r\nRight, I think we leave the API boundary up the stack until stage 2, so that we \"avoid having to prematurely optimizing for a \"perfect\" boundary or API (tends to be highly subjective, non-obvious, may lead to unproductive bike-shedding before we've even done anything meaningful)\"\r\n\r\n> but also \"down the stack\" in terms of what libbitcoinkernel can provide v.s. what the host environment should. Maybe this is a malformed question, feel free to chat me and we can flesh out if it's meaningful.\r\n\r\nAh I see, yeah I think the libbitcoinkernel case is very different from the libbitcoinconsensus case, since \"it is a stateful library that can spawn threads, do caching, do I/O, and many other things which one may not normally expect from a library\". Right now if you build #24304 with `--enable-shared --enable-experimental-util-chainstate` you will find that the library relies on only the \"expect\" set of runtime libraries:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ldd ./src/.libs/libbitcoinkernel.so\r\n        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc387c6000)\r\n        libpthread.so.0 => /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007faaecf6c000)\r\n        libstdc++.so.6 => /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007faaecd56000)\r\n        libm.so.6 => /usr/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007faaecc12000)\r\n        libgcc_s.so.1 => /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007faaecbf7000)\r\n        libc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007faaeca2b000)\r\n        /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007faaedc83000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, a good decision to ponder upon is whether or not we should be embedding libraries such as `leveldb`, `crc32c`, and `boost` or whether we should require them as a runtime dependency.

      "body": "@ryanofsky \r\n\r\n> I don't understand why there isn't a clearer answer about what's in the kernel and what's not in the kernel. \r\n\r\nWhat's included in `libbitcoinknernel` will always be \"everything that is required for the consensus engine to function\".\r\n\r\nAs of #24322, we're only capturing the dependencies **as they are right now**, which unfortunately includes things like `index/*.cpp`, `netaddress.cpp`, etc.\r\n\r\nThroughout stage 1, we will decouple (or in some cases, abstract away) these unnecessary modules from the consensus engine, which will allow us to remove them from `libbitcoinkernel`.\r\n\r\nRight now in my exploration branch, here is the list of files that are still necessary to be linked in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibbitcoinkernel_la_SOURCES = \\\r\n  arith_uint256.cpp \\\r\n  chain.cpp \\\r\n  kernel/chainparamsbase.cpp \\\r\n  chainparams.cpp \\\r\n  clientversion.cpp \\\r\n  coins.cpp \\\r\n  compat/glibcxx_sanity.cpp \\\r\n  compressor.cpp \\\r\n  consensus/merkle.cpp \\\r\n  consensus/tx_check.cpp \\\r\n  consensus/tx_verify.cpp \\\r\n  core_read.cpp \\\r\n  dbwrapper.cpp \\\r\n  deploymentinfo.cpp \\\r\n  deploymentstatus.cpp \\\r\n  flatfile.cpp \\\r\n  fs.cpp \\\r\n  hash.cpp \\\r\n  kernel/init/common.cpp \\\r\n  key.cpp \\\r\n  kernel/logging.cpp \\\r\n  node/blockstorage.cpp \\\r\n  node/chainstate.cpp \\\r\n  kernel/node/coinstats.cpp \\\r\n  node/ui_interface.cpp \\\r\n  policy/feerate.cpp \\\r\n  policy/fees.cpp \\\r\n  policy/packages.cpp \\\r\n  policy/policy.cpp \\\r\n  policy/rbf.cpp \\\r\n  policy/settings.cpp \\\r\n  pow.cpp \\\r\n  primitives/block.cpp \\\r\n  primitives/transaction.cpp \\\r\n  pubkey.cpp \\\r\n  random.cpp \\\r\n  randomenv.cpp \\\r\n  scheduler.cpp \\\r\n  script/interpreter.cpp \\\r\n  script/script.cpp \\\r\n  script/script_error.cpp \\\r\n  script/sigcache.cpp \\\r\n  script/standard.cpp \\\r\n  kernel/shutdown.cpp \\\r\n  signet.cpp \\\r\n  support/cleanse.cpp \\\r\n  support/lockedpool.cpp \\\r\n  sync.cpp \\\r\n  kernel/timedata.cpp \\\r\n  txdb.cpp \\\r\n  txmempool.cpp \\\r\n  uint256.cpp \\\r\n  util/bytevectorhash.cpp \\\r\n  util/getuniquepath.cpp \\\r\n  util/hasher.cpp \\\r\n  util/moneystr.cpp \\\r\n  util/rbf.cpp \\\r\n  util/serfloat.cpp \\\r\n  util/settings.cpp \\\r\n  util/strencodings.cpp \\\r\n  util/syscall_sandbox.cpp \\\r\n  util/system.cpp \\\r\n  util/thread.cpp \\\r\n  util/threadnames.cpp \\\r\n  util/time.cpp \\\r\n  validation.cpp \\\r\n  validationinterface.cpp \\\r\n  versionbits.cpp \\\r\n  warnings.cpp\r\n```\r\n\r\nA few modules that we decouple/abstract from:\r\n\r\n1. `netaddress.cpp`\r\n2. Parts of `timedata.cpp`\r\n3. Parts of `init/common.cpp`\r\n4. `ArgsManager` (this one's a doozy)\r\n5. `index/*.cpp`\r\n6. `shutdown.cpp`\r\n7. `logging.cpp`\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course this is still not minimal, but we can make progress on the decoupling a step at a time, and each step is worthwhile because it prevents future re-coupling.\r\n\r\n> If there isn't a clear line that can be drawn, I think it would be best to just treat libbitcoin_kernel as an evolving whitelist of API's that can be called externally, and not move a lot of code around or significantly change source code organization.\r\n\r\nDo you mean that instead of (say) splitting off the consensus-used parts of `init/common.cpp` to `kernel/init/common.cpp`, we just explicitly mark their visibility as default or something?\r\n\r\nI can totally see how that would work, however, I think there's a lot to be gained from a clean split: the functions not existing at all in `libbitcoinkernel` instead of being hidden.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'd love to avoid significant source code organization changes if I can achieve the same goals, and I know you've thought a lot about it, so let's talk more!\r\n\r\n> Otherwise, I would like to know more know more about the statement 'Most of the changes to be made are \"move only\"' because it is not clear to me what code would be moving or where it would be moving to.\r\n\r\nOh of course! Here's an example: https://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/commit/d7cf3f0fc2af24e6d3d38513fb01c2b9d9d48105\r\n\r\nIn the first commit there, we split the parts of `timedata.cpp` not dependent on `netaddress.cpp` and `asmap.cpp` into `kernel/timedata.cpp`, which is \"move-only\" and allows us to eliminate `netaddress.cpp` and `asmap.cpp` from our `_SOURCES`.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's a strictly better/easier to do this that I'm missing!",

Although not absolutely necessary at this step (but eventually necessary in stage 1 step 3 of #24303 ([text fragment link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303#:~:text=Step%203%3A%20Introduce%20an%20external%20bitcoin%2Dchainstate)), we also split off the corresponding declarations off to `kernel/timedata.h`, and adjust existing dependencies on `timedata.h` to `kernel/timedata.h` wherever appropriate.\r\n- Similarly splits off `libbitcoinkernel`-used parts of `init/common.cpp` (namely `init::SetGlobals()` and `init::UnsetGlobals()`) off to `kernel/init/common.cpp`. Meaning that the rest of `init/common.cpp` (which deals mostly with setting up the logger, which we abstract away in a future PR) will not be linked into `libbitcoinkernel`.\r\n\r\n**Note for `libbitcoinkernel` reviewers**: Changes like these are representative of the changes being done in stage 1 step 2 of #24303 ([text fragment link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303#:~:text=Step%202%3A%20Decouple%20most%20non%2Dconsensus%20code%20from%20libbitcoinkernel))\r\n\r\nPlease read the commit messages for more details.",

      "body": "Thanks for posting #24332. Is #24332 your \"exploration branch\" or is that available somewhere else? A lot of things just seem vague to me and I think it would be useful to be concrete.\r\n\r\nIn general, the approach here seems a little different than I what would expect. I would expect most of the work of making the \"consensus engine\" usable as the library to involve getting rid of globals more than moving code around. Like I'd expect step one to be introducing some kind of context for the consensus code to be able to function. Something like a `src/kernel/context.h` file with a struct like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nnamespace kernel {\r\nstruct Context {\r\n  std::function<void(const std::string&)> log_fn;\r\n  std::function<std::string(const char*)> translate_fn;\r\n  std::optional<int64_t> adjusted_time;\r\n  std::unique_ptr<RNGState> rng_state;\r\n  Consensus::Params params;\r\n  std::unique_ptr<ChainstateManager> chainman;\r\n  std::unique_ptr<CTxMemPool> mempool;\r\n  ...\r\n};\r\n} // namespace kernel\r\n```\r\n\r\nmeant to replace globals. Getting rid of globals would let you use the kernel library to write a application simulating multiple nodes. Or let you use the library to write an application that uses consensus functionality for something else, and still has unit tests that run in parallel (not forced to run serially because the kernel library has shared global state.)\r\n\r\nMoving code around and changing source code organization could be related to this, but doesn't have to be. I do think if you do want to change source code organization, you should have a clear idea of how the source code should be organized. Right now we already have:\r\n\r\n- `src/node/` and `libbitcoin_node.a`\r\n- `src/consensus/` and `libbitcoin_consensus.a`\r\n\r\nAnd you are proposing to add:\r\n\r\n- `src/kernel/` and `libbitcoin_kernel.a`\r\n\r\nThe current split between _node_ and _consensus_ makes sense to me. _Node_ is for code we consider internal and unstable and don't want to be reused externally. _Consensus_ is for code that is stable and we think is useful to expose. But maybe we should rename _node_ to _kernel_ or rename _consensus_ to _kernel_? Or maybe we should actually go ahead and keep _node_ and _consensus_ and add _kernel_ as a third middle layer. This could make sense if there is a clear idea of what belongs in this middle layer. Right now the kernel library sounds like a \"consensus engine\" or \"consensus support\" library for things that somehow have to do with consensus, but aren't in _consensus_ library.\r\n\r\nThe idea of excluding anything in the _consensus_ library that uses threads does not seem very tenable to me, when a lot of performant code people will want to write is likely to involve parallelization. It might make more sense if the dividing line had something to do with persistent storage. Like maybe `libbitcoin_consensus` would define abstract _mempool_ and _UTXO database_ interfaces, and `libbitcoin_kernel` would provide a `boost::multi_index` implementation of the _mempool_ interface, and a `leveldb` implementation of the _UTXO database_ interface.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303#issuecomment-1038359187\r\n> > I don't understand why there isn't a clearer answer about what's in the kernel and what's not in the kernel.\r\n> \r\n> What's included in `libbitcoinknernel` will always be \"everything that is required for the consensus engine to function\".\r\n\r\nThis doesn't really answer the question, just turns it into \"what things are in the consensus engine?\" or \"why isn't `libbitcoin_consensus.a` the consensus engine?\r\n\r\n> As of #24322, we're only capturing the dependencies **as they are right now**, which unfortunately includes things like `index/*.cpp`, `netaddress.cpp`, etc.\r\n> \r\n> Throughout stage 1, we will decouple (or in some cases, abstract away) these unnecessary modules from the consensus engine, which will allow us to remove them from `libbitcoinkernel`.\r\n> \r\n> Right now in my exploration branch, here is the list of files that are still necessary to be linked in:\r\n>\r\n> ...\r\n>\r\n> A few modules that we decouple/abstract from:\r\n>\r\n> ...\r\n\r\nThis all seems good, but probably the list of things to decouple should be almost as long as the original list, and there should be not very much code to move to `src/kernel/` if we are keeping `src/node/` and `src/consensus/`.\r\n\r\n> Do you mean that instead of (say) splitting off the consensus-used parts of `init/common.cpp` to `kernel/init/common.cpp`, we just explicitly mark their visibility as default or something?\r\n\r\nRight, everything's already public.\r\n\r\n> Oh of course! Here's an example: [dongcarl@d7cf3f0](https://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/commit/d7cf3f0fc2af24e6d3d38513fb01c2b9d9d48105)\r\n> \r\n> In the first commit there, we split the parts of `timedata.cpp` not dependent on `netaddress.cpp` and `asmap.cpp` into `kernel/timedata.cpp`, which is \"move-only\" and allows us to eliminate `netaddress.cpp` and `asmap.cpp` from our `_SOURCES`.\r\n> \r\n> Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's a strictly better/easier to do this that I'm missing!\r\n\r\nCan you help me understand why this is an improvement? It seems like there could be benefits for understanding and testing and code reuse getting rid of the `g_timeoffset_mutex` and `nTimeOffset` globals and moving them into a context. But this PR just seems to be moving code from one location to another for some benefit I am unable to discern. Maybe there is some insight about the build system I'm missing, but the logic behind having:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/kernel/timedata.cpp\r\nsrc/kernel/timedata.h\r\nsrc/timedata.cpp\r\nsrc/timedata.h\r\n```\r\n\r\neludes me and I think I don't know what the end state is.",

I think it is important to create a context struct, because without one new code is forced to use global variables, and it is harder to get rid of globals gradualy without big blunt instrument changes. The libbitcoinkernel branch https://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/commits/2022-01-v8-on-new-kirby makes reasonable choices about what to deglobalize and what not to (ArgsManager yes, LogInstance no), but in places where it's easy to add channels to avoid referencing globals more places I do think we should do that.",

The `kernel` part of the name highlights one of the key functional differences from `libbitcoinconsensus` and in fact, most libraries: it is a stateful library that can spawn threads, do caching, do I/O, and many other things which one may not normally expect from a library.\r\n\r\nHave you considered naming it something like \"libbitcoin-chainstate\" (matching the new executable name)? \"kernel\", \"util\", \"common\" and \"node\" are all very generic names; would be nice to be more specific if it's at all possible.\r\n\r\nHaving the library focus on managing chain state seems plausible to me: it's distinct from \"node\" which also encompasses mining and p2p and rpc access, and distinct from the current libconsensus which doesn't keep state. To me it would make sense for \"chain state\" to include raw block storage, utxo info for the current tip, the mempool (transactions validated against the current chain state), and perhaps indexes (coinstats, txindex) since they also track the chain...",

          "body": "Part of: #24303\r\nDepends on: #24322\r\n\r\nThe `GetUTXOStats` function has 2 codepaths:\r\n  - One which queries the `CoinStatsIndex` for the UTXO hash\r\n  - One which actually performs the hashing\r\n\r\nFor `libbitcoinkernel`, the only place where we call `GetUTXOStats` is in `PopulateAndValidateSnapshots`, which uses the `SHA256D` hash, and is therefore unable to use the `CoinStatsIndex` since that only provides `MuHash` hashes. Not that I think indices necessarily belong in `libbitcoinkernel` anyway.\r\n\r\nThis PR separates these 2 aforementioned codepaths of `GetUTXOStats`, uses the hashing codepath in `PopulateAndValidateSnapshots`, and removes the need to link in `index/coinstatsindex.cpp` and `node/coinstats.cpp`.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nLogistically, this PR:\r\n- Extracts out the `index_requested` and `hash_type` members of `CoinStats`, which served as \"in-params\" to `GetUTXOStats` embedded within the `CoinStats` struct. This allows `CoinStats` to only consist of \"out-param\" members, and be returned by `GetUTXOStats` without needing to be an \"in-out\" param\r\n- Introduce the purely virtual `UTXOHashers` class, with 3 implementations: `SHA256DHasher`, `MuHashHasher`, and `NullHasher`. These replace the existing template-based polymorphism.\r\n- Split `GetUTXOStats` into:\r\n    - `CalculateUTXOStatsWithHasher(UTXOHasher&, ...)`, and\r\n    - `LookupUTXOStatsWithIndex(CoinStatsIndex&, ...)`\r\n- Use `CalculateUTXOStatsWithHasher` directly where appropriate (`src/validation.cpp` and `src/fuzz`)\r\n- Move `GetUTXOStats` to `rpc/blockchain`, which is the only place that depends on `GetUTXOStats`'s weird fallback behaviour\r\n- Move `LookupUTXOStatsWithIndex` to `index/coinstatsindex`\r\n\r\nCode organization:\r\n- `src/`\r\n  - `kernel/` → only contains the hashing codepath\r\n    - `coinstats.cpp` → hashing codepath implementations\r\n    - `coinstats.h` → header for `kernel/coinstats.cpp`\r\n  - `index/` → only contains the index codepath\r\n    - `coinstatsindex.cpp` → index codepath implementations\r\n    - `coinstatsindex.h`\r\n  - `validation.cpp` → only uses the hashing codepath\r\n  - `rpc/blockchain.cpp` → uses both the hashing and index codepath, old `GetUTXOStats` fallback logic moved here as static\r\n  - `test/fuzz/coins_view.cpp` → only uses the hashing codepath\r\n\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n- [x] Commit messages could be fleshed out more\r\n\r\nWould love any feedback!",

      "body": "Concept/approach ACK\r\n\r\n> Personally, I have near-zero experience with library API design and langauge bindings, so I think it would be wise for other contributors to lead this stage. Ideally, they would be able to work with users looking to integrate with libbitcoinkernel who can give an accurate account of the API ergonomics from the library user's point of view.\r\n\r\nOnce we have a mature `libbitcoinkernel`, I can see two types of new Bitcoin applications leveraging the possibilities of a consensus engine, potentially not requiring as much work than yet-another full-node implementation :\r\na) \"hybrid clients\", a node running as a resources-optimized lightclient in normal time, fallbacking to block validation in case of long-fork detection or any other network anomalies since the last hardcoded assume-utxo\r\nb) \"validating second-layer signer\", a signer module releasing transactions signatures in reaction to a chain height or confirmed counterparties transactions, only if the events happen on the most-work valid chain. The consensus engine would run on the trusted zone of the embedded device. [0]\r\n\r\nIf there is interest to develop those applications, they might be sources of feedback to a `libbitcoinkernel` API, at a velocity faster than a full-node. Also for b), it might be a good use-case to also abstract the raw block storage and utxo info to generic interface as they likely won't fit for embedded resources.\r\n\r\n> and perhaps indexes (coinstats, txindex) since they also track the chain\r\n\r\nI think indexes are more server oriented features than validation. A full-node implementation embedding `libbitcoinkernel` do not need them to stay in consensus with a Bitcoin Core node... Of course, it could be argued that's the same with the mempool, though in practice lack of performance benefits brought to you by transaction validation caching might prevent you to stay _effectively_ at chain tip.\r\n\r\n[0] https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer",

          "title": "[kernel 2d/n] Reduce CTxMemPool constructor call sites",
          "body": "This is part of the `libbitcoinkernel` project: #24303, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/18\r\n\r\nThis PR reduces the number of call sites where we explicitly construct CTxMemPool. This is done in preparation for later PRs which decouple the mempool module from `ArgsManager`, eventually all of libbitcoinkernel will be decoupled from `ArgsManager`.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n- Allows us to have less code churn as we modify `CTxMemPool`'s constructor in later PRs\r\n- In many cases, we can make use of existing `CTxMemPool` instances, getting rid of extraneous constructions\r\n- In other cases, we construct a `ChainTestingSetup` and use the `CTxMemPool` there, so that we can rely on the logic in `setup_common` to set things up correctly\r\n\r\n## Notes for Reviewers\r\n\r\n### A note on using existing mempools\r\n\r\nWhen evaluating whether or not it's appropriate to use an existing mempool in a `*TestingSetup` struct, the key is to make sure that the mempool has the same lifetime as the `*TestingSetup` struct.\r\n\r\nExample 1: In [`src/fuzz/tx_pool.cpp`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b4f686952a60bbadc7ed2250651d0d6af0959f4d/src/test/fuzz/tx_pool.cpp), the `TestingSetup` is initialized in `initialize_tx_pool` and lives as a static global, while the `CTxMemPool` is in the `tx_pool_standard` fuzz target, meaning that each time the `tx_pool_standard` fuzz target gets run, a new `CTxMemPool` is created. If we were to use the static global `TestingSetup`'s CTxMemPool we might run into problems since its `CTxMemPool` will carry state between subsequent runs. This is why we don't modify `src/fuzz/tx_pool.cpp` in this PR.\r\n\r\nExample 2: In [`src/bench/mempool_eviction.cpp`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b4f686952a60bbadc7ed2250651d0d6af0959f4d/src/bench/mempool_eviction.cpp), we see that the `TestingSetup` is in the same scope as the constructed `CTxMemPool`, so it is safe to use its `CTxMemPool`.\r\n\r\n### A note on checking `CTxMemPool` ctor call sites\r\n\r\nAfter the \"tree-wide: clang-format CTxMemPool references\" commit, you can find all `CTxMemPool` ctor call sites with the following command:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit grep -E -e 'make_unique<CTxMemPool>' \\\r\n            -e '\\bCTxMemPool\\s+[^({;]+[({]' \\\r\n            -e '\\bCTxMemPool\\s+[^;]+;' \\\r\n            -e '\\bnew\\s+CTxMemPool\\b'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the end of the PR, you will find that there are still quite a few call sites that we can seemingly get rid of:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git grep -E -e 'make_unique<CTxMemPool>' -e '\\bCTxMemPool\\s+[^({;]+[({]' -e '\\bCTxMemPool\\s+[^;]+;' -e '\\bnew\\s+CTxMemPool\\b'\r\n# rearranged for easier explication\r\nsrc/init.cpp:        node.mempool = std::make_unique<CTxMemPool>(node.fee_estimator.get(), mempool_check_ratio);\r\nsrc/test/util/setup_common.cpp:    m_node.mempool = std::make_unique<CTxMemPool>(m_node.fee_estimator.get(), 1);\r\nsrc/rpc/mining.cpp:        CTxMemPool empty_mempool;\r\nsrc/test/util/setup_common.cpp:    CTxMemPool empty_pool;\r\nsrc/bench/mempool_stress.cpp:    CTxMemPool pool;\r\nsrc/bench/mempool_stress.cpp:    CTxMemPool pool;\r\nsrc/test/fuzz/rbf.cpp:    CTxMemPool pool;\r\nsrc/test/fuzz/tx_pool.cpp:    CTxMemPool tx_pool_{/*estimator=*/nullptr, /*check_ratio=*/1};\r\nsrc/test/fuzz/tx_pool.cpp:    CTxMemPool tx_pool_{/*estimator=*/nullptr, /*check_ratio=*/1};\r\nsrc/test/fuzz/validation_load_mempool.cpp:    CTxMemPool pool{};\r\nsrc/txmempool.h:    /** Create a new CTxMemPool.\r\n```\r\nLet's break them down one by one:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/init.cpp:        node.mempool = std::make_unique<CTxMemPool>(node.fee_estimator.get(), mempool_check_ratio);\r\nsrc/test/util/setup_common.cpp:    m_node.mempool = std::make_unique<CTxMemPool>(m_node.fee_estimator.get(), 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNecessary\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/rpc/mining.cpp:        CTxMemPool empty_mempool;\r\nsrc/test/util/setup_common.cpp:    CTxMemPool empty_pool;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are fixed in #25223 where we stop requiring the `BlockAssembler` to have a `CTxMemPool` if it's not going to consult it anyway (as is the case in these two call sites)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/bench/mempool_stress.cpp:    CTxMemPool pool;\r\nsrc/bench/mempool_stress.cpp:    CTxMemPool pool;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixed in #24927.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/test/fuzz/rbf.cpp:    CTxMemPool pool;\r\nsrc/test/fuzz/tx_pool.cpp:    CTxMemPool tx_pool_{/*estimator=*/nullptr, /*check_ratio=*/1};\r\nsrc/test/fuzz/tx_pool.cpp:    CTxMemPool tx_pool_{/*estimator=*/nullptr, /*check_ratio=*/1};\r\nsrc/test/fuzz/validation_load_mempool.cpp:    CTxMemPool pool{};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are all cases where we don't want the `CTxMemPool` state to persist between runs, see the previous section \"A note on using existing mempools\"\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/txmempool.h:    /** Create a new CTxMemPool.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a comment (someone link me to a grep that understands syntax plz thx)",

This would look something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBlockAssembler::BlockAssembler(CChainState& chainstate, const Options& options);\r\nBlockAssembler::CreateNewBlock(const CScript& scriptPubKeyIn, const CTxMemPool* maybe_mempool);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\n\r\nAlthough wholly out of scope for this PR, we could potentially refine the `BlockAssembler` interface further, so that we have:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBlockAssembler::BlockAssembler(CChainState& chainstate, const Options& options);\r\nBlockAssembler::CreateNewBlock(const CScript& scriptPubKeyIn, std::vector<CTransaction>& txs);\r\nBlockAssembler::CreateNewBlock(const CScript& scriptPubKeyIn, const CTxMemPool& mempool);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereby `TestChain100Setup::CreateBlock` and `generateblock` would call the `BlockAssembler::CreateNewBlock` that takes in `CTransaction`s and we can potentially remove `RegenerateCommitments` altogether. All other callers can use the `CTxMemPool` version.",

          "body": "The block index might contain stale blocks that are not part of the main chain. If a malicious peer is able to probe a node's block index for certain stale blocks then it can use this information to fingerprint the node.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving headers (either through a `cmpctblock` or `headers` messages) a node will send `getheaders` if the predecessor of the first header does not exist. This leaks information from the block index if the predecessor of the header is a stale block because no `getheaders` will be sent in that case revealing that the stale block exists in the index.\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents this fingerprinting by sending additional `getheaders` messages in cases where not doing so leaks the existence of stale blocks. To determine when additional messages should be send, we introduce the `PeerManagerImpl::m_chain_tips_sets` map which keeps track of seen chain tips per network, effectively creating a per network view of the node's global block index.  We only try to accept new headers if they connect to anything in our global index and they connect to our active chain or to a chain that was previously sent to us by a peer on the same network. We send a `getheaders` message should these conditions not be met.",

          "title": "[kernel 3a/n] Decouple `CTxMemPool` from `ArgsManager`",
          "body": "This is part of the `libbitcoinkernel` project: #24303, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/18\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the Stage 1 Step 2 description of [the `libbitcoinkernel` project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303), `ArgsManager` will not be part of `libbitcoinkernel`. Therefore, it is important that we remove any dependence on `ArgsManager` by code that will be part of `libbitcoinkernel`. This is the first in a series of PRs aiming to achieve this.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes `CTxMemPool+MempoolAccept`'s dependency on `ArgsManager` by introducing a `CTxMemPool::Options` struct, which is used to specify `CTxMemPool`'s various options at construction time.\r\n\r\nThese options are:\r\n- `-maxmempool` -> `CTxMemPool::Options::max_size`\r\n- `-mempoolexpiry` -> `CTxMemPool::Options::expiry`\r\n- `-limitancestorcount` -> `CTxMemPool::Options::limits::ancestor_count`\r\n- `-limitancestorsize` -> `CTxMemPool::Options::limits::ancestor_size`\r\n- `-limitdescendantcount` -> `CTxMemPool::Options::limits::descendant_count`\r\n- `-limitdescendantsize` -> `CTxMemPool::Options::limits::descendant_size`\r\n\r\nMore context can be gleaned from the commit messages. The important commits are:\r\n\r\n- 56eb479ded8bfb2ef635bb6f3b484f9d5952c70d \"pool: Add and use MemPoolOptions, ApplyArgsManOptions\"\r\n- a1e08b70f3068f4e8def1c630d8f50cd54da7832 \"mempool: Pass in -maxmempool instead of referencing gArgs\"\r\n- 6f4bf3ede5812b374828f08fc728ceded2f10024 \"mempool: Pass in -mempoolexpiry instead of referencing gArgs\"\r\n- 5958a7fe4806599fc620ee8c1a881ca10fa2dd16 \"mempool: Introduce (still-unused) MemPoolLimits\"\r\n\r\nReviewers: Help needed in the following commits (see commit messages):\r\n- a1e08b70f3068f4e8def1c630d8f50cd54da7832 \"mempool: Pass in -maxmempool instead of referencing gArgs\"\r\n- 0695081a797e9a5d7787b78b0f8289dafcc6bff7 \"node/ifaces: Use existing MemPoolLimits\"\r\n\r\nNote to Reviewers: There are perhaps an infinite number of ways to architect `CTxMemPool::Options`, the current one tries to keep it simple, usable, and flexible. I hope we don't spend too much time arguing over the design here since that's not the point. In the case that you're 100% certain that a different design is strictly better than this one in every regard, please show us a fully-implemented branch.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Use the more ergonomic `CTxMemPool::Options` where appropriate\r\n- [x] Doxygen comments for `ApplyArgsManOptions`, `MemPoolOptions`\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nQuestions for Reviewers:\r\n1. Should we use `std::chrono::seconds` for `CTxMemPool::Options::expiry` and `CTxMemPool::m_expiry` instead of an `int64_t`? Something else? (`std::chrono::hours`?)\r\n2. Should I merge `CTxMemPool::Limits` inside `CTxMemPool::Options`?\r\n",

          "body": "This is part of the `libbitcoinkernel` project: #24303, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/18\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis PR moves `{Dump,Load}Mempool` into its own `kernel/mempool_persist` module and introduces `ArgsManager` `node::` helpers in `node/mempool_persist_args`to remove the scattered calls to `GetBoolArg(\"-persistmempool\", DEFAULT_PERSIST_MEMPOOL)`.\r\n\r\nMore context can be gleaned from the commit messages.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOne thing I was reflecting on as I wrote this was that in the long run, I think we should probably invert the validation <-> mempool relationship. Instead of mempool not depending on validation, it might make more sense to have validation not depend on mempool. Not super urgent since `libbitcoinkernel` will include both validation and mempool, but perhaps something for the future.",

This is not optimal, since as a stand-alone library it should not rely on bitcoind's argument parsing logic. Instead, its interfaces should accept control and options structs that control the kernel library's desired configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar work towards decoupling the `ArgsManager` from the kernel has been done in \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25527 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25862.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\nBy moving the `CChainParams` class definition into the kernel and giving it new factory functions `CChainParams::{RegTest,SigNet,Main,TestNet}`it can be constructed without an `ArgsManager` reference, unlike the current factory function `CreateChainParams`.\r\n\r\nThe first few commits remove uses of `ArgsManager` within `CChainParams`. Then the `CChainParams` definition is moved to a new file in the `kernel/` subdirectory.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The ArgsManager belongs into the common library, since the kernel library should not depend on it. See [doc/design/libraries.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/libraries.md) for more information on this rationale.\r\n",

It is also a follow up to #26177.\r\n\r\nIt replaces pull request https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27294, which just moved the constants to a new file, but did not re-declare them as enums.\r\n\r\nThe code move of the chain name constants out of the `chainparamsbase` to their own separate header allows the kernel `chainparams` to no longer include `chainparamsbase`. The `chainparamsbase` contain references to the `ArgsManager` and networking related options that should not belong to the kernel library. Besides this move, the constants are re-declared as enums with helper functions facilitating string conversions.",

The kernel part of the name highlights one of the key functional differences from libbitcoinconsensus and in fact, most libraries: it is a stateful library that can spawn threads, do caching, do I/O, and many other things that one may not normally expect from a library.\r\n\r\nThis statefulness is necessary for libbitcoinkernel's decidedly incremental approach to extracting our consensus engine. This approach favors:\r\n\r\n1. Reusing existing code\r\n...which allows us to be continually integrated with Bitcoin Core and benefit from our extensive test suite\r\n    \r\n2. Incremental decoupling instead of building from scratch\r\n ...which allows us to avoid having to prematurely optimize for a \"perfect\" boundary or API (tends to be highly subjective, non-obvious, may lead to unproductive bike-shedding before we've even done anything meaningful)\r\n\r\nThe work of extracting our consensus engine into a library and making the API ergonomic is likely to be a multi-release project involving multiple contributors. The incremental approach takes this into account and respects the sheer size of work (both in writing code and getting it through review) that needs to be undertaken.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\nPlease see the project board: https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/projects/3\r\n\r\n## The Game Plan\r\n\r\n* [ ] Stage 1\r\n    * [x] Step 1\r\n    * [x] Step 2\r\n    * [ ] Step 3\r\n    * [ ] Step 4\r\n* [ ] Stage 2\r\n\r\n### Stage 1: Extracting out a usable `libbitcoinkernel.{so,dylib,dll}`\r\n#### Step 1: Introduce internal `bitcoin-chainstate` and `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. What `.cpp` files do we need?\r\n\r\nThis `bitcoin-chainstate` executable uses our consensus engine and its build system code will reveal the minimal set of files we need to link in to use our consensus engine as-is. It is important to note that this list of files will serve as a guiding \"North Star\" for this first stage of the plan: as we decouple more and more modules of the codebase from our consensus engine, this list will grow shorter and shorter.\r\n\r\nThis list of files (the `_SOURCES` in `Automake` speak) then serves as the basis for a `libbitcoinkernel`, which `bitcoin-chainstate` will be linked against.\r\n\r\n**Key Result:** Any further coupling of our consensus engine with non-consensus modules will result in linker errors, preventing this project from becoming a Sisyphean task of battling coupling regressions.\r\n#### Step 2: Decouple most non-consensus code from `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. Prune the unnecessary `.cpp` files (and their respective headers)!\r\n\r\nIn this step many modules were removed from the `libbitcoinkernel` that do not logically belong in `libbitcoinkernel` (e.g. `index/*.cpp`, `netaddress.cpp`), but are nevertheless necessary to be included in its `_SOURCES` for `bitcoin-chainstate` to link correctly.\r\n\r\n**Developer Note:** We do not decouple the mempool _yet_ because most users of `libbitcoinkernel` may want to have an embedded mempool with Bitcoin Core's policies and we can decouple it later. This stage is more about extracting obvious non-kernel functionality, like argument parsing, or shutdown handling, than it is about extracting Bitcoin Core specific functionality like assumevalid, assumeutxo, checkpoints, or the mempool. Such extractions fall under stage 2.\r\n\r\nCompleting handling of the shutdown code might run parallel to the remaining steps, or even extend to stage 2. The problem is that a user of the library might trigger a fatal error, without the function returning an error code. The user might then call further functions, which could be unsafe.\r\n\r\n#### Step 3: Decouple most non-consensus headers from `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. Prune the unnecessary `.h` files!\r\n\r\nSimilar to Step 2, there are lots of small decoupling of the header dependency tree here. A notable piece of this step is to remove `leveldb` includes from our headers to avoid needing to re-ship `leveldb` headers. Another is removing the `boost` multiindex includes currently required by our mempool headers.\r\n\r\n* [x] Prune boost/signal headers\r\n* [ ] Prune leveldb headers\r\n* [ ] Prune boost/multiindex headers\r\n* [x] Prune univalue includes\r\n\r\n#### Step 4: Use the `libbitcoinkernel` library for internal compilation\r\n\r\nNow that `libbitcoinkernel` contains some minimal set of source files, it should also be used as an internal library for `libbitcoin_node`. The desired library organization is shown in [doc/design/libraries.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/libraries.md).\r\n\r\n### Stage 2: Polishing the API / Continual De-coupling\r\n\r\nAt this point, we have a usable `libbitcoinkernel` that is _somewhat_ minimally linked. However, it has a very idiosyncratic, Bitcoin Core-specific C++ interface. The goal of this stage is to incrementally make the `libbitcoinkernel` API more ergonomic for users outside of Bitcoin Core. Bindings to other languages (first C, then others) should be introduced. Note though, that there is a possible dichotomy here between optimizing the library interface for external users and for the internal interface within Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nIt is crucial that multiple contributors collaboratively lead this stage. Ideally, they would be able to work with users looking to integrate with `libbitcoinkernel` who can give an accurate account of the API ergonomics from the library user's point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting `libbitcoinkernel` Through Review\r\n\r\nThe following ground rules were proposed to make this process more streamlined for all parties involved and a few things this tracking issue can help with:\r\n\r\n1. Any outstanding comments/reviews not pertinent to the main thrust of PRs should not delay/block the merging of the core functionality of PRs. Any leftover comments/reviews not tackled in the PR will be taken note of in the TODO section below and then either triaged in an issue or addressed in a separate PR.     \r\n2. Whenever the PR reaches a stage where there are only leftover comments/reviews left, the author should make a comment saying so. This might make it easier for maintainers to determine roughly where the PR is at in its lifecycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Action Items\r\n\r\n1. If you have any questions, please post them below!\r\n 2. If you plan on reviewing `libbitcoinkernel` or are a maintainer:       \r\n       1. Please make sure you've read the \"Getting `libbitcoinkernel` Through Review\" section above.\r\n       2. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help streamline the review process.\r\n3. If you have any ideas for the future direction of \"Stage 2: Polishing the API / Continual De-coupling\", please leave a comment below, I'd love to talk!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Project-wide TODOs\r\n\r\nThese are suggestions for further cleanup and improvements that came up during review:\r\n\r\n* [ ]  Various followups for [[kernel 2c/n] Introduce `kernel::Context`, encapsulate global init/teardown #25065](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065)\r\n  * [ ]  Marco's post-merge review comments: [[kernel 2c/n] Introduce `kernel::Context`, encapsulate global init/teardown #25065 (review)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065#pullrequestreview-996614232)\r\n  * [ ]  Cory's `kernel::Context` cleanup suggestions: [[kernel 2c/n] Introduce `kernel::Context`, encapsulate global init/teardown #25065 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065#discussion_r882182549)\r\n* [ ]  Russell's post-merge review comment: [[kernel 2e/n] miner: Make `mempool` optional, stop constructing temporary empty mempools #25223 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25223#discussion_r898164322)\r\n* [ ]  Various followups for [[kernel 3a/n] Decouple `CTxMemPool` from `ArgsManager` #25290](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290)\r\n  * [ ]  Perform gArgs checking in `ApplyArgsManOptions`: [[kernel 3a/n] Decouple `CTxMemPool` from `ArgsManager` #25290 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290#discussion_r907535652)\r\n  * [ ]  Perform `CTxMemPool::Options` checking in `CTxMemPool` constructor: [[kernel 3a/n] Decouple `CTxMemPool` from `ArgsManager` #25290 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290#discussion_r900272797)\r\n  * [x]  Change `CalculateMemPoolAncestors` to take in `CTxMemPool::Limits` instead: [[kernel 3a/n] Decouple `CTxMemPool` from `ArgsManager` #25290 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290#discussion_r905260891)\r\n* [ ]  Various followups for [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487)\r\n  * [ ]  Improve `DumpMempool`'s mutex: [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r916228022)\r\n  * [ ]  Change `LoadMempool`'s semantics: [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r916044902)\r\n  * [ ]  Make LoadMempool less foot-gunny: [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r921234107), [c4249c1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/c4249c1243981f42091950d1295c2be6bd4bf118)\r\n* [ ] Various followups for [refactor, kernel: Decouple ArgsManager from blockstorage #27125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125)\r\n  * [ ] Martin's request for a follow-up fixing the docstring: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125#discussion_r1190350876\r\n* [ ]  Follwups for [kernel: Remove util/system from kernel library, interface_ui from validation #27636](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636)\r\n  * [ ] Cory's request for cleaning up the kernel interface functions of pointer and reference types: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1202937682\r\n  * [ ] Russell's request for eliminating the BlockNotify signal: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1193904693\r\n  \r\n#### Other various items that arose during review and should be tracked\r\n* Marco's request for a minimal iwyu memory include false positive example: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125#discussion_r1184832621\r\n* Marcos' request for unrolling the reindex loop: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125#discussion_r1183633068\r\n* Marco's request for getting rid of exceptions in the `ArgsManager`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27491#discussion_r1189586654\r\n* Russell's request for getting rid of `fWarned`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1193969953",
