    "title": "Question on Changing Bitcoin Blockchain Data Directory in Linux Without Redownloading",
    "body": "Hello Bitcoin Community,\r\n\r\nI’m looking for some guidance on how to change the default data directory for the Bitcoin blockchain on a Linux system. I want to move the blockchain data to a different drive with more space, but I’d prefer not to download the entire blockchain from scratch.\r\n\r\nCould someone walk me through the steps to move the data seamlessly, ensuring that all configurations are correctly updated? Any tips to avoid issues during the process would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help!",
