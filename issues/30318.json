    "title": "Fuzzing related configuration/build options can be improved",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\r\n\r\nThe fuzzing related configuration options are somewhat confusing and redundant and can be simplified.\r\n\r\nTLDR: currently `--enable-fuzz` does not enable fuzzing.\r\n\r\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\r\n\r\nThanks for the [discussion](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2024-06-20.html#l-248) yesterday. Correct me if I am wrong below. There are the following options (to `./configure` and in the coming CMake replacement):\r\n\r\n* `--enable-fuzz`: only disables compiling all other targets (e.g. `src/bitcoind`) and forces `--enable-fuzz-binary=yes` (default no). Other targets should be disabled because the fuzzing framework provides its own `main()` function. Note that this option does not engage the fuzzing framework. That is, it does not enable fuzzing.\r\n* `--enable-fuzz-binary`: whether to compile `src/test/fuzz/fuzz` (default yes)\r\n* `--with-sanitizers=fuzzer`: engage the fuzzing framework, ie enable fuzzing.\r\n\r\nWithout the fuzzing framework (`--with-sanitizers=fuzzer`) `src/test/fuzz/fuzz` cannot do fuzzing but it can run existent inputs from e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/tree/main/fuzz_seed_corpus (phony fuzz binary). So currently all of the below produce such a phony fuzz binary:\r\n* compiling by default without any options\r\n* compiling with `--enable-fuzz`\r\n* compiling with `--enable-fuzz-binary`\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIdeally there should be one boolean option which enables/disables fuzzing instead of 3:\r\n\r\n* when enabled: engage the fuzzing harness (compile with `-fsanitize=fuzzer`), force compiling `src/test/fuzz/fuzz` (if it is even possible to disable it via another option), force disable all other targets\r\n* when disabled: don't use `-fsanitize=fuzzer`, leave alone `src/test/fuzz/fuzz` and other build targets to be decided by other options. If `src/test/fuzz/fuzz` is to be build, then create a \"phony fuzz\" binary which cannot do fuzzing but can execute existent fuzz inputs.\r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThe \"enabled/disabled\" option can be implicit - if `--with-sanitizers=...,fuzzer,...` is used then do as \"when enabled\" above.\r\n",

      "body": "There are a few things that `--enable-fuzz` does that we definitely want it to do:\r\n\r\n* As you said, this option disables all other binaries besides the `fuzz` binary. This is nice when you only want to do fuzzing and nothing else (e.g. oss-fuzz). It is also required for the use of libFuzzer (`--with-sanitizers=fuzzer` i.e. `-fsanitize=fuzzer` with clang), because the other binaries provide a main function.\r\n* libFuzzer is not the only fuzzing engine. We would like to support as many engines as possible and we don't want to enable `-fsanitize=fuzzer` by default because that is not guaranteed to work with other engines. For example, to build for fuzzing with afl++: `CC=afl-clang-fast CXX=afl-clang-fast++ ./configure --enable-fuzz && make`. We have a custom harness for fuzzing with afl++ (see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a961ad1bebc54912b88d072abf22ab7d3cf46bf1/src/test/fuzz/fuzz.cpp#L222-L225)).\r\n\r\nWe could rename the option if that helps but we shouldn't change the way it works. I'm not even sure if a rename is worth it given that it would break every fuzzing script. Our docs explain how to properly setup fuzzing as well (including instructions for various other engines).",
