    "title": "Finding peers to connect to after -onlynet changes may be problematic",
    "body": "**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core, ideally, should always have peers to try to connect to just like when started for the very first time (empty `peers.dat`). It should not be more difficult to find possible peers if it was ran before with a different `-onlynet=` setting.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nIf addrman has some entries, even to only unreachable networks, due to previous runs and changes in `-onlynet`, then the fixed seeds will not be used.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nRun with `-onlynet=ipv4`, change to `-onlynet=i2p`.\r\n\r\n**To fix**\r\n\r\nThis problem is two-fold:\r\n\r\n1. Fixed seeds should be used if we have 0 reachable peers in addrman. I guess this condition should be relaxed, like discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25678#issuecomment-1238542029\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fc44d1796e4df5824423d7d13de3082fe204db7d/src/net.cpp#L1628\r\n\r\n2. Even if there are a few reachable peers in addrman, e.g. 0.1% it will take a long time before they are tried. The address selection logic can be improved. It is, simplified, like this (see lines [1797](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fc44d1796e4df5824423d7d13de3082fe204db7d/src/net.cpp#L1797) and [1810](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fc44d1796e4df5824423d7d13de3082fe204db7d/src/net.cpp#L1810)):\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect random address\r\nif not reachable then try another random address\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan be improved to \"select random address, but only from reachable networks\".\r\n\r\nThis problem is amplified by the fact that we do not save non-reachable addresses in addrman during p2p gossip (and also see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25678). Maybe we should reconsider that as a 3rd fixup, in addition to the above 2 - save even unreachable addresses in addrman during p2p gossip and fixed seeds loadup? What is the worst that can happen? We will have some wasted space in addrman if `onlynet` is never altered?",

          "title": "p2p: skip querying dns seeds if `-onlynet` disables IPv4 and IPv6",
          "body": "Currently, `-onlynet` does not work well in connection with initial peer discovery, because DNS seeds only resolve to IPv6 and IPv4 adresses:\r\nWith `-onlynet=i2p`, we would load clearnet addresses from DNS seeds into addrman, be content our addrman isn't empty so we don't try to query hardcoded seeds (although these exist for i2p!), and never attempt to make an automatic outbound connection.\r\nWith `-onlynet=onion` and `-proxy` set, we wouldn't load addresses via DNS, but will make AddrFetch connections (through a tor exit node) to a random clearnet peer the DNS seed resolves to (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6808#issuecomment-147652505), thus breaching the `-onlynet` preference of the user - this has been reported in the two issues listed below.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes two changes:\r\n1.) Don't load addresses that are unreachable (so that we wouldn't connect to them) into addrman. This is already the case for addresses received via p2p addr messages, this PR implements the same for addresses received from DNS seeds and fixed seeds. This means that in the case of `-onlynet=onion`, we wouldn't load fixed seed IPv4 addresses into addrman, only the onion ones.\r\n2.) Skip trying the DNS seeds if neither IPv4 nor IPv6 are reachable and move directly to adding the hardcoded seeds from networks we can connect to. This is done by soft-setting `-dnsseed` to 0 in this case, unless `-dnsseed=1` was explicitly specified, in which case we abort with an `InitError`.\r\n\r\nFixes #6808\r\nFixes #12344",

          "body": "AddrMan currently doesn't track the number of its entries by network, it only knows the total number of addresses. This PR makes AddrMan keep track of these numbers, which would be helpful for multiple things:\r\n\r\n1. Allow to specifically add fixed seeds to AddrMan of networks where we don't have any addresses yet - even if AddrMan as a whole is not empty (partly fixing #26035). This is in particular helpful if the user abruptly changes `-onlynet` settings (such that addrs that used to be reachable are no longer and vice versa), in which case they currently could get stuck and not find any outbound peers. The second commit of this PR implements this.\r\n1. (Future work): Add logic for automatic connection management with respect to networks - such as making attempts to have at least one connection to each reachable network as suggested [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26035#issuecomment-1249420209). This would involve requesting an address from a particular network from AddrMan, and expanding its corresponding function `AddrMan::Select()`  to do this requires internal knowledge of the current number of addresses for each network and table to avoid getting stuck in endless loops.\r\n1. (Future work): Perhaps display the totals to users. At least I would find this helpful to debug, the existing option (`./bitcoin-cli -addrinfo`) is rather indirect by doing the aggregation itself in each call, doesn't distinguish between new and tried, and being based on `AddrMan::GetAddr()` it's also subject to a quality filter which we probably don't want in this spot.",
