      "body": "> To me it seems that this could partition the network. In the addresses database of my node there are 2778 addresses that have advertised v2 out of 72821 total.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to respond and consider my feature request.\r\n\r\nI understand your concern about potential network partitioning, but I believe that similar risks exist with other features in Bitcoin as well. While I acknowledge that relying solely on V2 protocol connections may limit the available nodes, I believe it's crucial for those who rely on V2 for verifying the authenticity of connections.\r\n\r\n> For ensuring you really connect to the intended node (avoid MITM) using Tor or I2P may be easier or better alternative. In those networks the address represents the peer's public key and naturally when you establish a connection you know you are talking to the one who possesses the private key which corresponds to the address / public key.\r\n\r\nRegarding your suggestion about using Tor or I2P connections, I appreciate the alternative, but it's important to note that some corporate networks restrict or outright disallow connections over these networks. Additionally, in certain regions, Tor and I2P connections may be filtered out, making it essential to have the option to connect over regular IPV4 and IPV6. In such cases, being able to identify V2 connections can be instrumental.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, while it's true that V2 protocol usage alone does not guarantee protection against MITM attacks, it does provide an additional layer of security, especially for those who require confirmation of a \"bonafide\" node.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I still believe that having the ability to specify V2 protocol connections would be beneficial, particularly in scenarios where other options are restricted or unavailable.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> We have various other options that could partition the network (`-onlynet`) or have other bad consequences (`-nolisten`, `-blocksonly`, `-prune`) if everyone used them, plus we could add a warning in the doc that only users who actually need it should use it.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of updating the docs to reflect what it is, the use cases for it, and why you shouldn't just do it without thinking about the overall impact.\r\n\r\n> `listen` usually refers to inbound connections, this should be an option that applies to both outbound and inbound connections (maybe a third option to `-v2transport`).\r\n\r\nGreat points, I do imagine this applying to inbound and outbound so this makes sense. My bad on giving it a \"listen\" indication as I just sort of had this idea after reviewing some logs from some less friendly countries and came here and tapped out the feature request without giving it as much thought as I should have.\r\n\r\nI'd also say it would be even better if you had granular control if it applied to one or the other but understand the simplicity of just making it apply across the board.",
