    "title": "Static Qt5 in Linux builds",
    "body": "I see the Linux builds for 0.11.0rc1 are statically linked to Qt5, where previously they were dynamically linked to Qt4. I'm glad for the upgrade, not so much the static linking. Is there a reason for this, and could it be referenced in the release notes? My argument against would be, unlike OpenSSL, it's not consensus critical, and it's more important to be consistent with the distribution for look and feel. I realize this would reduce support for older distro versions. Alternately, could the static build be updated to the latest Qt (5.4 instead of 5.2)?\n\nSpecific issues I'm seeing, under KDE 5 / Fedora 22:\n- Doesn't look like the system theme\n- Systray icon missing (KDE 5 dropped support for the old xembed systray in favor of the appindicator/status-notifier protocol; handled transparently in Qt 5.4 and distro-patched 4.8)\n\nI've compiled successfully against Qt 5.4.1, but can't actually test as Red Hat's lawyers are still hobbling secp256k1 in their OpenSSL package. Happy to test if an upstream build is done.\n",

      "body": "Because it's the most compatible option. I was against statically linking Qt first as well (because of the desktop integration problems), see discussion in #4284, but was eventually convinced because all the other options are even worse.\n\nGist of the matter is, that there is no good way to distribute portable GUI executables on Linux. Blame the weird ecosystem. Also now that libstdc++ is linked statically (another compatibility compromise, #5819) there is no other option than to link all c++ libraries as static.\n\nUpgrading the static Qt version is fine with me, if that helps anything. Should be straightforward - see `depends/packages/qt.mk`.\n",

      "body": "The Qt build system infers the default include path by parsing the output of g++ -v (qtbase/configure, line 3326, \"Auto-detect default include and library search paths\"). This is affected by the CPATH and QMAKE_CFLAGS settings in depends/packages/qt.mk. Simply deleting those works to get the top level include path back into the .pc files, but breaks the static OpenSSL linkage. What does work is to add the identical CPATH to the bitcoin build environment.\n\nTragically, after all that, the system theme and systray problems are still there. It would seem that the change in Qt 5.4 was not to automatically support the new systray, but rather just some refactoring that enabled KDE to hook into it via the system theme engine -- which only works with the shared Qt.\n\nI'll still PR my work on the version bump, but not for 0.11 -- no point holding up the schedule if it doesn't solve the problem.\n",

I realized I never committed the OS X descriptor, so this branch was originally intented to commit the OS X descriptor. Currently it does not include the OS X descriptor, because I haven't been able to fully test it due to the depends system using Python 3, but the Armory code still using Python 2. That causes a conflict when building _CppBlockUtils.so. However, the Gitian build does get as far as building _CppBlockUtils.so, so I can just commit the descriptor now if you want.\n\nI also included a commit from theuni that I got from the Bitcoin Core repo. I was doing it to try to resolve an issue I was having (turned out to not fix the issue, something else did), but I'll leave it, because I figure it is good to try to keep up with relevant changes to the depends system in Bitcoin Core.\n",

(Linux distro packagers aren't happy either...)\n\nBy switching to submodules, I've reduced the download size to 76M, and disk space needed to build from ~2G to ~600M. (The multi-source support in the depends system leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion, but at least it works.) Another nice result is that any future additional Qt submodules will be skipped by default, rather than having to add more -skip configure options.\n",
