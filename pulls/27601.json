    "body": "If the transaction includes an output that goes to the custom change\r\naddress (`CoinControl::destChange`), the transaction creation process\r\nshould avoid creating duplicate outputs to the same address.\r\n\r\nInstead, it should reuse the existing output to prevent revealing which\r\naddress is the change address, which could compromise privacy.\r\n\r\nThis will also be useful to make other wallet processes less confusing\r\nand error-prone. For instance, within the bumpfee functionality, we\r\nmanually extract the change recipient from the transaction before calling\r\n'CreateTransaction' to ensure that the change output is not duplicated.\r\n\r\nSide note:\r\nThis is something that will be using for the #26732 rework.",

Dumping all the information to disk at once atomically at the end of the process.\r\n\r\nThen, for BDB, fixed places where we are flushing to db directly on individual writes. e.g we do it in the in the chain sync/scan process, when an output that belongs to the wallet is found if the address is not inside the address book. \r\n\r\nPlus, in several places across the wallet flows, we create new `WalletBatch` objects. Which, internally, mean: Increasing the db references number, try to open the db and, for SQLite, setup and bind the statements.\r\nThis PR avoids all this overhead by sharing the same db handler instance through each entire workflow.",

          "body": "Currently `FundTransaction` handles transaction locktime and preset input data by extracting the selected inputs and change output from `CreateTransaction`'s results. This means that `CreateTransaction` is actually unaware of any user desired locktime or sequence numbers. This can have an effect on whether and how anti-fee-sniping works.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `CreateTransaction` aware of the locktime and preset input data by providing them to `CCoinControl`. `CreateTransasction` will then set the sequences, scriptSigs, scriptWItnesses, and locktime as appropriate if they are specified. This allows `FundTransaction` to actually use `CreateTransaction`'s result directly instead of having to extract the parts of it that it wants.\r\n\r\nAdditionally `FundTransaction` will return a `CreateTransactionResult` as `CreateTransaction` does instead of having several output parameters. Lastly, instead of using `-1` as a magic number for the change output position, the change position is changed to be an optional with no value set indicating no desired change output position (when provided as an input parameter) or no change output present (in the result).",

          "body": "Depends on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27601, please go there first.\r\n\r\nThis work aims to define, and implement a base standard mechanism to\r\ndetect individual change outputs.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nCurrently, the wallet detects whether an output is change or not based\r\non data stored in the address book.\r\n\r\nThere is no notion of “change outputs”, the wallet detects change scripts.\r\n\r\nConnoting that any address book record modification has implications\r\non all the historical outputs related to that particular destination. Meaning\r\nthat all those outputs can either be change or not. There is no middle-ground\r\ngranular distinction.\r\n\r\n#### How Change Detection Currently Works?\r\n\r\nThe wallet walks-through the transaction outputs, extracts the script\r\ndestination and verify the following two points:\r\n\r\n1) If the destination doesn't exist in the address book, then the script\r\n    is a \"change address\".\r\n   \r\n2) If the destination exists in the address book, but it doesn't have a\r\n     label, then the script is a \"change address\".\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are a good number of problems in the current approach:\r\n\r\n- We make the wallet dependent on an external structure, with separate storage.\r\n   Which has to be updated and maintained along with the wallet state.\r\n\r\n- It cannot be maintained nor recovered across different wallet instances.\r\n   Cannot re-create the, possibly custom, address book data only by importing\r\n   the wallet descriptor string.\r\n\r\n- As the address book is an structure that the user can freely modify, the change\r\n   detection process might differ through different wallets.\r\n \r\n- The current rudimentary assumptions of \"no address book entry\" or \"no label set for the address book entry\"\r\n  to denote that certain script destination is change or not can easily be broken:\r\n  E.g. derive an address from one of the wallet’s external paths manually. Then send coins to it.\r\n  As the receive destination wasn't created inside the wallet, the wallet has no associated address book entry.\r\n  So, the reception is invalidly detected as change (added a test case for it).\r\n\r\n- The wallet can't detect change outputs on more complex scripts such as multi-sig change outputs.\r\n\r\n- The wallet is not able to detect change outputs going to an internal address if the internal address has a label.\r\n  (E.g. the user can manually set a label for the internal address and, doing that, make that all the change\r\n  outputs, in the wallet history, that were sent to the destination are no longer detected as change).\r\n\r\n- There isn’t a way to distinguish the external reception of coins into an internal address. Coins reception on any\r\n   internal address are always detected as change.\r\n\r\n### New Change Detection Mechanism Goals\r\n\r\nAiming to:\r\n\r\n* Define a base mechanism to align different wallet implementations. Preventing each piece of software\r\n  from diverging on the basic change outputs distinction.\r\n\r\n* Detect change outputs on-demand without requiring to maintain an external data structure synced with the\r\n   latest wallet state.\r\n\r\n* Independently, and accurately, detect change outputs regardless data stored in structures that the user\r\n   can freely modify.\r\n\r\n* Granular distinction between change vs non-change outputs that were sent to the same internal address.\r\n  E.g. the reception of coins, from an external source, on internal addresses will not longer be detected\r\n  as change anymore.\r\n\r\n* Expand the change detection to more complex scripts such as a multi-sig protected addresses. (While they\r\n  are added into the wallet on an internal spkm)\r\n\r\n#### Change Output Detection Rules\r\n\r\nA transaction output is change if it fulfills the following points:\r\n\r\n1) At least one of the parent transaction inputs is from the wallet. (If none of them are, then the wallet is receiving coins\r\n    on an internal address).\r\n\r\n2) The script extracted destination is from the wallet and is located in one of the internal script pub key manager.\r\n    (e.g. derived from an internal derivation path)\r\n\r\n#### What about legacy wallets?\r\n\r\nIf the legacy wallet is HD post-split, we have an internal derivation path, so we can follow the same process as\r\ndescriptors wallet. Unless the destination is on the pre-split key pool, in which case, we fallback to the follow-up\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nIf the legacy wallet is pre-split, we continue using the address book as we either have an HD wallet with keys\r\nderived only on the external path, or we are using raw keypool.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————\r\n\r\n#### Extra Note\r\nThis PR, in about 85% at least, is about expanding the current test coverage for the change output detection area.\r\n\r\n#### TO DO (still WIP):\r\n\r\n* [x] Save “internal” flag on non-active descriptors so the wallet can use them on the change detection process.\r\n   (which will fix the currently failing test cases).\r\n* [ ] Re-organize commits so tests always pass.\r\n* [ ] Verify backwards compatibility.",

          "body": "## For reviewers\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to make reviewing a bit more sane, I'm breaking this up into a few smaller PRs, but will keep this one open as the parent PR and keep it rebased on the child PRs. The main purpose of having this PR is to track progress on child PRs and also have an easy way to compile `bitcoind` with both send and receive support for testing. Additionally, I'll be adding more functional tests to this PR since it's much easier to test when `bitcoind` can both send and receive.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122\r\n  - Implements the logic from BIP352 without any wallet code. This PR adds the necessary cryptographic functions and implements the logic needed for sending and scanning. This PR also includes the test vectors from the BIP as unit tests. Both the send and receive PRs have this as a dependency. In terms of priority, this PR should be reviewed first\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201\r\n  - Implements sending in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to send to a silent payment address, regardless of whether or not the wallet can receive silent payments\r\n  - Ready for review, but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28202\r\n  - Implements receiving in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to generate silent payment addresses and scan for silent payments, regardless of whether or not the wallet can send to a silent payment address\r\n  - Ready for review but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n\r\nFor the silent payments specification, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458\r\n\r\n## Overall\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the full silent payments scheme: sending and receiving. The following items are not covered in this PR and are intended for follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n* Adding labels for the receiver wallet\r\n* Full RPC coverage (only `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` are covered in this PR)\r\n* Light client support (vending the tweak data per block, either in an index or to serve to indexer, such as electrum server)\r\n* Add benchmarks to validate that there are no DoS concerns for doing silent payment verification for transactions in the mempool\r\n* External signer support (dependent on hardware wallets supporting silent payments)\r\n* More unit / functional test coverage\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24897. Below is a summary of the major changes:\r\n\r\n* Remove labels\r\n  * The original draft included labels, but this has been deferred for a later PR. Labels are not necessary for sending and receiving and there are still some open questions on how best to implement them in Bitcoin Core. Labels can also be added at any point by the receiver without requiring any changes from the sender\r\n* Remove indexes\r\n  * In the original draft, indexes were used when scanning for silent payments and when doing wallet rescans. This has been removed in favor of using `rev*.dat` files for rescanning. It may make sense to add an index in the future, but for the purpose of vending tweak data to light clients, which is still an open question\r\n* Update to implement the most current version of BIP352\r\n  * Since the original draft, there have been a few changes in the BIP which are reflected in the current PR. Most notably, using 33-byte compressed keys for the silent payment address (as opposed to X-only keys in the original draft) \r\n\r\nIt may be helpful for context to read through the discussions on #24897 , but ongoing review should happen in the relevant child PRs listed above.",

They were only intermediate results used to calculate other values.\r\n* Excluded the change cost from the waste score when the transaction already accounts for it.\r\n* In transactions with an existing change output, the spending process will no longer compute all the change related coin selection params.

Otherwise, if the output script associated with the custom change address  matches an existing output on the original transaction, it should fail and request more precise instructions from the user.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I agree that a surveillant seeing the same output script in the original and replacement transaction but with different amounts would have a strong hint that it’s the change.

Not sure why it should\r\nbehave differently for change outputs only.\r\n\r\nRight now, the user cannot duplicate outputs in any of the wallet related RPC commands.\r\nThey are all blocking dup output scripts (Check `ConstructTransaction`, inside `AddOutputs`).\r\nOnly the change output is auto-magically duplicated by the wallet without the user consent.\r\n\r\nThe only way for users to duplicate outputs destinations is to use the `createrawtransaction`\r\ncommand. Which I think that is good, the wallet RPC related commands should be \"safe\" to\r\nuse (they shouldn't duplicate outputs automatically nor do stuff that can leak information),\r\nand then the raw creation commands should be rules free for people to do whatever they want.\r\n\r\n\r\n> > Instead, it should reuse the existing output to prevent revealing which\r\n> > address is the change address, which could compromise privacy.\r\n> \r\n> No, reusing the output reveals the change since the amount changes.\r\n\r\nDepends on the context. If this is used to bump certain transaction, the outcome is\r\npractically the same for both. Either increasing the single change output or creating another\r\noutput with the same script compromises privacy (more if we are the only software doing it).\r\n\r\nBut, for transactions being funded (not published), it is worst to create a tx with\r\ntwo outputs going to the same script rather than increasing the amount of one of them.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI think that if your concern is about allowing the user to have a second output going to\r\nthe same change address, they could also do it with this as well. They just need to\r\ncraft a raw transaction with two outputs going to the change address. The wallet\r\nwill take one of them as change, and increase it.\r\n\r\nStill, will think more about this. I'm feeling that you surely have a point (other than\r\nthe ones written above) but I'm not seeing it yet. It feels that it is related to a\r\n\"use existing change output if exist\" option instead of automatically using one of\r\nthe outputs when it matches to the user provided change destination.\r\n\r\nBut.. this last thing also sound weird. The user provided the outputs, and also set\r\na custom change destination that matches one of them. So.. it should be more than\r\nfine to interpret it as \"use this output for change\". ",

          "body": "For silent payments, we want to provide a `SilentPaymentsDestination` to be used as the recipient, which requires `CRecipient` to use something other than just the `scriptPubKey` as we cannot know the output script for a silent payment prior to transaction creation. `CTxDestination` seems like the obvious place to add a `SilentPaymentsDestination` as it is our internal representation of an address.\r\n\r\nIn order to still allow paying to arbitrary scriptPubKeys (e.g. for data carrier outputs, or the user hand crafted a raw transaction that they have given to `fundrawtransaction`), `CNoDestination` is changed to contain raw scripts.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, P2PK scripts are now interpreted as a new `PubKeyDestination` rather than `PKHash`. This results in some things that would have given an address for P2PK scripts to no longer do so. This is arguably more correct.\r\n\r\n`ExtractDestination`'s behavior is slightly changed for the above. It now returns `true` for those destinations that have addresses, so P2PK scripts now result in `false`. Even though it returns false for `CNoDestination`, the script will now be included in that `CNoDestination`.\r\n\r\nBuilds on #28244",

This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing. Labels for the receiver are optional and thus deferred for a later PR.\r\n\r\nTest vectors from the BIP are included as unit tests.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing, it is strongly recommended you read https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458 and take a look at the reference python implementation on the BIP.\r\n",

It builds on top of #28122.\r\n\r\nIt also adds a `getsilentpaymentblockdata` RPC that returns an array of silent payment tweaked public keys, one for each qualifying transaction. \r\n\r\nThis index serves two purposes:\r\n1. Light client support, see [BIP 352](https://github.com/josibake/bips/blob/silent-payments-bip/bip-0352.mediawiki#user-content-Tweak_Data)\r\n2. A more thorough check than the test vectors; e.g. by comparing a checksum of the index for all of mainnet.\r\n\r\nBased on the index that was originally part of #24897.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] check correctness against another implementation\r\n- [ ] make `-silentpaymentindex=0` mean off (default), `-silentpaymentindex=v0` on\r\n- [ ] figure out how to do versioning (make the index flexible enough, or just rebuild the index at the next version)\r\n- [ ] remove dependency on wallet (move `GetSilentPaymentsTweakDataFromTxInputs` and everything it needs out of the wallet)\r\n- [ ] cleanup various TODO's in the code\r\n- [ ] brainstorm updating index when outputs are spent\r\n- add tests\r\n  - [ ] that a reorg adds the new blocks (and it's fine to keep the old one) ",

This left two functions with largely overlapping purpose, where one was simply a wrapper of the other. This PR cleans up the overlap, and fixes the double-meaning of `change_cost` where the `GetChange()` function assumed that no change was created when `change_cost` was set to 0. This behavior was exploited in a bunch of tests, but is problematic, because a `change_cost` of 0 is permitted with custom settings for feerate and discard_feerate (i.e. when they’re both 0).",

Because this is unexpected of our users, we shouldn't make assumptions about why they may be doing this and should instead tell them that they've done something unexpected.",

It should tell the user that they've done something wrong, as we do in the RPCs. I agree with @murchandamus's suggestion.\r\n\r\nOk, great. We are almost on the same page. There is one point about Murch's suggestion that makes some noise in my head.\r\n\r\n#### Describing the general process first:\r\nWhen the user manually specifies a custom change address/script, the transaction creation and transaction funding processes are instructed to follow one of the following option:\r\n1) If there is an existing output matching the user provided change destination: the process will send the change amount to the existing output.\r\n2) If there is no output matching the user provided change destination: the process will create a new output under the provided destination and send the change amount to it.\r\n\r\n#### Murch's suggestion:\r\nThe only difference between the general process description and what murch suggested is the following one; he said to only perform (1) when the wallet organically detect the custom change address provided by the user as change (which makes the existing output matching this address also change). In other words, he said to only perform (1) when the wallet's `IsChange()` returns true for the provided destination.\r\n\r\n#### Now, the discussion point.\r\nWhat is the point behind forbidding this action? Does it have any advantage over the current status?\r\n\r\nIf the concerns are related to sending the change amount to an address not owned by the wallet; that is already possible today. Simply by specifying a custom change address, the user can send the change amount to any destination. This is part of the contract behind the utilization of the custom change address option.\r\n\r\nMy perspective is that what this PR introduces isn't radically different from our current process. The only difference arises when one of the user's manually specified outputs matches the user's manually specified change address. In such cases, we will increase the existing output instead of creating a second output going to the same address.\r\n\r\nI mean, I feel that what we are introducing here is a natural behavior rather than something unexpected. As a user, if I provide a custom change address that relates to one of the outputs that I provided, it suggests my intention to send the change to the existing output. I don't think that anyone would expect another behavior.\r\n\r\nBut, having that said, I agree with you that we should explicitly state this behavior on the RPC custom change address option description. So there are no doubts about it.\r\n\r\nWould you agree with this rationale, or do you still have second thoughts about it?",

          "body": "This PR implements receiving silent payment transactions through the use of a new `ScriptPubKeyMan` type: `SilentPaymentsSPKM`. This is a descriptor wallet only feature, although it does not use descriptors.\r\n\r\nThis is an optional feature, so the only way to use it is to create a new wallet with `createwallet` with `silent_payments=true`. Such wallets will have a single `SilentPaymentsSPKM` that is used for both receiving and change. Since silent payments only have a single address, repeated calls to `getnewaddress` and `getrawchangeaddress` always return the same address, however the receiving and change addresses are different, see the BIP for how the change is generated.\r\n\r\nSince silent payments requires the spent coins in order to extract public keys from them, `TransactionAddedToMempool` is modified to also provide that information. For scanning blocks, the wallet will retrieve that information from the undo data. Additionally, when rescanning, a silent payments wallet must use the slow rescan method.\r\n\r\nThe labels feature has not been fully implemented yet and is left for a followup.\r\n\r\nBased on #28122 and #28201 \r\n\r\nAlternative to #28202",

From your experience, does it sound like realistic use-case?\r\n\r\nYeah those sound like things that I would consider doing if I were operating a high-volume wallet, e.g. in a multi-wallet setup the receive-only wallet could send change to the cold-wallet when topping up the send-only withdrawal wallet.\r\n",

Is there a way for us to reliably distinguish those two scenarios?\r\n\r\nEither way, if there is a recipient with an explicitly set amount and the same address is provided as a custom change destination, that sounds like a conflicting instruction to me.",

If we don’t create change, that should be obvious from the excess being smaller than `min_viable_change + change_fee`. Let’s please not use `change_cost` as a dual-intent variable. `change_cost`/`cost_of_change` is the amount that it would cost to create and spend a change _if there is one_. If you want to communicate the intent of not creating change explicitly, please use a separate designated variable that only communicates that and only that.\r\n\r\nIf we can identify the change output, we should remove it before coin selection, redo coin selection with the existing inputs as preset inputs and then create a new change output. The change output should absolutely be part of the waste calculation, since the replacement transaction at a higher feerate may have multiple possible input sets, some of which might be changeless, which then should be preferred by the scoring accordingly.\r\n\r\nGenerally, if a custom change output address is provided, I would read that as “if there will be change, please send it to this”. If the user wants a specific output, they should add it as a recipient. If the user wants a specific output of at least some amount without creating change, they should send a higher amount and subtract the fee from that output, or use a `sendall` with preset inputs. So I don’t see how there should ever be a case of “the user explicitly wanted a specific change”—that would be the description of a recipient output.",

      "body": "No, please don’t do this. This is hacky and muddles meaning of variables.\r\n\r\nThe parameters of creating change are independent of whether change is created or not. In fact, we use some of these value in some of the coinselection algorithms to determine whether we have a changeless solution as well as in transaction building to determine the size of the change output. By fiddling with these values, it feels like we are coding against the implementation of the `GetChange(…)` function rather than against the function definition. Please use a new designated variable to explicitly track that transaction building should not create a change output if we absolutely must have that.\r\n\r\nI would much prefer an approach that sidesteps this entire issue by starting the creation of an RBF transaction higher in the stack where we can remove a pre-existing identifiable change output from the draft transaction before just kicking off an entire transaction building process with some preset inputs.",
