All conflicts should be trivial to solve, in any case.",

          "title": "kernel: Handle fatal errors through return values",
          "body": "Based on #25665.\r\n\r\nCurrently functions issuing fatal errors call the `fatalError` notification method to issue a shutdown procedure. This makes it hard for higher level functions to figure out if an error deeper in the call stack occurred. For users of the kernel it might also be difficult to assert which function call issued a fatal error if they are being run concurrently. If the kernel would eventually be used by external users, getting fatal error information through a callback instead of function return values would also be cumbersome and limiting. Unit, bench, and fuzz tests currently don't have a way to effectively test against fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThis patch set is an attempt to make fatal error handling in the kernel code more transparent. Fatal errors are now passed up the call stack through `util::Result<T, FatalError>` failure values. A previous attempt at this by theuni always immediately returned failure values if a function call returned a failure. However, this is not always desirable (see discussion [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27866#discussion_r1256378064)). Sometimes, further operations can still be completed even if a fatal error was issued. The solution to this is that these \"ignored\" errors are still moved through `util::Result`'s error string values with its `.MoveMessages` method, even while a failure value in the result is not present.\r\n\r\nNext to some smaller behavior changes, the most significant change is that the issuing of a shutdown procedure is delayed until a potential fatal error is handled as opposed to immediately when it is first encountered. Another effect is that potential fatal errors are now asserted in the bench, fuzz and unit tests. Some of the currently not immediately returned fatal errors need some further scrutiny. These are marked with a `TODO (fatal error)` comment and could be tackled in a later PR.\r\n\r\nTo validate this approach a new clang-tidy check is introduced. It implements the following checks:\r\n\r\n1. If a function calls another function with a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` return type, its return type has to be `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` too, or it has to handle the value returned by the function with one of `CheckFatal`, `HandleFatalError`,\r\n`UnwrapFatalError`, or `CheckFatalFailure`.\r\n2. In functions returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` a call to a function returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` needs to propagate the value by either:\r\n   - Returning it immediately\r\n   - Assigning it immediately to an existing result with `.MoveMessages()` or `.Set()`\r\n   - Eventually passing it as an argument to a `.MoveMessages()`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587) and is a step towards stage 2, creating a more refined kernel API.",

          "body": "This PR grabs some interesting bits from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29284 and fixes some edge cases in how block tiebreaks are dealt with.\r\n\r\n## Regarding #29284\r\n\r\nThe main functionality from the PR was dropped given it was not an issue anymore, however, reviewers pointed out some comments were outdated https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29284#discussion_r1522023578 (which to my understanding may have led to thinking that there was still an issue) it also added test coverage for the aforementioned case which was already passing on master and is useful to keep.\r\n\r\n## New functionality\r\n\r\nWhile reviewing the superseded PR, it was noticed that blocks that are loaded from disk may face a similar issue (check https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29284#issuecomment-1994317785 for more context).\r\n\r\nThe issue comes from how tiebreaks for equal work blocks are handled: if two blocks have the same amount of work, the one that is activatable first wins, that is, the one for which we have all its data (and all of its ancestors'). The variable that keeps track of this, within `CBlockIndex` is `nSequenceId`, which is not persisted over restarts. This means that when a node is restarted, all blocks loaded from disk are defaulted the same `nSequenceId`: 0. \r\nNow, when trying to decide what chain is best on loading blocks from disk, the previous tiebreaker rule is not decisive anymore, so the `CBlockIndexWorkComparator` has to default to its last rule: whatever block is loaded first (has a smaller memory address). \r\n\r\nThis means that if multiple same work tip candidates were available before restarting the node, it could be the case that the selected chain tip after restarting does not match the one before.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the way `nSequenceId` is initialized is changed to:\r\n\r\n- 0 for blocks that belong to the previously known best chain\r\n- 1 to all other blocks loaded from disk",

It also gets all helper randomness functions (`randrange`, `fillrand`, ...), making it a lot more succinct to use.\r\n* During tests, **all** randomness is made deterministic (except for `GetStrongRandBytes`) but non-repeating (like `GetRand()` used to be when `g_mock_deterministic_tests` was used), either fixed, or from a random seed (overridden by env var).\r\n* Several infrequently used top-level functions (`GetRandMillis`, `GetRandMicros`, `GetExponentialRand`) are converted into member functions of `FastRandomContext` (and `InsecureRandomContext`).\r\n* `GetRand<T>()` (without argument) can now return the maximum value of the type (previously e.g. `GetRand<uint32_t>()` would never return 0xffffffff).",

          "body": "[An earlier approach](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/1d226ae1f984c5c808f5c24c431b959cdefa692e/) in #28956 involved simplifying and refactoring the network-adjusted time calculation logic, but this was eventually [left out](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28956#issuecomment-1904214370) of the PR to make it easier for reviewers to focus on consensus logic changes.\r\n\r\nSince network-adjusted time is now only used for warning/informational purposes, cleaning up the logic (building on @dergoegge's approach in #28956) should be quite straightforward and uncontroversial. The main changes are:\r\n\r\n- Previously, we would only calculate the time offset from the first 199 outbound peers that we connected to. This limitation is now removed, and we have a proper rolling calculation. I've reduced the set to 50 outbound peers, which seems plenty.\r\n- Previously, we would automatically use the network-adjusted time if the difference was < 70 mins, and warn the user if the difference was larger than that. Since there is no longer any automated time adjustment, I've changed the warning threshold to ~~20~~ 10 minutes (which is an arbitrary number).\r\n- Previously, a warning would only be raised once, and then never again until node restart. This behaviour is now updated to  1) warn to log for every new outbound peer for as long as we appear out of sync, 2) have the RPC warning toggled on/off whenever we go in/out of sync, and 3) have the GUI warn whenever we are out of sync (again), but limited to 1 messagebox per 60 minutes\r\n- no more globals\r\n- remove the `-maxtimeadjustment` startup arg\r\n\r\nCloses #4521",

This poses two potential issues:\r\n\r\n- First, if permanently set (e.g. running with seednode in a config file) we'd be signaling such seed every time we restart our node\r\n- Second, we will be giving the seed node way too much influence over our addrman, populating the latter with data from the former even when unnecessary\r\n\r\nThis changes the behavior to only add seednodes to `m_addr_fetch` if our addrman is empty, or little by little after we've spent some time trying addresses from our addrman. Also, seednodes are added to `m_addr_fetch` in random order, to avoid signaling the same node in case more than one seed is added and we happen to try them over multiple restarts",

          "body": "So far, discouragement of peers triggers when their misbehavior score exceeds 100 points. Most types of misbehavior increment the score by 100, triggering immediate discouragement, but some types do not. This PR makes all increments equal to either 100 (meaning any misbehavior will immediately cause disconnection and discouragement) or 0 (making the behavior effectively unconditionally allowed), and then removes the logic for score accumulation.\r\n\r\nThis simplifies the code a bit, but also makes protocol expectations clearer: if a peer misbehaves, they get disconnected. There is no good reason why certain types of protocol violations should be permitted 4 times (howmuch=20) or 9 times (howmuch=10), while many others are never allowed. Furthermore, the distinction between these looks arbitrary.\r\n\r\nTo assess whether this does not unduly affect existing other software on the network, I've been running this with an additional patch (see https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commits/202403_nomisbehave_log) that adds logging whenever behavior is detected whose misbehavior increment is changed to 100 by this PR. Over the past day I have not seen any instances on my well-connected node (~150 incoming connections), but will continue to monitor.\r\n\r\nThe specific types of misbehavior that are changed to 100 are:\r\n* Sending us a `block` which does not connect to our header tree (which necessarily must have been unsollicited). [used to be score 10]\r\n* Sending us a `headers` with a non-continuous headers sequence. [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 1000 addresses in a single `addr` or `addrv2` message [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 50000 invs in a single `inv` message [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 2000 headers in a single `headers` message [used to be score 20]\r\n\r\nThe specific types of misbehavior that are changed to 0 are:\r\n* Sending us 10 (*) separate BIP130 headers announcements that do not connect to our block tree [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 8 headers in a single `headers` message (which thus does not get treated as a BIP130 announcement) that does not connect to our block tree. [used to be score 10]\r\n\r\nI believe that none of these behaviors are unavoidable, except for the one marked (*) which can in theory happen still due to interaction between BIP130 and variations in system clocks (the max 2 hour in the future rule). This one has been removed entirely. In order to remove the impact of the bug it was designed to deal with, without relying on misbehavior, a separate improvement is included that makes `getheaders`-tracking more accurate.\r\n\r\nIn another unrelated improvement, this also gets rid of the 8 header limit heuristic to determine whether an incoming non-connecting `headers` is a potential BIP130 announcement, as this rule is no longer needed to prevent spurious Misbehavior. Instead, any non-connecting `headers` is now treated as a potential announcement.",

There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #26812\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

          "title": "Broadcast own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections",
          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNext step after this PR is done will be to have the wallet do the private broadcast as well, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11887 would have to be resolved.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

This PR adds support for `std::vector<unsigned char>>`.\r\n\r\nIt also uses `AutoFile` now.\r\n\r\nThis is [update: probably _not_] used in #28983 to store the static key for the Template Provider, in a manner very similar to how we store the Tor v3 and i2p key. However it made no sense to me to store a `CKey` as plain text. See commit \"Persist static key for Template Provider\" for how it's used.\r\n\r\nIt uses a template and leverages the fact that both `std::string` and `std::vector<unsigned char>>` have an `insert()` method that can take a char array.\r\n\r\nThe `unsigned char` support is not used in this PR, but tests do cover it.",

[1]\r\n- Today, a miner can run this with a normal/small maxmempool to get revenue from 1p1c CPFP'd transactions without losing out on the ones with parents below mempool minimum feerate.\r\n- The majority of this code is useful for building more featureful/robust package relay e.g. see the code in #27742.\r\n\r\nThe first 2 commits are followups from #29619:\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29619#discussion_r1523094034\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29619#discussion_r1519819257\r\n\r\nQ: What makes this short of a more full package relay feature?\r\n\r\n(1) it only supports packages in which 1 of the parents needs to be CPFP'd by the child. That includes 1-parent-1-child packages and situations in which the other parents already pay for themselves (and are thus in mempool already when the package is submitted). More general package relay is a future improvement that requires more engineering in mempool and validation - see #27463.\r\n\r\n(2) We rely on having kept the child in orphanage, and don't make any attempt to protect it while we wait to receive the parent. If we are experiencing a lot of orphanage churn (e.g. an adversary is purposefully sending us a lot of transactions with missing inputs), we will fail to submit packages. This limitation has been around for 12+ years, see #27742 which adds a token bucket scheme for protecting package-related orphans at a limited rate per peer.\r\n\r\n(3) Our orphan-handling logic is somewhat opportunistic; we don't make much effort to resolve an orphan beyond asking the child's sender for the parents. This means we may miss packages if the first sender fails to give us the parent (intentionally or unintentionally). To make this more robust, we need receiver-side logic to retry orphan resolution with multiple peers. This is also an existing problem which has a proposed solution in #28031.\r\n\r\n[1]: see this writeup and its links https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/02ec218c7857ef60914e9a3d383b68caf987f70b/bip-0331.mediawiki#propagate-high-feerate-transactions",

          "body": "Looking for conceptual feedback!\r\n\r\nThis is one of two options for how we may embed ASMap files into Bitcoin Core releases. This approach here uses a binary dump of the file which is then committed to the source code as a header file. The alternative approach is not having the data in the source code but only adding it during the build phase of a release. I initially favored the second approach but it seems harder to achieve than I originally expected and I have also started to see the downsides of this approach as well. For example, we would not have the asmap data available in dev builds, meaning those who want to use asmap with dev builds would always need to provide a file as input. Also, opening a PR for new ASMap data before the first RC allows for earlier testing of the data and the PR itself is the natural place where reviewers can give feedback. If the asmap data is only included during the build phase potential problems can only be discovered while testing RC1 and a separate issue would need to be opened to coordinate a fix. I had also not realized that the binary dump header file approach here is very similar to the embedding of the seeds.\r\n\r\nI am still planning to demo how the embedding would work during the build phase, but since I have started to like the approach shown here a lot more lately, I thought I would demo it and hear people's opinions on it.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the binary dump header file could simply be generated using `xxd -i path/to/ip_asn.map init/ip_asn.h`. But I would also be open to adding an equivalent to `makeseeds.py` to make the process more convenient if people would prefer that. ",

On windows these have no effect and the default (`owner`) is used, which corresponds to owner read/write in Unix terms, setting the write access control option on Windows.\r\n\r\nI think this is a pretty helpful (and generally sought-after) change which avoids users having to employ various workarounds.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it also warrants a release note?",

          "body": "Fixes #27744\r\n\r\nSince #27278 we log received headers. For compact blocks we also log which peer sent it (e5ce8576349d404c466b2f4cab1ca7bf920904b2), but not for regular headers. That required an additional refactor, which this PR provides.\r\n\r\nMove the logging from validation to net_processing.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces the number of log entries (under default configuration) per compact block header from 3 to 2: one for the header and one for the connected tip.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces a new helper method `LogBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a _compact block_ we call `LogBlockHeader` from the exact same place as where we previously logged. So that log message doesn't change. What does change is that we no longer _also_ log from `AcceptBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a regular header(s) message, _we only log the last one_. This is a change in behaviour because it was simpler to implement, but it's probably better anyway. It does mean that if a peer sends of a bunch of headers of which _any_ is invalid, we won't log it (here).\r\n\r\nLastly I expanded the code comment explaining why we log this. It initially only covered selfish mining, but we also care about peers sending us headers but not following up (see e.g. #27626).\r\n\r\nExample log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:21Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:23Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223098 tx=848176824 date='2023-06-05T13:11:49Z' progress=1.000000 cache=6.4MiB(54615txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z Saw new cmpctblock header hash=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223112 tx=848179461 date='2023-06-05T13:13:58Z' progress=1.000000 cache=7.2MiB(61275txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:41Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 peer=8\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:42Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 version=0x2db3c000 log2_work=94.223126 tx=848182944 date='2023-06-05T13:14:35Z' progress=1.000000 cache=8.0MiB(69837txo)\r\n```",

With this patch built locally you can test with your own filesystem path (example):\r\n\r\n`tor --SocksPort unix:/Users/matthewzipkin/torsocket/x`\r\n\r\n`bitcoind -proxy=unix:/Users/matthewzipkin/torsocket/x`\r\n\r\nPrep work for this feature includes:\r\n- Moving where and how we create `sockaddr` and `Sock` to accommodate `AF_UNIX` without disturbing `CService`\r\n- Expanding `Proxy` class to represent either a `CService` or a UNIX socket (by its file path)\r\n\r\nFuture work:\r\n- Enable UNIX sockets for ZMQ (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27679)\r\n- Enable UNIX sockets for I2P SAM proxy (some code is included in this PR but not tested or exposed to user options yet)\r\n- Enable UNIX sockets on windows where supported\r\n- Update Network Proxies dialog in GUI to support UNIX sockets\r\n",

This is the most recent time that this peer was the first to notify our node of a new block (one that we didn't already know about), or zero if this peer has never been the first to notify us of a new block. This timestamp already exists internally and is used for stale-tip eviction logic; this PR exposes it at the RPC layer.\r\n\r\nThis PR started out as a suggestion for additional test coverage, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26172#issuecomment-1259678260. It turned out that the easiest way to test (already-merged) #26172 is to add this field to `getpeerinfo` and have a functional test verify its value. But it may also be useful to have this result in its own right, similar to that RPC's existing `last_block` field -- it indicates something about the quality of our peers. It allows one to predict which peer will be evicted when the stale tip logic activates. (I'm not sure if that would be useful, but it may be.)\r\n\r\nThe functional test added here fails without #26172, which is the main goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not test the actual stale-tip eviction logic; that's difficult to do with a functional test. But it does test the correctness of the timestamp that the eviction logic depends on. #23352 is an attempt to test the eviction logic using a unit test, it's not ready to be merged yet. I think having both kinds of tests would be beneficial.",

Not a strong opinion, but I think just mechanically replacing s/LogPrint/LogDebug/ and s/LogPrintf/LogInfo/ everywhere would not provide a major benefit, and while it may be true that \"this will have to be done at some point\" I think the point where it'd be nicest to do this would be after #29256 when we are able to define log sources to make `LogDebug` calls less verbose, and add missing category information to `LogInfo` calls.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't object to this PR if other reviewers think it's a worthwhile improvement and are ok with the long list of conflicts. I just think there are other improvements we should make to log prints besides this one, and it would be better to change each individual log print once instead of changing it multiple times.",

          "body": "This proposes two things:\r\n\r\n1. Make AddrFetch connections to fixed seeds instead of just adding them to AddrMan (suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25678#issuecomment-1210858925)\r\nWhen adding fixed seeds, we currently add them to AddrMan and then make regular full outbound connections to them. If many new nodes use the fixed seeds for this, it will result in them getting a lot of peers requiring IBD, which will create a lot of traffic for them. With an AddrFetch connection, we will only use them to get addresses from other peers and disconnect afterwards.\r\nThis PR proposes to attempt making AddrFetch connections to 10 peers for better diversity (some may be offline anyway). The fixed seeds will still be added to Addrman as before, but only after a delay of 2 minutes, after which they will hopefully no longer be the only entries in AddrMan.\r\n\r\n2. Move the logic of adding fixed seeds out of `ThreadOpenConnections` into `ThreadDNSAddressSeed` (which is being renamed to `ThreadAddressSeed`).\r\nI think this makes sense in general because adding the fixed seeds is in many ways analogous to querying the DNS seeds, and ThreadOpenConnections, which is there to actually open the connections is already quite complex.\r\nAlso, it makes the changes from 1) easier if we don't have to worry about interfering with the automatic connection making logic.\r\n\r\nOne way to test this is to start without `peers.dat` and run with `-nodnsseed -blocksonly -debug=net` and monitor the debug log and `bitcoin-cli -netinfo` behavior.",

Instead of needing to be deferenced twice with `**result` or `(*result)->member`, it only needs to be dereferenced once with `*result` or `result->member`. Also when it is used in a boolean context, instead of evaluating to true when there is no error and the pointer is null, it evaluates to false so it is straightforward to determine whether the result points to something.\r\n\r\nThis PR is only partial a solution to #26004 because while it makes it easier to check for null pointer values, it does not make it impossible to return a null pointer value inside a successful result. It would be possible to enforce that successful results always contain non-null pointers by using a `not_null` type (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24423) in combination with `ResultPtr`, though.\r\n",

          "body": "This adds five new tracepoints with documentation and tests for network connections:\r\n\r\n- established connections with `net:inbound_connection` and `net:outbound_connection`\r\n- closed connections (both closed by us or by the peer) with `net:closed_connnection`\r\n- inbound connections that we choose to evict with `net:evicted_inbound_connection`\r\n- connections that are misbehaving and punished with `net:misbehaving_connection`\r\n\r\nI've been using these tracepoints for a few months now to monitor connection lifetimes, re-connection frequency by IP and netgroup, misbehavior, peer discouragement, and eviction and more. Together with the two existing P2P message tracepoints they allow for a good overview of local P2P network activity. Also sort-of addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22006#discussion_r636775863. \r\n\r\nI've been back and forth on which arguments to include. For example, `net:evicted_connection` could also include some of the eviction metrics like e.g. `last_block_time`, `min_ping_time`, ... but I've left them out for now. If wanted, this can be added here or in a follow-up. I've tried to minimize a potential performance impact by measuring executed instructions with `gdb` where possible (method described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23724#issuecomment-996919963)). I don't think a few hundred extra instructions are too crucial, as connection opens/closes aren't too frequent (compared to e.g. P2P messages).   Note: e.g. `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()` usually executes between 80k and 90k instructions for each new inbound connection.\r\n\r\n| tracepoint                 \t| instructions                                           \t|\r\n|----------------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| net:inbound_connection     \t| 390 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:outbound_connection    \t| between 700 and 1000 ins                                     \t|\r\n| net:closed_connnection     \t| 473 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:evicted_inbound_connection     \t| not measured; likely similar to net:closed_connnection \t|\r\n| net:misbehaving_connection | not measured                                           \t|\r\n\r\nAlso added a bpftrace (tested with v0.14.1) `log_p2p_connections.bt` example script that produces output similar to:\r\n```\r\nAttaching 6 probes...\r\nLogging opened, closed, misbehaving, and evicted P2P connections\r\nOUTBOUND conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, total_out=1\r\nINBOUND conn from 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, total_in=1\r\nMISBEHAVING conn id=1, score_before=0, score_increase=20, message='getdata message size = 50001', threshold_exceeded=false\r\nCLOSED conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, established=1231006505\r\nEVICTED conn to 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, established=1612312312\r\n```",

          "body": "Add `util::Result` support for returning more error information and make use of it in [LoadChainstate method](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665/commits/93af79a1aae9ad483e8ee38ad63f0256464e7153) as an initial application. Followup PR [#25722](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25722) uses it more broadly to return errors and warnings from wallet loading functions as well.\r\n\r\nThis change adds two major features to the result class:\r\n\r\n- For better error handling, adds the ability to return a value on failure, not just a value on success. This is a key missing feature that makes the result class not useful for functions like `LoadChainstate()` which produce different errors that need to be handled differently [^1].\r\n\r\n[^1]: Ability to return error values was actually present in the original implementation of [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218), but unfortunately removed in later iterations.\r\n\r\n- For better error reporting, adds the ability to return warning messages and multiple errors, not just a single error string. This provides a way for functions to report errors and warnings in a standard way, and simplifies interfaces:\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -virtual std::unique_ptr<Wallet> loadWallet(const std::string& name, bilingual_str& error, std::vector<bilingual_str>& warnings) = 0;\r\n    +virtual util::Result<std::unique_ptr<Wallet>> loadWallet(const std::string& name) = 0;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options, DatabaseStatus& status, bilingual_str& error);\r\n    +util::Result<std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase>, DatabaseError> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options);\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThis change also makes some more minor improvements:\r\n\r\n- Smaller type size. `util::Result<int>` is 16 bytes, and `util::Result<void>` is 8 bytes. Previously both were 72 bytes.\r\n\r\n- Broader type compatibility. Supports noncopyable and nonmovable success and error types.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives & design notes\r\n\r\nThe main goal for the `util::Result` class is to provide a standard way for functions to report error and warnings strings. The interface tries to make it easy to provide detailed error feedback to end users, without cluttering code or making it harder to return other result information. There have been multiple iterations of the design using different internal representations and providing different capabilities:\r\n\r\n|   | Representation (approximate)                   | Notes |\r\n|---|------------------------------------------------|-------|\r\n| _1_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Original #25218 implementation in da98fd2efc1a6b9c6e876cf3e227a8c2e9a10827. Good capabilities, but larger type size. Supports error standardized error reporting and customized error handling with failure values. |\r\n| _2_ | `variant<T,bilingual_str>`                | Final #25218 implementation in 7a45c33d1f8a758850cf8e7bd6ad508939ba5c0d. No support for returning failure values so not useful in many cases.\r\n| _3_ | `variant<monostate,T,F>`                 | Pending #25601 implementation that allows choosing whether to use standardized error reporting or return custom failure values, but doesn't support having both at the same time, like approaches _(1)_, _(4)_, _(5)_, _(6)_ do. |\r\n | _4_ | `tuple<variant<T,F>,bilingual_str>`      | Original #25608 implementation in c29d3008de9314dd463ed08e8bff39fe55324498. Basically the same as _(1)_ except it uses separate success and failure types instead of the same type. Using separate success and failure types makes the result class a little less flexible but can help avoid some ambiguity and inconsistent result states. |\r\n| _5_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Final #25608 implementation in dd91f294206ac87b213d23bb76656a0a5f0f4781. Essentially the same as original implementation _(1)_ except has some usability improvements. |\r\n| _6_ | `tuple<T,unique_ptr<tuple<F,bilingual_str>>` | Pending #25665 implementation (this PR). Supports returning failure values, uses separate success and failure types to avoid ambiguity, uses `unique_ptr` to reduce result type size, and avoids heap allocation in the happy path. |\r\n\r\n### Prior discussions & history\r\n\r\n- _furszy_ introduced a `BResult` class providing a standard error reporting mechanism in [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218). It was renamed to `util::Result` in [#25721](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25721) but kept the same representation and capabilities.\r\n\r\n- _MarcoFalke_ suggested using `BResult` for the `LoadChainstate` function in [#25308 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25308#issuecomment-1181674645). Inability to use `BResult` there due to lack of support for failure values led to initial work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _w0xlt_ wrote a `StructuredResult` class in [#25308](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25601) adding the ability to return failure values but sacrificing standard error reporting, which led to more work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _martinus_ suggested a space optimization in [#25608 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608#discussion_r921049409) that also made it easier to support distinct failure & success types, leading to [#25665](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665) as a replacement for [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).",

          "body": "Introduce a generic container that provides a thread-safe access to any object by using a mutex which is acquired every time the object accessed.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nSynced<std::unordered_map<int, int>> m{{3, 9}, {4, 16}};\r\n\r\n{\r\n    SYNCED_LOCK(m, m_locked);\r\n\r\n    // m_locked represents the internal object, i.e. std::unordered_map,\r\n    // while m_locked is in scope the internal mutex is locked.\r\n\r\n    auto it = m_locked->find(3);\r\n    if (it != m_locked->end()) {\r\n        std::cout << it->second << std::endl;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    for (auto& [k, v] : *m_locked) {\r\n        std::cout << k << \", \" << v << std::endl;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nWITH_SYNCED_LOCK(m, p, p->emplace(5, 25));\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemove the global mutexes `g_maplocalhost_mutex`, `g_deadline_timers_mutex`, `cs_dir_locks`, `g_loading_wallet_mutex`, `g_wallet_release_mutex` and use `Synced<T>` instead.\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n_copied from a [comment below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25390#issuecomment-1169788319):_\r\n\r\nThe `Synced<T>` abstraction is similar to what is suggested in [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24931#discussion_r890636987) but it does so in a generic way to avoid code repetition. Its benefit is:\r\n\r\n1. It avoids code repetition at the implementation sites. See [PR#26151](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26151) for a live example. Namely this:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Lots of repetitions (92 lines)</summary>\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nclass Foo\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void PushBack(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.push_back(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Foo::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::vector<int> m_data;\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass Bar\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void PushBack(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.push_back(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Bar::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::vector<std::string> m_data;\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass Baz\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void Insert(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.insert(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Baz::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::set<std::string> m_data;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nbecomes this:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Short (3 lines)</summary>\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nSynced<std::vector<int>> Foo;\r\nSynced<std::vector<std::string>> Bar;\r\nSynced<std::set<std::string>> Baz;\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n2. The mutex is properly encapsulated. With a global mutex and a global variable annotated with `GUARDED_BY()` it is indeed not possible to add new code that accesses the variable without protection (if using Clang and `-Wthread-safety-analysis` and `-Werror`), but it is possible to abuse the mutex and start using it to protect some more, possibly unrelated stuff (we already have this in the current code).\r\n",

(Included in this PR)\r\n* Ensuring pruning doesn't go too far for a desired-functional wallet backup. (Questionable, since you probably lose the node if you need the backup anyway?)\r\n* Allowing users to temporarily disable block indexes and filters, without pruning cutting them off from catching up later.\r\n* Avoiding pruning out from under external wallets (Armory, EPS, etc) that might need block data.\r\n* External block indexes/filters, etc.\r\n\r\nBy design, users retain complete control over prune locks, and can delete them out from under applications using them. This is to avoid circumstances where a prune lock has been set, by an application that may no longer be used.\r\n",

          "body": "This PR lets indexing code mostly run outside of the node process. It also improves indexing sync logic, which is moved out of indexing code to a new [`node::SyncChain()`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/8d8cdcb37005030f646ba3c45f7f54f556efb8bf/src/node/chain.h#L24-L39) function.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the commits in this PR are small refactoring changes that move code from `src/index/` to `src/node/`, or replace references to node types like `CBlockIndex`, `CChain`, `CChainState` in index code. There are only two commits affecting indexing sync logic which make complicated or substantive changes:\r\n\r\n- [`8746b35301c5` indexes: Rewrite chain sync logic, remove racy init](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24230/commits/8746b35301c5f65ff3200555fb2b82417fd2c758)\r\n- [`ad88f50ddd12` indexes: Initialize indexes without holding cs_main](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24230/commits/ad88f50ddd129dddd974bbf9fd7d86ec86b65508)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commit messages have more details about these and other changes. Followups to this PR will reuse indexing sync code for wallets (#15719, #11756) and let indexes run in separate processes (#10102)",

          "body": "Return util::Result objects from all functions that can trigger fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThere are many validation functions that handle failures by calling `AbortNode` and triggering shutdowns, without returning error information to their callers. This makes error handling in libbitcoinkernel application code difficult, because the only way to handle these errors is to register for [notification callbacks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/kernel/notifications_interface.h). Improve this by making all functions that trigger fatal errors return util::Result objects with the error information.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a pure refactoring that returns extra result information from functions without changing their behavior. It's a possible alternative to and subset of #29642, which adds similar return information but also makes behavior changes and exposes a FatalError type.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #25665.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`3ce52fc00a0d` refactor, kernel: Add FlushStatus / FlushResult types](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/3ce52fc00a0d405f006f2e300298ac5e8691546a)\r\n- [`c6bdac1320a2` refactor: Add InfoType field to util::Result](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/c6bdac1320a2de9cd6b4caaa12e5c08e7e7d6723)\r\n- [`e56a36cc7587` refactor, blockstorage: Return FlushResult from flush methods](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/e56a36cc7587610e5dc4cd2a75951b8505c978be)\r\n- [`abd7d3622abc` refactor, blockstorage: Return fatal errors from block writes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/abd7d3622abc3471892549d44432b1a04f10653e)\r\n- [`2c2134443ccf` refactor, blockstorage: Return fatal error from LoadBlockIndex](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/2c2134443ccf2d0b131ce93358c1cfc974f0bbd2)\r\n- [`dceb837707b1` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from FlushStateToDisk](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/dceb837707b1e3b5d6a1a9e8b03a6330b07a79df)\r\n- [`1acf496ebf82` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from mempool accept functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/1acf496ebf821b75d22e1e2de8dd1e254902f8d1)\r\n- [`a39b2cdf4a80` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from assumeutxo snapshot functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/a39b2cdf4a808672b5233f960e881479a0bfad65)\r\n- [`809970373cf5` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from block connect functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/809970373cf53023e79607a9ce8154ce3ac8f330)\r\n- [`901ccdc42910` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from activate best chain functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/901ccdc429105925ed861ab01524c15dce3a6d86)\r\n- [`bbb8fec91d37` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from new block functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/bbb8fec91d37e74bd875ac6c8399cb9c2bee2ea7)\r\n- [`1e29b2eaaff4` refactor, blockstorage: Return fatal error from ImportBlocks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/1e29b2eaaff4b09c0e7db2d5f6d1c4c2147440b6)\r\n- [`f65fa8c91130` refactor, validation: Return more errors from VerifyDB](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/f65fa8c91130931713848a97606d5add0fc9b8c5)",

          "body": "Coupling the fees serialization with CLIENT_VERSION is problematic, because:\r\n\r\n* `CLIENT_VERSION` may change, even though the serialization format does not change. This is harmless, but still confusing.\r\n* If a serialization format change was backported (unlikely), it may lead to incorrect results.\r\n* `CLIENT_VERSION` is changed at a different time during the release process than any serialization format change. This is harmless for releases of Bitcoin Core, but may be confusing when using the development branch.\r\n* It is harder to reason about a global `CLIENT_VERSION` when changing the format, than to reason about a versioning local to the module.\r\n\r\nFix all issues by pinning the current version number in the module locally. In the future it can then be modified locally to the module, if needed.",

If larger, fail.\r\n3) The package rbf may not evict more than 100 transactions from the mempool(bip125 rule 5)\r\n4) The package is a single chunk\r\n5) Every directly conflicted mempool transaction is connected to at most 1 other in-mempool transaction (ie the cluster size of the conflict is at most 2).\r\n6) Diagram check: We ensure that the replacement is strictly superior, improving the mempool\r\n7) The total fee of the package, minus the total fee of what is being evicted, is at least the minrelayfee * size of the package (equivalent to bip125 rule 3 and 4)\r\n\r\nPost-cluster mempool this will likely be expanded to general package rbf, but this is what we can safely support today.\r\n",

          "body": "Improve new LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(),  LogWarning(), LogError() macros introduced in #28318:\r\n\r\n- Make them consistent, now all accepting the same parameters.\r\n- Make them all accept log categories, to make it possible to filter or highlight log messages from a particular component.\r\n- Make them compatible with wallet logging, which includes the wallet name in log messages.\r\n- Make them not rely on a global LogInstance, to provide better control of logging in controlled environments, such as unit tests that want to selectively capture log output, or libbitcoinkernel applications that want to have multiple instances of validation objects without mixing their log output.\r\n- Make them less verbose by not requiring category constants to be specified in individual log prints.\r\n\r\nAn [overview](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0cd1616d47e61e125eb3e573573c0c56fba6b775/src/logging.h#L293-L332) of the macros can be found in the logging header.\r\n\r\n### Problems this PR attempts to solve\r\n\r\nThe new log macros in introduced #28318 are generally great. They allow writing code that is succinct and clear, and make it a lot easier to figure out what log levels are being used. Unfortunately, the new macros are slightly less general than than needed to be used throughout the codebase. Particularly:\r\n\r\n1. The new macros cannot be used conveniently in wallet code because wallet log prints are supposed to automatically attach wallet names to log messages.\r\n2. The new macros cannot be used in libbitcoinkernel code because they do not allow specifying a logger instance.\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, the only alternative approach to solving these problems would be to reimplement these macros outside the logging framework so they could be used by wallet and validation code. This PR just takes the approach of slightly generalizing these macros so they work everywhere.\r\n\r\n### Note to reviewers\r\n\r\nI'd encourage looking at the description and code changes in this PR to evaluate it and try to come an independent judgement before looking at the discussion history. Unfortunately and regrettably, I made some dismissive comments on the previous PR, so the discussion here starts out immediately heated.\r\n\r\nA summary of the disagreement is that ajtowns believes allowing log syntax `LogDebug(m_log, \"debug message\\n\")` is [harmful](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29256#issuecomment-2085586513) if log category is part of the `m_log` argument instead of being an explicit category constant. I think omitting the explicit category constant is not a big deal, cuts down on verbosity and repetition, and allows important features like logging to different instances, and automatically adding other metadata (like wallet filenames) to log messages. Other parts of the discussion refer to earlier versions of the PR, go down various tangents, and make the argument that this PR is unnecessary, not that it is harmful.",

          "title": "contrib: add tool to convert compact-serialized UTXO set to SQLite database",
          "body": "(This PR is currently based on #29612, which should be reviewed first.)\r\n\r\n## Problem description\r\n\r\nThere is demand from users to get the UTXO set in form of a SQLite database (#24628). Bitcoin Core currently only supports dumping the UTXO set in a binary _compact-serialized_ format, which was crafted specifically for AssumeUTXO snapshots (see PR #16899), with the primary goal of being as compact as possible. Previous PRs tried to extend the `dumptxoutset` RPC with new formats, either in human-readable form (e.g. #18689, #24202), or most recently, directly as SQLite database (#24952). Both are not optimal: due to the huge size of the ever-growing UTXO set with already more than 80 million entries on mainnet, human-readable formats are practically useless, and very likely one of the first steps would be to put them in some form of database anyway. Directly adding SQLite3 dumping support on the other hand introduces an additional dependency to the non-wallet part of bitcoind and the risk of increased maintenance burden (see e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1163551060, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24628#issuecomment-1108469715).\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis PR follows the \"external tooling\" route by adding a simple Python script for achieving the same goal in a two-step process (first create compact-serialized UTXO set via `dumptxoutset`, then convert it to SQLite via the new script). Executive summary:\r\n- single file, no extra dependencies (sqlite3 is included in Python's standard library [1])\r\n- ~150 LOC, mostly deserialization/decompression routines ported from the Core codebase and (probably the most difficult part) a little elliptic curve / finite field math to decompress pubkeys (essentialy solving the secp256k1 curve equation y^2 = x^3 + 7 for y given x, respecting the proper polarity as indicated by the compression tag)\r\n- creates a database with only one table `utxos` with the following schema:\r\n  ```(txid TEXT, vout INT, value INT, coinbase INT, height INT, scriptpubkey TEXT)```\r\n- the resulting file has roughly 2x the size of the compact-serialized UTXO set (this is mostly due to encoding txids and scriptpubkeys as hex-strings rather than bytes)\r\n\r\n[1] note that there are some rare cases of operating systems like FreeBSD though, where the sqlite3 module has to installed explicitly (see #26819)\r\n\r\nA functional test is also added that creates UTXO set entries with various output script types (standard and also non-standard, for e.g. large scripts) and verifies that the UTXO sets of both formats match by comparing corresponding MuHashes. One MuHash is supplied by the bitcoind instance via `gettxoutsetinfo muhash`, the other is calculated in the test by reading back the created SQLite database entries and hashing them with the test framework's `MuHash3072` module.\r\n\r\n## Manual test instructions\r\nI'd suggest to do manual tests also by comparing MuHashes. For that, I've written a go tool some time ago which would calculate the MuHash of a sqlite database in the created format (I've tried to do a similar tool in Python, but it's painfully slow).\r\n```\r\n$ [run bitcoind instance with -coinstatsindex]\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli dumptxoutset ~/utxos.dat\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo muhash <block height returned in previous call>\r\n(outputs MuHash calculated from node)\r\n\r\n$ ./contrib/utxo-tools/utxo_to_sqlite.py ~/utxos.dat ~/utxos.sqlite\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/theStack/utxo_dump_tools\r\n$ cd utxo_dump_tools/calc_utxo_hash\r\n$ go run calc_utxo_hash.go ~/utxos.sqlite\r\n(outputs MuHash calculated from the SQLite UTXO set)\r\n\r\n=> verify that both MuHashes are equal\r\n```\r\nFor a demonstration what can be done with the resulting database, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#pullrequestreview-956290477 for some example queries. Thanks go to LarryRuane who gave me to the idea of rewriting this script in Python and adding it to `contrib`.",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [x] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick). [DONE, see [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/research-into-the-effects-of-a-cluster-size-limited-mempool-in-2023/794/1)]\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add duplicate transactions to the mempool (#29990).\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts. Is this a problem?",

          "body": "`SaveBlockToDisk` / `FindBlockPos` are used for two purposes, depending on whether they are called during reindexing (`dbp` set,  `fKnown = true`) or in the \"normal\" case when adding new blocks (`dbp == nullptr`,  `fKnown = false`).\r\nThe actual tasks are quite different\r\n- In normal mode, preparations for saving a new block are made, which is then saved: find the correct position on disk (maybe skipping to a new blk file), check for available disk space, update the blockfile info db, save the block.\r\n- during reindex, most of this is not necessary (the block is already on disk after all), only the blockfile info needs to rebuilt because reindex wiped the leveldb it's saved in.\r\n\r\nUsing one function with many conditional statements for this leads to code that is hard to read / understand and bug-prone:\r\n- many code paths in `FindBlockPos` are conditional on `fKnown` or `!fKnown`\r\n- It's not really clear what actually needs to be done during reindex (we don't need to \"save a block to disk\" or \"find a block pos\" as the function names suggest)\r\n- logic that should be applied to only one of the two modes is sometimes applied to both (see first commit, or #27039)\r\n\r\n#24858 and #27039 were recent bugs directly related to the differences between reindexing and normal mode, and in both cases the simple fix took a long time to be reviewed and merged.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to clean this code up by splitting out the reindex logic into a separate function (`UpdateBlockInfo`) which will be called directly from validation. As a result, `SaveBlockToDisk` and `FindBlockPos` only need to cover the non-reindex logic. ",

          "body": "Part of #27463 in the \"make orphan handling more robust\" section.\r\n\r\nCurrently the main map in `TxOrphanage` is indexed by txid; we do not allow 2 transactions with the same txid into TxOrphanage. This means that if we receive a transaction and want to store it in orphanage, we'll fail to do so if a same-txid-different-witness version of the tx already exists in the orphanage. The existing orphanage entry can stay until it expires 20 minutes later, or until we find that it is invalid.\r\n\r\nThis means an attacker can try to block/delay us accepting an orphan transaction by sending a mutated version of the child ahead of time. See included test.\r\n\r\nPrior to #28970, we don't rely on the orphanage for anything and it would be relatively difficult to guess what transaction will go to a node's orphanage. After the parent(s) are accepted, if anybody sends us the correct transaction, we'll end up accepting it. However, this is a bit more painful for 1p1c: it's easier for an attacker to tell when a tx is going to hit a node's orphanage, and we need to store the correct orphan + receive the parent before we'll consider the package. If we start out with a bad orphan, we can't evict it until we receive the parent + try the 1p1c, and then we'll need to download the real child, put it in orphanage, download the parent again, and then retry 1p1c.",

          "body": "Continues #30005. Closes #17012..\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces NAT-PMP port mapping with its successor PCP (Port Control Protocol) from [RFC6887](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6887).  This adds, in addition to the existing IPv4 port mapping, support for IPv6 pinholing-that is, opening a port on the firewall to make it reachable.\r\n\r\nPCP is a simple UDP-based protocol, and the implementation is self-contained, so this gets rid of lthe libnatpnp dependency without adding a new one. It should otherwise be a drop-in replacement, and as PCP (effectively NATPMP v2) was standardized in 2013, router support shouldn't be any different. \r\n\r\nFor now `-pcp`, like `-natpmp`, is disabled by default, though in the future (not in this PR) we could consider enable it by default to increase the number of connectable nodes without adding significant attack surface.\r\n\r\nTo test:\r\n```bash\r\nbitcoind -regtest -pcp=1 -debug=net\r\n```\r\nThe option `-natpmp` is still accepted as an alias for `-pcp` (but gives a warning).\r\n\r\n(most of the changes in this PR are, ironically, removing the libnatpmp dependency and associated build system and build docs)\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Default gateway discovery on Linux / FreeBSD\r\n- [x] Default gateway discovery on Windows\r\n- [x] Default gateway discovery on MacOS\r\n- [ ] (maybe) split src/util/netif.h off into a separate PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30043#pullrequestreview-2047432934\r\n- [ ] GUI setting migration https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30043#pullrequestreview-2047432934",

As a result, this simplifies the `kernel::Notifications` interface.\r\n- removes warnings.cpp from the kernel library\r\n- removes warning globals\r\n- adds testing for the warning logic\r\n\r\nBehaviour change introduced:\r\n- the `-alertnotify` command is executed for all `KernelNotifications::warningSet` calls, which now also covers the `large-work-invalid-chain` warning\r\n- the GUI is updated automatically whenever a warning is (un)set, covering some code paths where it previously wouldn't be, e.g. when `node::AbortNode()` is called, or for the `large-work-invalid-chain` warning\r\n\r\nSome discussion points:\r\n- is `const std::string& id` the best way to refer to warnings? Enums are an obvious alternative, but since we need to define warnings across libraries, strings seem like a straightforward solution.",
