    "body": "This PR is the wallet API and implementation portion of the GUI PR ( https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/733 ) which is an implementation of the ideas in Paul Sztorc's blog post \"**Deniability - Unilateral Transaction Meta-Privacy**\"(https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/deniability/).\r\n\r\nThe GUI PR has all the details and screenshots of the GUI additions. Here I'll just copy the relevant context for the wallet API changes:\r\n\r\n\"_In short, Paul's idea is to periodically split coins and send them to yourself, making it look like common \"spend\" transactions, such that blockchain ownership analysis becomes more difficult, and thus improving the user's privacy.\r\nWe've implemented this as an additional \"Deniability\" wallet view. The majority of the code is in a new deniabilitydialog.cpp/h source files containing a new DeniabilityDialog class, hooked up to the WalletView class._Â \"\r\n\r\nWhile the Deniability dialog can be implemented entirely with the existing API, adding the core \"deniabilization\" functions to the interfaces::Wallet API allows us to implement the GUI portion with much less code, and more importantly allows us to add RPC support and more thorough unit tests, which is what this PR attempts to do.\r\n\r\nThe main \"deniabilization\" functionality is implemented in spend.cpp/h and feebumper.cpp/h and exposed via the interfaces::Wallet API. \r\nWe've added RPC support via a new RPC call \"walletdeniabilizecoin\". \r\nWe also extended the Wallet tests with coverage for the functionality.\r\n",

      "message": "wallet: Deniability API\n\nThis PR is the wallet API and implementation portion of the GUI PR ( https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/733 ) which is an implementation of the ideas in Paul Sztorc's blog post \"Deniability - Unilateral Transaction Meta-Privacy\"(https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/deniability/).\n\nThe GUI PR has all the details and screenshots of the GUI additions. Here I'll just copy the relevant context for the wallet API changes:\n\n\"\nIn short, Paul's idea is to periodically split coins and send them to yourself, making it look like common \"spend\" transactions, such that blockchain ownership analysis becomes more difficult, and thus improving the user's privacy.\nI've implemented this as an additional \"Deniability\" wallet view. The majority of the code is in a new deniabilitydialog.cpp/h source files containing a new DeniabilityDialog class, hooked up to the WalletView class.Â \n\"\n\nWhile the Deniability dialog can be implemented entirely with the existing API, adding the core \"deniabilization\" functions to the CWallet and interfaces::Wallet API allows us to implement the GUI portion with much less code, and more importantly allows us to add RPC support and more thorough unit tests.",

Bitcoin Core's wallet has a \"unique\" fingerprint on transactions that is shared by way less than 50% of transactions in the network, so creating additional transactions where it is likely (latest when the outputs are spent) that it was a self-transfer seems only to be bloating the utxo set and chain space?

I would assume anyone using the C++/RPC interface understands the implications and can be trusted to know what they are doing.\r\n\r\nThe GUI PR (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/733) implements automation on top of this API, which is also entirely opt-in.

      "body": "Hey @denavila, welcome to Bitcoin Core and thanks for working on this! While I think that this idea could be useful to some extent if implemented correctly, I have a few concerns about the current implementation:\r\n- Currently there is no precaution against a user spending two outputs of a deniabilization transaction together. IMO I think that this is quite problematic and could lead to these deniabilization transactions being rendered ineffective. Not only that, but then it also becomes obvious that a user is trying to deniabilize their funds, which is something that should be avoided.\r\n- As mentioned by @MarcoFalke, currently it is simple to identify Bitcoin Core transactions. Given that the Bitcoin Core wallet does not make up a large portion of on-chain transactions, if a blockchain observer sees that there is a long chain of transactions sending to and receiving from Bitcoin Core wallets, it could become clear that these are deniabilization transactions. \r\n- Additionally, in the current implementation all of the inputs of a deniabilization transaction must share the same address. It is not immediately obvious to me why this was done. This fact, combined with the previous two issues, could make it trivial to identify deniabilization transactions created by BItcoin Core. \r\n\r\nSolving some of these problems could be tricky and might require significantly more code being added to the Bitcoin Core wallet. Given this, Iâm unsure whether it would make sense for an implementation of something like this to be built directly into Bitcoin Core. I'd be curious to hear what others think.",

However, you can look at this explanation from bitcoin privacy wiki to understand basics:\r\n\r\n_\"In a peeling chain, a single address begins with a relatively large amount of bitcoins. A smaller amount is then peeled off this larger amount, creating a transaction in which a small amount is transferred to one address, and the remainder is transferred to a one-time change address. This process is repeated - potentially for hundreds or thousands of hops - until the larger amount is pared down, at which point (in one usage) the amount remaining in the address might be aggregated with other such addresses to again yield a large amount in a single address, and the peeling process begins again[5].\"_\r\n\r\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy",

      "body": "Hi @ishaanam  and thank you for looking at my PR.\r\nI do agree the implementation can be improved and your feedback helps me greatly.\r\n\r\nHere are my thoughts regarding your concerns:\r\n1) I thought about this problem too and indeed spending deniabilized outputs is somewhat challenging. \r\nObviously, if the user just HODLs, or spends less than a deniabilized UTXO, then all is good. \r\nHowever if they spend larger amounts, more than one UTXOs would get picked up and that would reveal that they belong to the same user. \r\nI don't think this destroys the entire privacy gained from deniabilization, since in a regular \"spend\" transaction with no-reuse tag, would look similar to deniabilized transaction, and blockchain analysis would've probably assigned some probability that some UTXOs are change, and our spending would confirm those ... But yes, the larger the spend the more would be revealed, so it's not ideal. \r\nPerhaps we could augment the UTXO selection algorithm to be deniabilization-aware, and perhaps there's ways to pick UTXO that minimize the damage? I'm not sure what heuristic we should use for that, so I'm open to suggestions.\r\nAnother option would be to provide a user parameter for \"likely spendable size\", which we use in the chunking decision and make strictly bigger chunks if possible. There's already logic that avoids \"dust\" chunks so it won't be difficult to extend in that direction.\r\n\r\n2) Yes, the fingerprint concern is valid and unfortunate (and sadly I wasn't aware of it when I started this work). However it's also a pre-existing problem and while I do agree we should fix it, I'm hoping we could do this in a separate PR. Also I'm not yet knowledgable enough to tackle it, so if you guys want me to pursue a solution I could use some help.\r\n\r\n3) The reason for grouping UTXOs that share the same address is that (and correct me if I'm wrong) if we can spend one UTXO from a given address, then we have ownership of all UTXOs that share that address. In other words, we don't lose any privacy by deniabilizing the whole group. \r\nIn my limited experience, large amount of shared-address UTXOs tends to happen when transferring from an exchange (eg periodic buys) - often people don't update their withdrawal address, and many exchanges make it difficult to update (eg by requiring whitelisting and so on).\r\nThis grouping allows the deniabilization process to actually reduce the UTXO count if used for just few cycles.\r\nAt any rate, it would be trivial do disable the grouping if there's a flaw in this reasoning, or otherwise have it on a user toggle or some such.\r\n\r\n> Given this, Iâm unsure whether it would make sense for an implementation of something like this to be built directly into \r\nBitcoin Core\r\n\r\nI thought about if this could be implemented in some kind of a plugin, but as far as I know, there's no support for plugins yet?\r\nOriginally my PR was entirely in the GUI, since I wanted to avoid API changes, but @achow101 correctly pointed out it would be safer and easier to test the main functions as part of the wallet API, so that's why I split the PR into a core and GUI parts.\r\nIf there's a path to implement this in a more \"plugin\" way, I'd be interested to hear of course.\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback. I greatly appreciate it.",

      "body": "> 1. But yes, the larger the spend the more would be revealed, so it's not ideal.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but if you spend a UTXO thatâs the change from the previous transaction with the output of the next, thatâs one thing. But if you spend an output with the change from fifteen transactions prior, you may heavily imply that all payments in between were also self-sends.\r\n\r\n> * Another option would be to provide a user parameter for \"likely spendable size\", which we use in the chunking decision and make strictly bigger chunks if possible. There's already logic that avoids \"dust\" chunks so it won't be difficult to extend in that direction.\r\n\r\nYeah, that sounds like a reasonable direction of development. It would e.g. be possible to pick from two otherwise similar inputs sets the one that creates a change output whose value is most different from other UTXOs already in the wallet. Otherwise, it is a bit difficult to predict what a âlikely spendable sizeâ is, since it depends on many different factors such as future exchange rate, and unknown future motivations for the user to create transactions. I would surmise that past transactions would only have a limited utility in predicting future spending sizes. In fact in my master-thesis, I explored a similar idea by attempting to always create change of a similar amount as the recipient output. Unfortunately, the resulting UTXO pool performed subpar.",
