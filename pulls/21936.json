Should it attempt any other system calls, the kernel will terminate the process with SIGKILL or SIGSYS. In this sense, it does not virtualize the system's resources but isolates the process from them entirely.\r\n>\r\n> […]\r\n> \r\n> seccomp-bpf is an extension to seccomp that allows filtering of system calls using a configurable policy implemented using Berkeley Packet Filter rules. It is used by OpenSSH and vsftpd as well as the Google Chrome/Chromium web browsers on Chrome OS and Linux. (In this regard seccomp-bpf achieves similar functionality, but with more flexibility and higher performance, to the older systrace—which seems to be no longer supported for Linux.)",

That is documented in issue #21466 and being resolved by PR #21756. Review welcome! :)\r\n\r\n> I'm interested in whether there needs to be many more of these kinds of footgun protections in case fuzzing goes down these uncontrolled paths.\r\n\r\nThe bullet proof approach to avoiding unexpected syscalls in Linux is to use [seccomp-bpf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp).\r\n\r\nPR #20487 adds syscall sandbox support to Bitcoin Core using seccomp-bpf (opt-in at compile-time via `--with-syscall-sandbox`), and PR #21538 extends that support to detect use of unexpected syscalls when fuzzing (\"syscall sanitizer\"). Review welcome for both! :)",
