    "title": "fuzz: Left over tmp files when fuzzing with afl++",
    "body": "I frequently run out of disk space when fuzzing our targets with afl++ due to left over tmp files created by our `TestingSetup`s. Similar issues were previously reported (see #22572, #22472).\r\n\r\nThe tmp files are left over when test cases cause timeouts (or crashes) and the afl++ fork-server simply kills the process, leaving it no time to cleanup. Note: this is not a bug in afl++, they specifically advise against creating tmp files in fuzz tests. Increasing the timeout threshold sort of works but it more or less just slows down the disk filling.\r\n\r\n`TestingSetup` should have a memory-only option that results in no disk usage at all.\r\n\r\n* Using a ram disks doesn't work because they would run out of memory\r\n* The fix in #22472 doesn't work when fuzzing on multiple cores",
