    "body": "During migration, `CWalletTx` objects that no longer belong to the migrated wallet are moved to a watchonly wallet. But because the migrated wallet is offline (has null `m_chain`), the `confirmed_block_height` and `conflicting_block_height` values in these transactions are -1. These values need to be updated before they are moved to the watchonly wallet, because the watchonly wallet is online, and remains loaded after the migration is complete. Not updating these values could lead to the watchonly wallet returning incorrect information and potentially triggering assert failures.\r\n\r\nThe problem is only temporary since the height values would be refreshed the next time the watchonly wallet is loaded, but it is worth fixing to avoid unpredictable behavior.\r\n\r\nNoticed while reviewing #28542, and looking for other cases where negative confirmed_block_height and conflicting_block_height values might be used.\r\n\r\nAn easy way to test this bug is to revert the bugfix in the second commit. Then the assert added in the third commit will trigger a crash when `getwalletinfo` is called in [`wallet_migration.py`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c9f288244b8d183e09a917025922b99e3368ef78/test/functional/wallet_migration.py#L250)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",

But because the migrated wallet is\noffline (m_chain == nullptr), the confirmed_block_height and\nconflicting_block_height values in these transactions are -1. These values need\nto be updated before they are moved to the watchonly wallet, because the\nwatchonly wallet is online, and remains loaded after the migration complete.\nNot updating these values could lead to the watchonly wallet returning\nincorrect information and potentially triggering assert failures.\n\nThe problem is only temporary since the height values would be refreshed the\nnext time the watchonly wallet is loaded, but it is worth fixing to avoid\nunpredictable behavior.",

This TXO set is iterated for balance checking and coin selection preparation, which can still be slow for wallets that have had a lot of activity. This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

This is done because mempool-related states are relatively short lived, so it doesn't make sense to serialize them differently than they are on master (mempool-conflicted txs are currently marked as `TxStateInactive`). As a result, this PR only changes how these transaction are dealt with in memory.\r\n\r\nIn memory `TxStateConflicted` (which only refers to block conflicts) and `TxStateMempoolConflicted` are treated the same, which results in `IsSpent` returning false for an output being spent by a mempool conflicted transaction where it previously returned true.\r\n\r\nA transaction is marked as `TxStateMempoolConflicted` during `transactionAddedToMempool` where any transactions that conflict with the one just added to the mempool are marked as mempool-conflicted if they are not already block conflicted.\r\n\r\nA transaction is unmarked `TxStateMempoolConflicted` when the conflicting transaction is removed from the mempool for any reason other than it being added to a block (because in this case it will later be marked as block-conflicted anyways).\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a `mempoolconflicts` field to the `gettransaction` wallet RPC result.\r\n\r\nBuilds on #27145\r\nSecond attempt at #18600",

Would be happy to review a PR if you have an idea of how to implement that. (Feel free to take any changes from this PR if they'd be useful. Or we could fix the bug directly with this PR and then make the change the loading in a later PR.)",

We already do this for a wallet when it is migrated, but we do not for the new watchonly and solvables wallets that may be created. This PR introduces this behavior, in addition to creating those wallets initially without an attached chain.\r\n\r\nWhile implementing this, I noticed that not all `CWalletTx` metadata was being copied over to the watchonly wallet and so some data, such as time received, was being lost. This PR fixes this as a side effect of not having a chain attached to the watchonly wallet. A test has also been added.",
