          "body": "Add additional Clang thread safety analysis annotations as discussed with @sipa (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10866#issuecomment-316238630) and others.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to #10866 ~~which this PR is rebased upon (awaiting merge of #10866). The first three commits (8a1dc09, e022990 and cbae151) can be reviewed in #10866.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR contains three types of changes:\r\n1. Add missing locks (based on the `GUARDED_BY(...)` analysis below). Please review thoroughly.\r\n2. Add `GUARDED_BY(...)` annotations to allow for Clang's thread safety analysis at compile-time. Does not change run-time behaviour.\r\n3. Add `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(...)` annotations to allow for Clang's thread safety analysis at compile-time. Does not change run-time behaviour.\r\n\r\nBackground reading: The [\"C/C++ Thread Safety Analysis\"](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/42958.pdf) paper (Hutchins, Ballman & Sutherland, 2014) paper describing Clang thread safety analysis and how it is used for the Google C++ codebase:\r\n\r\n> They essentially provide a static type system for threads, and can detect potential race conditions and deadlocks. This paper describes Clang Thread Safety Analysis, a tool which uses annotations to declare and enforce thread safety policies in C and C++ programs.\r\n> […]\r\n> It has been deployed on a large scale at Google; all C++ code at Google is now compiled with thread safety analysis enabled by default.\r\n> […]\r\n> The `GUARDED_BY` attribute declares that a thread must lock `mu` before it can read or write to `balance`, thus ensuring that the increment and decrement operations are atomic. Similarly, `REQUIRES` declares that the calling thread must lock mu before calling `withdrawImpl`. Because the caller is assumed to have locked `mu,` it is safe to modify `balance` within the body of the method.",

It doesn't make sense to have more than 1 iteration per eval, because the speed per coin as part of a large flush is a more relevant metric then how often you can flush 1 coin. At the same time I didn't want the benches to use up too much  RAM if someone sets `-scaling` to high number.\r\n\r\nTo test a bigger cache increase `N_CACHE_SCALE=1`. The cache is about 40 MB by default, try `N_CACHE_SCALE=100` for more realistic scenarios, but note that test needs ~3x RAM.\r\n\r\nI'm doing a few things the bench framework doesn't seem designed for. Would like some feedback before I refactor it in the wrong direction:\r\n\r\n- [ ] share code with test framework (should support `--disable-test`?)\r\n- [ ] clean up stuff between evals; e.g. I need to reset the coin cache for `CCoinsViewCacheAddCoinFresh` and `CCoinsViewCacheFlush`\r\n- [ ] disable scaling iterations\r\n- [ ] add a memory-scaling argument\r\n- [ ] allow pausing the clock between iterations; e.g. to generate test coins on the fly rather in bulk before the run ",

          "body": "`p2p_segwit.py` is a very long test, composed of multiple subtests. When it fails it's difficult to debug for a couple of reasons:\r\n\r\n- Control flow jumps between different methods in the test class, so it's a little difficult to follow the code.\r\n- state may be carried forward unintentionally from one subtest to the next.\r\n\r\nImprove that by wrapping the subtests with a `@subtest` decorator which:\r\n- logs progress\r\n- asserts state after each subtest\r\n\r\nAs usual, I've also included a few commits which generally tidy up the test and improve style.",

It matches any single character that sorts between the two characters, inclusive, using the locale's collating sequence and character set. For example, in the default C locale, `[a-d]` is equivalent to `[abcd]`. Many  locales sort characters in dictionary order, and in these locales `[a-d]` is typically not equivalent to `[abcd]`; it might be equivalent to `[aBbCcDd]`, for example. To obtain the traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the C locale by setting the `LC_ALL` environment variable to the value C.\r\n\r\nContext: [Locale issue found when reviewing #13450](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13450/files#r194877736)\r\n",

This should neuter the attack entirely.\r\n\r\nThe negative is that a header-only processed block/future syncing mode would cause this to fail until the node has imported the data required.\r\n\r\nrelated: #13451 \r\n\r\n`importprunedfunds` needs this check as well. Can expand it to cover this if people like the idea.",

This moves the include to the cpp file and uses a forward declaration in the header.\r\n\r\nLocally this speeds up the incremental build (building everything that uses the ui module) with gcc by ~5% for me. Gcc uses ~5% less memory.\r\n\r\nWould be nice if someone could verify the numbers roughly.\r\n\r\nI presume the improvements will be more pronounced if the other models would stop exposing the boost header as well.",

          "body": "After PR #13033 and PR #13243 there is a useful framework to add more indexes other than txindex, however circular dependencies detected by lint (`index/txindex -> validation -> index/txindex` and `index/txindex -> index/base -> validation -> index/txindex`) would prevent such solution to pass CI checks without adding an exception rule in check scrypt. In case one calls newly added index method in `validation.cpp`, another circular dependency is created because new index is supposed to inherit from index/base. My proposition is to split `validation.cpp` into two parts, one with its core features / functionalities and other with utils used in other translation units that require including `validation`. No functional change in code is expected here as it is only moved between files, and a circular dependency is removed.",

          "body": "This implements a layer around an immutable tx pool. The layer can be seen as a temporary throw-away shell that provides the same interface as `CTxMemPool`. Its primary purpose right now is to be passed into ATMP while testing acceptance of several (potentially depending) transaction and then to be discarded.\r\n\r\nOne use case could be to determine if smart contracts that are set up with multiple txs would be accepted by current consensus and policy rules.\r\n\r\nIn the future it could be extended to support recursive wrapping of layers or a way to commit changes that happened in the layer to the underlying pool or layer. Furthermore, it could be extended to be revivable after changes to the underlying layer happened. (As opposed to be single-use)",

Additionally, because SRD uses effective values, the previous fee increasing loop thing is now removed and effective value is used everywhere.\r\n\r\nSome tests may fail spuriously because they may rely on semi-deterministic behavior from the original coin selection algorithm. I have been able to fix the ones that fail the most, but others may still have issues. Please let me know if you see any tests fail for coin selection reasons (e.g. insufficient funds, missing inputs, etc.) and I will try to fix them.\r\n\r\nI will be working on doing simulations this week and will post the data once I finish them.",

This leaves the next 64 (or 56 depending if final chunk) open for data. In the case of the script execution cache, this does not make a big performance improvement because the nonce was already properly padded to fit into one buffer, but does make the code a little simpler. In the case of the sig cache, this should reduce the hashing overhead slightly because we are less likely to need an additional processing step.\r\n\r\nI haven't benchmarked this, but back of the envelope it should reduce the hashing by one buffer for all combinations except compressed public keys with compact signatures.",

          "body": "This PR is the last in a chain of PRs (#14437, #14711, and #15288) that make the wallet code access node state through an abstract [`Chain`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/wipc-sep/src/interfaces/chain.h) class in [`src/interfaces/`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/wipc-sep/src/interfaces) instead of using global variables like `cs_main`, `chainActive`, and `g_connman`. After this PR, wallet code no longer accesses global variables declared outside the wallet directory, and no longer calls functions accessing those globals (as verified by the `hide-globals` script in #10244).\r\n\r\nThis PR and the previous PRs have been refactoring changes that do not affect behavior. Previous PRs have consisted of lots of mechanical changes like:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    wtx.nTimeReceived = GetAdjustedTime();\r\n+    wtx.nTimeReceived = m_chain->getAdjustedTime();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is smaller, but less mechanical. It replaces last few bits of wallet code that access node state directly (through `CValidationInterface`, `CRPCTable`, and `CCoinsViewMemPool` interfaces) with code that uses the `Chain` interface.\r\n\r\nThese changes allow followup PR #10102 (multiprocess gui & wallet PR) to work without any significant updates to wallet code. Additionally they:\r\n\r\n* Provide a single place to describe the interface between wallet and node code.\r\n* Can make better wallet testing possible, because the `Chain` object consists of virtual methods that can be overloaded for mocking. (This could be used to test edge cases in the rescan code, for example).",

After this refactoring, the bumpfee PR could call AddToWallet safely instead of implementing a duplicate AddToWallet function.\r\n\r\nThis also allows getting rid of the CWalletTx copy constructor to prevent unintentional copying.",

See [doc/design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/design/multiprocess.md) for usage details and future plans.\r\n\r\nThe change is implemented by adding a new [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that spawns new wallet and node subprocesses that can be controlled over a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) by calling [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/node.h), [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/wallet.h), and [`ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/chain.h) methods. When running with split processes, you can see the IPC messages going back and forth in `-debug=1` output. Followup PR's #19460 and #19461 add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\r\n\r\nThe IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/ipc/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSlides from a presentation describing this change are available on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).\r\n",
