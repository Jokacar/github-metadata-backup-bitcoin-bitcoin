    "title": "Don't assume signature grinding for external signers",
    "body": "Since #13666 our fee calculation assumes that ECSDA signatures are a maximum of 71 bytes, rather than 72. However, not all hardware wallets implement R-value grinding.\r\n\r\nThis can cause us to underpay fees when using an external signer. That's especially problematic when the user picks 1 sat/vbyte as the fee, because it won't even get into our own mempool.\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution would be to modify `ExternalSignerScriptPubKeyMan` to assume 72 bytes for ECSDA signatures.\r\n\r\nSlightly more advanced would be to expand HWI to keep track of which devices and firmware versions (if any) support R-value grinding. We'd then have to store that in the wallet in some new field. Personally I'd rather work on better Taproot support, which thanks to Schnorr avoids this issue altogether. ",

          "body": "When producing a dummy signature for the purpose of estimating the transaction fee, do not assume an external signer performs R-value grinding on the signature.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this avoids a scenario where the fee rate is 1 sat / vbyte and a transaction with a 72 byte signature is not accepted into our mempool.\r\n\r\nSuggested testing:\r\n1. On master, launch with `-signet` and create an external signer wallet using e.g. a Trezor and HWI, see [guide](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/external-signer.md#example-usage) (with the GUI it should \"just work\" once you have the HWI path configured).\r\n2. Create a few addresses and fund them from the faucet: https://signet.bc-2.jp/ (wait for confirmation)\r\n3. Create another address, and now send the entire wallet to it, set the fee to 1 sat/byte\r\n4. Most likely this transaction never gets broadcast and you won't see it on the [signet explorer](https://explorer.bc-2.jp) \r\n\r\n5. With this PR, try again.\r\n6. Check the explorer and inspect the transaction. Each input witness starts with either `30440220` (R has 32 bytes) or `30440221` (R has 33 bytes). See this explainer for [DER encoding](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/92680/what-are-the-der-signature-and-sec-format).\r\n\r\nFixes #26030 ",
