    "title": "Bitcoin puzzles in lower ranges (starting with 66 as of now) can't be cashed out because of bots and RBF",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nAs you might know, there is this bitcoin puzzle thing going on with the 66th at 10% and the prime candidate to be solved next. It's guaranteed to be solved within 2-3 years if I'm not mistaken.\r\n\r\nIt appears that whoever solves this puzzle first has no way to cash out because as soon as an outgoing transaction is published the public key of the wallet is revealed meaning that a great number of bots monitoring the 66th puzzle wallet pick up the public key, find out the private key within seconds using kangaroo or bsgs and repost the transaction with RBF using higher fee to essentially steal original finder's funds.\r\n\r\nIt is above all unfair.\r\n\r\nCan anything be done about it? The immediate solution that comes to mind is that RBF should be allowed only with the same wallet destination. \n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
