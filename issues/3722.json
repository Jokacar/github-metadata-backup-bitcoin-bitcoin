    "body": "Sparked by another discussion (#3721), it seemed useful to open an issue on transaction expiration.\n\nIt has been my longstanding contention that transaction lifetimes should be more deterministic. If a transaction does not confirm within a set period, the mempool should forget it, rather than accumulating garbage and leaving the transaction in limbo.\n\nOne proposal bandied about on IRC is to expire any transaction from the memory pool, that does not confirm within X blocks.  Proposed value for X is 2 days, 144*2.\n\nIt is always the responsibility of the client to retransmit a transaction until it is confirmed.  If a client ceases retransmission, and waits X blocks, they have a reasonable chance of presuming the network has forgotten the transaction [assuming the network has mostly upgraded]. That enables the client to recover the dead transaction, including double-spending with a higher fee.\n\nThis seems to accomplish two useful goals:  preventing the mempool from accumulating garbage, and making transaction lifetime more deterministic [within a certain probability].\n\nRelated: mempool superblock redesign (#3723).\n",

      "body": "One thing I've wondered about this is if its possible to avoid an expiration replacement race.\n\nSay 2 days minus one second after your tx is originally broadcast, you rebroadcast: your peers still have it so it goes nowhere and your broadcast has no effect.  Say it's 2 days plus one second: some nodes still have it and so the broadcast is not very effective... and your transaction still falls out of memory pools.\n\nThis all creates a window where an aggressively broadcasting double-spender could replace the transaction in memory pools.  \n\nObviously double-spend exclusion can't be counted on, and perhaps will someday be mooted by a more greedy miner policy,   but I think it would be unfortunate to weaken the exclusion as a side effect of this if it can be avoided.\n",

This super-block is sorted according to default bitcoind block-building rules: fee per kB, with a little area for under-fee (zero fee) high priority transactions.  Any newly arriving transaction is either (a) added to the memory pool, possibly triggering removal of other transactions, or (b) dropped and not relayed.\n\nThis would seem to deal with spam dynamically, as transactions would drop off the low end of the superblock.  This also effectively caps the size of the memory pool, reducing DoS attack surface.  And, it plays into transaction lifetime work (#3722).\n",

      "body": "> This all creates a window where an aggressively broadcasting double-spender could replace the transaction in memory pools.\n\nSo the idea here is:\n- Attacker creates a deliberately low fee transaction (t1) paying himself, broadcasts it to merchant node (they in turn relay to the entire network).\n- Original transaction (t1) falls out of merchant's mempool.\n- Attacker double-spends that original transaction (t1), but this time with a transaction (t2) paying the merchant, and sends it to the merchant node.\n- Broadcast of t2 mostly fails, because the rest of the network still has t1 in their mempools.\n- Attacker waits a few more seconds (or more, time isn't critical for this step if the previous steps failed), t1 is dropped from most nodes.\n- Attacker broadcasts t3, which pays him (double-spend of both t1 and t2).\n\nThe simplest countermeasure I can think of is to have a longer expiration time for transactions if you're running a merchant node (so you never accept a tx before your peers would relay it), but I think the attacker can still juggle broadcasts to merchant/rest of network to get their mempools out of sync (just requires more steps), unless the merchant mempool's expiration time is effectively infinite.\n\nI don't think there's a reject-doublespend peer message in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3185, but if there were (or if the first doublespend relaying code was deployed), wouldn't that let the merchant node know there's a problem?\n\nThat way it can try broadcasting t2 and very quickly spot the double spend conflict between t1 and t2.\n",
