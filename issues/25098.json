    "title": "Adding a minimally-patched Guix repo to the org",
    "body": "As of e6a94d44469f90f4dc88a07a5a8587730811c705, we use Guix's upstream git repo on https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git for our `guix time-machine`-powered pinning.\r\n\r\nHowever, it does seem that we occasionally will encounter problems with Guix's upstream repo which are not easily fixed using the Guix package transformation flags.\r\n\r\nIn particular:\r\n\r\n1. A test of `gnutls` failed because of a chronological error whereby a certificate used in a test expired. (#21203)\r\n    - We waited until Guix v1.3.0 was released to bump our `time-machine` to a Guix with a newer version of `gnutls` that had the test fixed.\r\n2. A test of `libgit2` failed because of a chronological error whereby a test relied on relative time calculations from the present, which needed to be bumped every year (#25082)\r\n\r\n> /me shakes fist at upstream packages writing tests that depend on the current time\r\n\r\nBoth of these problems are in packages that \"underpin Guix\", which means that\r\n\r\n1. It is in the best interest of Guix (and its users) to keep testing these packages instead of turning off tests entirely\r\n2. They are not subject to the Guix package transformation flags. (`--without-tests=blah`, etc.)\r\n3. Changes to these packages will cause a mass-rebuild of almost all of Guix's packages, so these changes will be in Guix's \"core-updates\" branch for a while before hitting master (see the [Guix Manual section on Submitting Patches](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Submitting-Patches)).\r\n\r\nI think the better way might be to just maintain our own fork of Guix, that is minimally patched compared to upstream, so that we have more flexibility when deploying fixes like these and not have to wait for upstream (Guix or the actual package itself) to take our patches, go through their branching process, and hit Guix master.\r\n\r\nWhat do people think? @fanquake @hebasto @laanwj \r\n",

          "body": "This (I believe) resolves the last of the blockers for [switching us away from cctools and instead using out-of-the-box llvm and lld](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21778) for building Darwin binaries.\r\n\r\nFor now, we continue building with a pre-packaged llvm and cctools, but after this PR the clang+lld combo should just work for anyone trying it. Additionally after this PR, the new runtime `fixup_chains` behavior will be in-use, as ld64 uses it as well.\r\n\r\nThe commits may seem unrelated, so in detail:\r\n\r\nlld (llvm's linker) has been a work-in-progress for Darwin for years. Recently though, it has gained nearly all of the features we require. The last missing feature from ld64, `-Wl,-bind_at_load`, is not implemented in lld; as far as I can tell [lazy loading has conceptually been replaced by fixup chains](https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/iOS15LaunchTime).\r\n\r\nSo that means we don't need ld64's `bind_at_load` as long as lld can handle `-Wl,-fixup_chains` (which it can). I've added it to our configure as a linker option mostly so that we can see it in the logs; it's default-on as long as the minimum version is >11.0.\r\n\r\nAbout that: the runtime functionality required for `-Wl,-fixup_chains` [requires macOS >=11.0](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/16.x/lld/MachO/Driver.cpp#L1021). Hence the commit that bumps the minimum version. Our current min runtime of `10.15` has been unsupported since September 2022, so I don't expect this bump to be controversial.\r\n\r\nLastly, with the minimum runtime version bumped to 11.0, our current version of pre-compiled clang we use for macOS is too old to understand `-mmacosx-version-min=11.0` because it expects `=10.x`. So I've made the smallest possible bump (from 10.0.1 to 11.1.0) to a version that understands. This bump is arbitrary and unfortunate, but likely to be short-lived as we may end up replacing it with llvm+lld for v26 anyway. I've held off on bumping the SDK as I think that makes sense to do as part of the lld switch instead.",

The diff is large but the change itself is quite small.\r\n\r\nFixes builds with llvm >= 11 in guix by working around the problem. As a bonus, this is much cleaner and more maintainable than what we had before.\r\n\r\nSee the updated comment for more info. At a high level: rather than playing tricks and trying to work around clang's default includes, disable them and re-add what we want.",
