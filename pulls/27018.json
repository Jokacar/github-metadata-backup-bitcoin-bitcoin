    "body": "This was suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933#issuecomment-1412320818.\r\n\r\n**The Problem**\r\nPackage CPFP (only accessible through regtest-only RPC submitpackage) allows 0-fee (or otherwise below min relay feerate) transactions if they are bumped by a child. We need to know what to do with these transactions if they lose their sponsor, e.g. due to a replacement that removed the input spending this 0-fee transaction.\r\n\r\nThis is made slightly more complicated by the fact that our \"selection scoring\" (BlockAssembler) is different from our \"eviction scoring.\" Roughly, we select based on ancestor feerate and evict based on descendant feerate. This may lead to [evicting things we would actually want to mine](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27018#issuecomment-1424742766) and [not evicting things that we will never mine](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933#issuecomment-1400143991).\r\n\r\nThis PR's approach is to remove the 1sat/vB `-blockmintxfee` and have BlockAssembler select anything in the mempool (still based on ancestor packages, but not stopping at 1sat/vB). It also adds logic to `TrimToSize()` to evict anything paying <=0 fees. The idea is, if we're getting to the bottom of our mempool, we scrape up all the sats we can. Anything that pays *some* fee is worth adding to the block template.\r\n\r\nA major advantage of this approach is that 0-fee, non-v3 transactions can be bumped in package CPFP.\r\n\r\nA few observations which may or may not be problematic:\r\n- This increases the potential work after a reorg, since we add an extra step of removing the below-minrelayfeerate entries.\r\n- This increases the number of transactions that may be evicted in a replacement (from the worst case scenario we discussed before, it's up to 2500 entries).\r\n- This means you can remove a transaction from your own mempool by calling prioritisetransaction with a negative value.\r\n",

In practice, `ApplyArgsManOptions()` is never called in such a way that this leads to observed behaviour change. Regardless, I've carved out the potential behaviour change into a separate commit and would be okay with dropping it, should it turn out to be controversial.",

          "title": "mempool: disallow txns under min relay fee, even in packages",
          "body": "Part of package relay, see #27463.\r\n\r\nNote that this still allows packages to bump transactions that are below the dynamic mempool minimum feerate, which means this still solves the \"mempool is congested and my presigned 1sat/vB tx is screwed\" problem for all transactions.\r\n\r\nOn master, the package policy (only accessible through regtest-only RPC submitpackage) allows 0-fee (or otherwise below min relay feerate) transactions if they are bumped by a child. However, with default package limits, we don't yet have a DoS-resistant way of ensuring these transactions remain bumped throughout their time in the mempool. Primarily, the fee-bumping child may later be replaced by another transaction that doesn't bump the parent(s). The parent(s) could potentially stay bumped by other transactions, but not enough to ever be selected by the `BlockAssembler` (due to `blockmintxfee`).\r\n\r\nFor example, (tested [here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/commits/26933-motivation)):\r\n- The mempool accepts 24 below-minrelayfeerate transactions (\"0-fee parents\"), all bumped by a single high-fee transaction (\"the fee-bumping child\"). The fee-bumping child also spends a confirmed UTXO.\r\n- Two additional children are added to each 0-fee parent. These children each pay a feerate slightly above the minimum relay feerate (e.g. 1.9sat/vB) such that, for each 0-fee parent, the total fees of its two children divided by the total size of the children and parent is above the minimum relay feerate.\r\n- If a block template is built now, all transactions would be selected.\r\n- A transaction replaces the the fee-bumping child, spending only the confirmed UTXO and not any of the outputs from the 0-fee parents.\r\n - The 0-fee parents now each have 2 children. Their descendant feerates are above minrelayfeerate, which means that they remain in the mempool, even if the mempool evicts all below-minrelayfeerate packages.\r\n - If a block template is built now, none of the 0-fee parents or their children would be selected.\r\n - Even more low-feerate descendants can be added to these below-minrelayfeerate packages and they will not be evicted until they expire or the mempool reaches capacity.\r\n\r\nUnless we have a DoS-resistant way of ensuring package CPFP-bumped transactions are always bumped, allowing package CPFP to bump below-minrelayfeerate transactions can result in these problematic situations. See #27018 which proposes a partial solution with some limitations, and contains discussion about potential improvements to eviction strategy. While no adequate solution exists, for now, avoid these situations by requiring all transactions to meet min relay feerate.",

If the children are evicted, and the parents no longer bumped, they will be below min relay feerate.\r\n- A replacement transaction spends only confirmed UTXOs. This means it has 100 directly conflicting transactions (the 100 children). There are no descendants, so there are 100 original transactions in total. But accepting the replacement transaction actually invalidates not 100, but 100 * 25 = 2500 mempool transactions.\r\n- We can remove these transactions in TrimToSize(), but 2500 is considerably more than our previous limit of 100.\r\n\r\nA counterargument is that we don't currently have any guarantees that we never `TrimToSize()` more than 2500 entries at a time. We also don't have a good idea of how computationally expensive this really is. For example, it's possible that accepting a large, high-feerate transaction when the mempool is almost full causes just as many evictions. In general, when traffic is high, mempool churn is probably high as well.",

      "body": "I guess another similar question is whether we care about the potential reorg handling slowdown. One scenario is a reorg adding below-minrelayfeerate transactions back to mempool, which we then spend time flushing through `TrimToSize()` (I suppose this is bounded by `MAX_DISCONNECTED_TX_POOL_SIZE` and the fact that it's extremely expensive to mine a bunch of free txns so that other people's reorg processing slows down). During this time, we can't build the next block template. Previously, we basically held off on flushing until the next tx was submitted, and blockmintxfee prevented low-feerate things getting into the template. I'm not sure how long this takes, will have to benchmark.",

      "body": "Adding a trim-under-min-relay directly in `ActivateBestChainStep()` to evict 0-fee parent dangling in the mempool on an observable oracle like block propagation could break some assumptions for chain of transactions, especially if they're coming from multiple spenders. If you assume a collaborative transaction like the dual-funding specified by BOLTs, where the collaborative transaction can be RBF'ed, an old low-federate transaction could be broadcast with a high-federate package, and if this CPFP replaced, stale the opening of the dual-funded channel. I think an improvement could be at least to make the oracle hard to predict from a spying node (and if so we should probably add a filter to prevent 0-fee evicted probing with `GETDATA`).\r\n\r\nTransaction processing not being computationally cheap has already been raised in the context of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21224 As of today, I think we would like to ensure second-layers can broadcast significant quantity of pre-signed transactions in a short period of time (e.g a LSP doing splicing with all its spokes to rebalance channels because network mempools are empty), without interferences with our current DoS limits like `MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS`. Or if second-layers nodes should deploy multiple \"transaction-relay\" entry points (e.g connect to multiple full-nodes) to do some kind of initial broadcast load-balancing, that something to be thought of, I believe (and if we should modify our transaction-broadcast backend there). I think we would like to be careful to not introduce exploitable synchronicity issues, e.g in the case of massive redeployment of channel types for Lightning (e.g upgrade from anchor outputs to Taproot outputs on the commitment transaction format), see comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038#issuecomment-1405944407\r\n",

The flushing logic only effects things that can't even be relayed on today's network, assuming no one is touching minrelayfeerate defaults?\r\n\r\nI did some basic benchmarking here on eviction, showing that on my machine at least it takes ~0.3s to evict a \"worst case\" scenario. Do note that it also takes roughly the same amount of time to even build up the mempool, and that's without any script checks. So in some sense it at least isn't obviously the wrong thing to do from a CPU exhaustion perspective. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933#issuecomment-1413841878\r\n\r\nOne sanity benchmark I didn't run is the speed of the benchmark if only the child transaction of each package is evicted. I suspect it would be quick, but probably should double check.\r\n\r\nThis PR seems to be simpler from a mental model perspective, at the cost of some additional CPU cycles. It would also allow non-V3 transactions to have more reasonable specs.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933 Seems to be more complex from a mental model perspective, but may be more protective of CPU cycles in certain scenarios with non-privileged mempool usage.\r\n\r\n> One scenario is a reorg adding below-minrelayfeerate transactions back to mempool\r\n\r\nI'd consider this roughly equivalent to a mempool user paying to put things in the mempool, then evicting them in terms of attack cost.

      "body": "I am still wrapping my head around how best to think about this, but a few things come to mind:\r\n\r\n1) Yes perhaps we should improve the way mempool limiting works in general, so that we either (a) automatically resubmit descendant subpackages that would be eligible for mempool acceptance due to sufficient feerate whenever they get trimmed out of the mempool due to eviction of a parent, or better (b) avoid evicting those subpackages in the first place.  \r\n\r\n2) The example I posted shows that it is possible for there to be transactions in the mempool that cannot be mined at a feerate >= minrelayfeerate, but cannot be detected as such by looking only at descendant scores (this is demonstrated if you only considered transactions B, C and E in the example I posted above).  Looking at ancestor scores is also insufficient for making this determination (as mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933#issuecomment-1416713975). This would seem to imply that we would need to do something substantially more complicated in order to prevent a situation where, after package validation is deployed, that a miner might mine a block containing a package at a feerate below the minrelayfeerate.\r\n\r\nThinking about (2), perhaps we should split our concerns about low-feerate transactions/packages in the mempool into what I think are the two components: (a) anti-DoS and (b) maximizing miner income.\r\n\r\nFor (a) anti-DoS, I don't believe there is a DoS concern if we both mine everything in the mempool and only encounter this situation due to these RBF scenarios where no free relay is going on.  So really the concern is just (b), how do we ensure that a miner is never worse off for including some transactions that are in the mempool.\r\n\r\nWe could just try to cut out the most obvious problems -- transactions that are literally 0-fee to the miner.  If we restrict the allowed topologies for package validation, we may be able to do better than that, but I don't know if that's a direction we want to go down.  @ajtowns' idea in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933 may work as well, but I'm wondering how we can generalize our thinking of what we're trying to specifically achieve?",

          "body": "See #27463 for overall project tracking.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 2 projects: v3 policy and package RBF. Mailing list posts: [package RBF 1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019464.html) and [V3 + package RBF 2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html). It stems from a long discussion about RBF pinning, across a [mailing list thread](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html) and [gist](https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff).\r\n\r\nV3 Policy: A set of policy rules applied to transactions with their `nVersion` field set to 3. Namely, it allows users to opt in to more restrictive descendant limits for shared transactions. If adopted by many nodes in the network, V3 mitigates various RBF pinning attacks. See doc/policy/version3_transactions.md for the exact rules and rationale, and [these review club notes](bitcoincore.reviews/25038) for more background and discussion. A short-term benefit of V3 is effective \"cluster limit\" of 2 which makes it very cheap to calculate the mining score of a v3 transaction.\r\n\r\nPackage RBF: In addition to allowing a child to pay for its parents within the package, also allow the child to pay for replacing the parent's conflicts. For example, this allows LN users to replace commitment transactions existing in the mempool, simply by broadcasting their respective commitment transactions with a high-fee child. The commitment transactions can be signed with 0 fees, which means no overpaying. This PR allows for package RBF with v3 packages.",

There are multiple options:\r\n   - Don't ever allow v1 and v2 txs below minrelaytxfee (#26933)\r\n   - Mine everything that makes it into in the mempool (default blockmintxfee to 0).

Even without package relay, we can run into this problem if we are shrinking -maxmempool or raising -minrelaytxfee on a restart.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nWhen loading mempool.dat, use `bypass_limits=true` and then call `TrimToSize()` at the very end.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n- We definitely keep the \"highest descendant score\" transactions if mempool min feerate rises.\r\n- It's extremely simple implementation-wise.\r\n- It's simple to keep track of what made it in and what didn't.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages:\r\n- If mempool.dat is very large, we can exceed maxmempool by quite a bit.\r\n- This won't be sufficient for ephemeral anchors (unless `bypass_limits` allows not-yet-spent anchors).\r\n",

You can just drop the blockminfee commit from this PR, and it seems fine, no?\r\n\r\nThe only result of setting `-blockminfee` is that if its value is higher than `-minrelaytxfee` you'll potentially never empty your own memory even if you're the only miner and no new transactions are being created/relayed. That's undesirable as default behaviour, but seems okay if you deliberately choose it. (And the mempool will empty eventually anyway, as a result of expiry)",

      "body": "> From the ephemeral anchors review club:\r\n\r\n>>    `<glozow> ok hm. i kinda need to get rid of blockmintxfee for pakcage relay tho`\r\n\r\n> Can you elaborate on that?\r\n\r\nMy thinking there was that we needed to address this DoS issue in order to proceed with package relay, and this PR seemed like the most likely approach (hence the \"kinda\"). Now, maybe #26933 seems more likely?\r\n\r\n>  You can just drop the blockminfee commit from this PR, and it seems fine, no?\r\n> The only result of setting -blockminfee is that if its value is higher than -minrelaytxfee you'll potentially never empty your own memory even if you're the only miner and no new transactions are being created/relayed.\r\n\r\nI don't think the problem is only when blockmintxfee > minrelaytxfee. With this PR, if both are 1sat/vB, you can have (all transactions same size):\r\n1. parent (paying 1 satoshi in fees) + fee-bumping child accepted to mempool as a package\r\n2. attach 2 more children to the parent, each 1.5sat/vB\r\n3. replace the child with something not bumping the parent. The parent is not removed because its descendant score > 1sat/vB\r\n4. parent is also never selected in BlockAssembler because the 2 children's ancestor scores are < 1sat/vB.\r\n\r\nThis works even if we have a significantly lower blockmintxfee (e.g. 0.6sat/vB) while minrelaytxfee = 1sat/vB. We can still get to an equivalent state, just with more children. N children with feerate (N+1)/N keeps the descendant score above 1sat/vB while the ancestor scores are lower than blockmintxfee.\r\n\r\n> (Would support changing the default to 0sat/vb though)\r\n\r\nYeah, I think this would work.",
