    "body": "I am new to coding and blockchain. I have 2 private keys starting with K and L which are 52 characters and the address corresponding to these keys saved as screenshot when they were created using Electrum years back but when i try to convert these address to the actual address it keeps giving a different address, also tried to import the keys to a new wallet it keeps generating wrong bitcoin addresses. what could be the issue and is there a python script to generate the correct address? any help will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nI have tried multiple scripts found on forums but nothing works but I can confirm the address and its keys are correct without any missing characters and they belong to an actual bitcoin address",
