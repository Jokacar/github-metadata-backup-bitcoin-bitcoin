    "title": "Faster way to get block with prevouts in JSON-RPC",
    "body": "I often need to process the whole blockchain (or a large part of it) using an external script/program, for which I need blocks with prevout information included. However, the only current way to get that is `getblock <hash> 3`, which includes a lot of potentially unnecessary data and is quite slow, mainly (based on my experiments) because of `UniValue` overhead and descriptor inferring.\r\n\r\nI benchmarked current master, retrieving 1000 blocks sequentially starting at block 840000, with different `verbosity` parameters:\r\n\r\n|benchmark|result|\r\n|-|-|\r\n|getblock (verbosity=0)|16.189s ± 1.165s|\r\n|getblock (verbosity=1)|31.975s ± 1.014s|\r\n|getblock (verbosity=2)|352.487s ± 1.636s|\r\n|getblock (verbosity=3)|473.375s ± 2.280s|\r\n\r\nAs you can see, verbosity=3 is around 30 times slower than verbosity=0. It seems obvious that a faster way of getting blocks with prevout information is feasible.\r\n\r\nPotential solutions that come to mind:\r\n- Creating a new RPC call for undo data, say `getblockundo`. This would be perfect for my needs, but it would require making the undo data serialization format non-internal (not sure if this would be a problem, as IIRC it hasn't changed in many years).\r\n- Creating a new verbosity level for `getblock` that would only provide the minimum amount of data necessary (i.e. no addresses, descriptors, ASM scripts, TXIDs/WTXIDs etc.) while still providing prevouts. This would be better than nothing but would still leave a lot of performance on the table because of `UniValue` overhead.",
