    "title": "Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative",
    "body": "It would be nice if there was a way to tell core to only broadcast transactions over Tor, but use clearnet for everything else.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell the only way to guarantee transaction broadcast over Tor is to use onlynet=onion, which means that all network traffic goes over Tor. The problem is that this introduces latency for blocks/confirmations and transactions. Some users might only want to use Tor to try to protect \"first broadcast\" transaction origin analysis which can be a problem with sybil attacking clearnet nodes. This can still be a problem on Tor as well, but can be more difficult to pull off.\r\n\r\nSome bitcoin software such as wasabi and joinmarket already implement this by establishing a new Tor circuit, broadcasting the transaction, and then disconnecting. Perhaps bitcoin could do this as well?\r\n\r\nSome things that were brought up when I mentioned this on IRC by @naumenkogs, @luke-jr  and others:\r\n\r\nFor the resistance to first-broadcast analysis to be effective, the node should treat the transaction as if it wasn't theirs to begin with. I'm not familiar with the network code, so I'm not sure if anything would have to change relay policy-wise.\r\n\r\nWould be happy to hear other thoughts on what would be required to implement this, or if there's something I'm missing, as it's something I would be interested in implementing if there are enough concept acks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR rationale:\r\n\r\n- A nodes wants to recieve blocks/confirmations/transactions as soon as possible with the lowest latency\r\n\r\n- A node wants increased broadcast privacy without paying the full cost of onlynet=tor latency\r\n",

      "body": "> For the resistance to first-broadcast analysis to be effective, the node should treat the transaction as if it wasn't theirs to begin with. I'm not familiar with the network code, so I'm not sure if anything would have to change relay policy-wise.\r\n\r\nI think the general idea is that you should consider your mempool to be an open book to all your inbound and outbound peers. So adding a wallet transaction to the mempool, which is readable by all your clearnet peers, and then sending the transaction on tor only will make it more than trivial for all clearnet peers to mark all your wallet transactions. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15668#issuecomment-476738512 .\r\n\r\nSo I think one solution would be to never put the transaction in the mempool, but have logic in the wallet to create a one-shot connection to spit out the tx and immediately disconnect. Obviously your peer will learn your network fingerprint (version message), as well as your wallet tx (tx message). Though, with a connection over tor, and a normalized version message this should be conceptually OK.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I haven't drafted an implementation yet is because the wallet can't keep track of non-mempool change. See #11887. And fixing that appears non-trivial at first glance.",

          "body": "Rationale: Bitcoin Core can broadcast transactions over tor, but a full node connected via both i2p and clearnet broadcasts transactions over both so doesn't protect well against IP correlation. Currently few wallets support tor broadcasting within the wallet. Except for Electrum Personal Server, electrum servers don't support tor broadcasting, and EPS as the name suggests is not fit for a public electrum server.\r\n\r\nThus, an modern Electrum server fit for public use that supports broadcasting transactions over tor could increase transaction privacy for many users.",

This increases privacy and will also make it harder to perform fingerprinting attacks (connecting our identities over different networks).\r\n\r\nManual Block-Relay connections:\r\n- can be specified with `-addnode` RPC, both with the `add` and `onetry` command\r\n- can be specified with the `-addnode` bitcoind arg (or in bitcoin.conf) with `<IP>=manual-block-relay`\r\n- don't participate in transaction and address relay\r\n- don't get discouraged / punished for misbehavior (but will still get disconnected for sending TX/tx-INV as automatic block-relay-only peers do)\r\n- are not subject to outbound eviction logic (unlike automatic block-relay-only-peers)\r\n",

          "body": "To improve privacy, relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for relaying sensitive data (our own transactions) with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local unbroadcast transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer and the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed\r\n\r\n* Relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers.\r\n\r\n* Hide those transactions from `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` requests, as if we don't have them.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, request the transaction with `GETDATA`, as if we didn't have it before.\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the unbroadcast list.\r\n\r\n* `INV` it to others as a result of the `TX` message we get, like what we do with transactions that are not ours.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new local transaction is received (from the wallet or RPC), the node will send it to 5 (`SENSITIVE_RELAY_NUM_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 5 more peers (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptInitialBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived sensitive relay connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers will blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [x] Disable if `-connect` is used or Tor and I2P are not reachable.\r\n* [x] Use I2P transient connections even if listening on I2P.\r\n* [x] Do something with the user-agent string (could reveal identity if it has been personalized) and make sure no identifying information in the `VERSION` message. Done: took the [suggestion below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#issuecomment-1517896418).\r\n* [x] Improve the condition when we consider the transaction seen by the network: right now a single INV from somebody suffices (this is still an improvement over `master` which is ok right after pushing the tx to a peer). We could wait for more than one INV, from peers that we have selected (outbound) and that are specifically not the ones we broadcasted to (via short-lived connection). Edit: One `INV` should be enough because after that we broadcast the transaction to everybody we are connected to (like if it is not ours).\r\n* [ ] Idea: start with one connection per transaction (not 5 as it is now), optimistically assuming it will be sufficient. (numbers are examples) After 1 minute, if still not received from the network, try 2 connections, after a few minutes try more. If still unsuccessful after 10 minutes, then fall back to the old mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to address:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450\r\n",
