I have tried the fix mentioned in this thread without luck.   I do however, have a backup of the wallet.  Could it be worth nuking litecoin on my computer and trying to load the backup? \r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/losh11/2d4ee89cdb4965bec4c2128cbc579e31\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\n0.21.3\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nWindows 10 19045.4780\n\n### Machine specifications\n\nGood specs just default install pathway is on a 480GB SSD so space ran out.
