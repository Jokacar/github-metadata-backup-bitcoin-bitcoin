    "title": "`blockfilterindex` Extensibility Proposal",
    "body": "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14121 implemented `blockfilterindex` in a way that it is extensible to different filter types, however there is only one single filter type so far, which is the default one, and combinations of these filter types aren't possible. In this proposal I describe how it is possible to add other filter types in a way that it is (1) backwards compatible and (2) all possible combinations of different filter types are possible.\r\n\r\n### Having Different Filters In Parallel\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand the code it is already prepared and adding a new filter type does not require refactoring to achieve this. So one would be able to define\r\n\r\n```\r\nblockfilterindex=basic\r\nblockfilterindex=p2wpkh\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the software will create both of those filters in parallel.\r\n\r\n### Combinations of Filters\r\n\r\n`blockfilterindex=basic`'s value maps to `uint8_t` values: 0 and 1. We can also represent `uint8_t` with a byte array that holds 8 octets. In case of `basic` it would be `00000000` (0) or `00000001` (1).  \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9156103/75546298-8680c880-5a28-11ea-9880-b19b7d50a4ed.png)\r\n\r\nThe idea is to use the bytes to denote the next filter types. For example we can assign `00000010` (2) to `p2wpkh` and `00000100` (4) to `p2wsh`. Further as the need arises we can use a larger type `uint32_t` or something like that to be able to define larger number of types.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9156103/75546336-98fb0200-5a28-11ea-8b99-6e0542f9cb32.png)\r\n\r\nBut why not just go `1,2,3,4,5...` instead? Because this would enable us to also specify filter combinations. For example if I specify 6 (`00000110`) then I see that the `p2wpkh` and `p2wsh` octets are both flipped to true, so the software would add both to the filter:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9156103/75546383-af08c280-5a28-11ea-8c38-4167f310ba51.png)\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// If blockfilterindex  is turned on.\r\nforeach (var script in scripts) {\r\n\r\n    if (no higher octets are flipped to true other than the basic filter type's) {\r\n        filter.Add(script);\r\n        continue;\r\n    }\r\n    // However for backwards compatibility if a higher octet is true then disregard the basic filter type's octet since currently both 0 and 1 are defined to be the basic octet type. This will result two numbers evaluating to the same combination (Alternatively config parsing can throw an error or whatever to disable one of the number.)\r\n\r\n    if (p2wpkh octet is true AND script is p2wpkh) {\r\n        filter.Add(script);\r\n        continue;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (p2wsh octet is true AND script is p2wsh) {\r\n        filter.Add(script);\r\n        continue;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Add other types\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Not In a Hurry\r\n\r\nLuckily whoever would add the next filter type wouldn't need to consider this proposal at all, because the next filter type would be `2` anyway, which lets us delay the decision until the 3rd filter type is added, of which according to this proposal should hold the value of `4` instead of `3` in order to facilitate the combinations of filter types.",

          "title": "Add `blockfilterindex = p2wpkh` ",
          "body": "I would like to have a `p2wpkh` `blockfilterindex` type to outsource Wasabi's filter generation to Bitcoin Core, as our filter generation is orders of magnitude slower and we would like to bring this to the client side too, so our users with full nodes would be able to validate that our server does not cheat.  \r\n\r\nI previously created a `blockfilterindex` extensibility proposal to enable filter type combinations: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18221. So the followup PR of this issue will make sure it adheres to it. Since the PR is ready already, I'll omit to go into the implementation details in this issue, rather concentrate on the goal, the benefits of end users and how we ruled out the alternative solutions.\r\n\r\n### The Goal\r\n\r\nWe would like to enable our users to upgrade Wasabi to be a full node with one click.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9156103/75548208-01e47900-5a2d-11ea-9f5a-87b7d6099a47.png)\r\n\r\nThis feature is already implemented and rolled out to production (shipping with Core, fee estimation, tx broadcasting, mempool serving etc..) except the (most important) validation part of it is yet to be added.\r\n\r\n### Alternative Solutions\r\n\r\nI've been long struggling with how to enable this for our users and we ended up working together with a brilliant dev, @dangershony, who maintained the C# Bitcoin full node for years. Unfortunately we had to rule out all the possible alternatives.  \r\n\r\nOne alternative would be using `importmulti`, but we would not like to rely on the wallet feature of Bitcoin Core, rather stick to the node functionality.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative could be to slowly replace our filters with Bitcoin Core's filters on the client side, but that would require reindexing all of our wallets, which in some cases could take half a day. Also mixing filter types feels dirty and can result in unexpected issues.\r\n\r\nWe also considered bringing our own filter generation algorithm to the client side, but this is one of the oldest brain class of our codebase that serves a critical functionality so touching this could be problematic. It currently takes 2-3 days for us to create our filters on a powerful server, even though we are using `p2wpkh` filters and only building them from segwit activation. Bitcoin Core creates these filters within 2 hours. Why we are so slow is out of the scope of this issue, but here's the clue: input scripts aren't part of a transaction.\r\n\r\nFurther we considered just blindly going through all the blocks and process all the transactions and make sure the server doesn't lie. The performance here is also unacceptable.\r\n\r\nFinally we would also don't like to use bloom filters, as it is on the edge of obsolation and having multiple filters to achieve the same purpose feels dirty from a complexity point of view.\r\n\r\n### Benefits to the End User\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell has suggested to articulate the benefits to the end user for changes to the codebase, thus this section.\r\n\r\nAdding new filter types and filter type combinations (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18221) would enable a privacy oriented light wallet surge to be built on top of Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nMaybe more importantly Bitcoin Core providing the filters to Wasabi enables a clean architecture and a seamless UX for users willing to run a full node that comes with Wasabi.\r\n\r\nIt is quite unique in a sense that no other popular light wallets went to the extent of building a full node into their software, especially not in a way that only requires a a single click configuration, so if our feature gets out of \"work in progress\" phase there may be an influx of full node users, which is good for the network.\r\n\r\nWhat we stand to lose is that this full node feature will be delayed into the future so far that I may not be here when the next clean solution presents itself and maybe the Wasabi team won't be willing to work on it as frankly it has little business value.\r\n\r\n### What's Next?\r\n\r\nThis issue described our motivation and the context of the feature request, our pull request is coming up soon, so we discuss the specifics.",
