    "body": "When fetching inputs in ConnectBlock, each input is fetched from the cache in series. A cache miss means a round trip to the disk db to fetch the outpoint and insert it into the cache. Since the db is locked from being written during ConnectTip, we can fetch all block inputs missing from the cache on parallel threads before entering ConnectBlock. Using this strategy resulted in a ~17% faster IBD (or master was ~21% slower).\r\n\r\nDoing IBD with 16 vcores from a local peer with default settings, stopping at height 850k:\r\n\r\n|  | Mean [s] | Min [s] | Max [s] | Relative |\r\n|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|\r\n| branch | 22187.488 ± 50.159 | 22152.021 | 22222.956 | 1.00 |\r\n| master | 26865.884 ± 33.498 | 26842.197 | 26889.570 | 1.21 |\r\n\r\n\r\nThis approach is heavily inspired by `CCheckQueue`, but we could not easily reuse it since it only checks for validity and doesn't allow us to store results in a queue. So, this PR creates a new `InputFetcher` that loops through all inputs of a block on the main thread and adds their outpoints to a queue to be fetched in parallel. Worker threads pull outpoints from the queue and fetch them from the db, and then push the results back onto another queue. Once the main thread has finished looping through the block inputs, it pulls results from the result queue and inserts them into the cache.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses number of cores to create the worker threads, but since the work on the threads is IO bound, it might benefit from using a multiple of the number of cores. However, that would result in more memory usage and lock contention, so the optimal number is still unknown.",

So, they could share workers.\r\n\r\nThis should be benchmarked because it might add some overhead but, #26966 introduces such structure inside 401f21bfd72f32a28147677af542887518a4dbff, which we could pull off and use for validation.",

I guess that with requests of such a small size to such a fast storage, you need to submit really many of them to keep the SSD busy.\r\n\r\nIf we can provide a benchmark for this usecase we can likely find an optimal multiplier here - I won't nack but this part is very important for me.",

      "body": "> coroutines are just programming paradigm, not magic\r\n\r\nThat's also what I was counting on! :D\r\n\r\nIn RocksDB they have [high and low priority work](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/RocksDB-Tuning-Guide#parallelism-options) (I assume that's just added to the front or the back of a background work deque) – this could align well with @furszy's suggestion for mixing different kinds of background work units.\r\n\r\nI haven't used the C++ variant of coroutines either, but my thinking was that since they can theoretically yield execution when waiting for IO (and resume later), this would allow threads to focus on other tasks in the meantime. Combined with an appropriate scheduling mechanism (such as a thread pool), we could maximize both CPU and IO usage, if I'm not mistaken.\r\nInstead of each thread handling just one task, it could suspend a coroutine while waiting on IO (e.g., a database fetch) and resume it later, effectively maximizing CPU and IO work without needing to know the exact details of the work.\r\n\r\n> If the vectors are thread local\r\n\r\nThe vector would still be global, but each thread would only access a single bucket (i.e. global vector of vectors, with each thread from the pool writing only to `vector[thread_id]`, which contains a vector of fetched coins).\r\nWhen all the work is finished, we'd iterate over the global vector and merge the results into the cache on a single thread.\r\nAs mentioned, sorting the outpoints before fetching could help improve data locality and reduce lock contention, and the coroutines above would help with work stealing, ensuring that all threads finish roughly at the same time.\r\n\r\nIs there anything prohibiting us from doing something like this to minimize synchronization and lock contention during the fetch phase? I understand some synchronization would still be needed during the merge, but this could help reduce global locks and unnecessary synchronization throughout the process.\r\n",
