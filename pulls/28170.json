    "body": "Derived from #28120 discussion.\r\n\r\nBy relocating the peer desirable services flags into the peer manager, we\r\nallow the connections acceptance process to handle post-IBD potential\r\nstalling scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe peer manager will be able to dynamically adjust the services flags\r\nbased on the node's proximity to the tip (back and forth). Allowing the node\r\nto recover from the following post-IBD scenario:\r\nSuppose the node has successfully synced the chain, but later experienced\r\ndropped connections and remained inactive for a duration longer than the limited\r\npeers threshold (the timeframe within which limited peers can provide blocks). In\r\nsuch cases, upon reconnecting to the network, the node might only establish\r\nconnections with limited peers, filling up all available outbound slots. Resulting\r\nin an inability to synchronize the chain (because limited peers will not provide\r\nblocks older than the `NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED_MIN_BLOCKS` threshold).\r\n\r\nAlso, with this update, the node will avoid initiating extra block-relay-only\r\nconnections during such stalling scenarios. Prioritizing syncing to latest tip.",

          "body": "To improve privacy, relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for relaying sensitive data (our own transactions) with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local unbroadcast transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer and the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed\r\n\r\n* Relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers.\r\n\r\n* Hide those transactions from `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` requests, as if we don't have them.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, request the transaction with `GETDATA`, as if we didn't have it before.\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the unbroadcast list.\r\n\r\n* `INV` it to others as a result of the `TX` message we get, like what we do with transactions that are not ours.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new local transaction is received (from the wallet or RPC), the node will send it to 5 (`SENSITIVE_RELAY_NUM_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 5 more peers (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptInitialBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived sensitive relay connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers will blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [x] Disable if `-connect` is used or Tor and I2P are not reachable.\r\n* [x] Use I2P transient connections even if listening on I2P.\r\n* [x] Do something with the user-agent string (could reveal identity if it has been personalized) and make sure no identifying information in the `VERSION` message. Done: took the [suggestion below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#issuecomment-1517896418).\r\n* [x] Improve the condition when we consider the transaction seen by the network: right now a single INV from somebody suffices (this is still an improvement over `master` which is ok right after pushing the tx to a peer). We could wait for more than one INV, from peers that we have selected (outbound) and that are specifically not the ones we broadcasted to (via short-lived connection). Edit: One `INV` should be enough because after that we broadcast the transaction to everybody we are connected to (like if it is not ours).\r\n* [ ] Idea: start with one connection per transaction (not 5 as it is now), optimistically assuming it will be sufficient. (numbers are examples) After 1 minute, if still not received from the network, try 2 connections, after a few minutes try more. If still unsuccessful after 10 minutes, then fall back to the old mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to address:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450\r\n",

This is not completely true for the inbound eviction logic as it exists as static functions in `net.{h.cpp}` for which tests already exist. However, the outbound eviction logic is not covered by any fuzz tests and is only testable by spinning up both a connman and peerman.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits out the eviction logic into its own component `EvictionManager`. In addition to isolating the eviction logic, we get rid of several layer violations (e.g. `CConnman::ForEachNode/ForNode` calls, `CNode::m_last_block_time`, etc.) between `net` and `net processing`.\r\n\r\nOne instance of the `EvictionManager` is created at start up and passed as a reference to the connection and peer managers. The connection and peer managers report all eviction relevant information to the eviction manager who ultimately suggests nodes to evict as the result of `EvictionManager::SelectInboundNodeToEvict` and `EvictionManager::SelectOutboundNodesToEvict`.",

The IBD flag is set to true but never reverted for the entire software lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThe scenario that I described in the PR description is a real scenario. Reproducible by running #28120 test case. Which exercises the proposed behavior.\r\n\r\nBasically, same as the IBD flag, `g_initial_block_download_completed` is set to true but never reverted. Which ends up with the node always connecting to limited peers after the first IBD completion. Not accounting for prolonged stalling situations, where the node is beyond the limited peers threshold due an internet outage.\r\n\r\nTo test the behavior, you could drop the bug fix commit from that branch. Will see the post-IBD super stalled node connecting to a limited peer even when such peer is not helpful, as it will not provide any of the historical blocks required to sync-up the node.",

      "body": "Have thought more about this and I'm not so convinced anymore.\r\n\r\nThe connection manager class lives on a lower level, and manages only a fraction of the node's information. And this field is strictly linked to the node's overall status. Right now, `HasDesirableServiceFlags()` requires to know the chain sync status.\r\nSo, by placing it inside `CConMan`, we add another level of indirection. Because, most of the time, the peer manager class will call to the `CConMan` setter and subsequently call the getter to utilize it. Using the `CConMan` class mostly as a field container.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would complicate any expansion of the peer services selectivity logic because different processes would require to update the flag stored in `CConMan`. For instance, the node could be seeking to exclusively connect to peers that provide block filters (up to a certain point, then pick other preferences on a case basis), or could want to minimize the number of limited connections based on the chain download state, or if a chain stale state was detected, or could be needing to disallow certain peer types for a certain time etc.\r\n\r\nConsidering this, the responsibility for managing this field seems to fit better inside the peer manager class.\r\n\r\nHappy to hear your thoughts about this. Will keep thinking about it, I think that we can still improve this to not require `cs_main` lock even if it's placed inside the peers manager class.",
