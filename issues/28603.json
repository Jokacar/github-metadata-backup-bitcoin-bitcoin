    "body": "### Motivation\r\n\r\n`feature_init.py` is a functional test that perturbs various files in the data directory (simulation data corruption), and checks the response during startup.\r\n\r\nRecently, this test was improved in #27823, but there were some open suggestions in, in particular https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27823#discussion_r1267289758, to extend and/or randomize the way files are perturbed.\r\n\r\nThere is also the possibility that more sophisticated perturbations could potentially uncover other unhandled exceptions/assert crashes like the one fixed in #27823.  \r\n\r\n### Possible solution\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Useful Skills\r\n\r\n* Python\r\n* Debugging the bitcoin core C++ file parsing code in order to understand why certain perturbation lead to certain errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Guidance for new contributors\r\n\r\nWant to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",

Fixed by first opening for read, then for write.\r\n* We need to restore the previous state after perturbations, so that only the current perturbation is active and not a mix of the current and previous ones.\r\n* I also added `checkblocks=200` to the startup parameters so that corruption in earlier blocks of `blk00000.dat` is detected during init verification and not ignored.\r\n\r\nAfter fixing `feature_init.py` like that I'd run into the `assert` mentioned above (so running the testfix from the second commit without the first one is a way to reproduce it).",
