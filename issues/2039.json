      "body": "I was just looking at this. The fix introduced by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24858 gets us very close to being able to allow read only blk files that are already finalized. This only makes sense with **finalized** block files as blk files that have logical space under the 128 MiB limit need to be writable for appending additional blocks. Even with the #24858 fix, `BlockManager::FlushBlockFile` still tries to open the finalized block file for writing. But, I don't think it would be very difficult to keep track in `BlockManager::FindBlockPos` via the `m_blockfile_info[nFile]` to know if the current blk file has been appended. We'd have to add another data member to track if any new blocks have been appended to the blockfile. If it hasn't been appended, then we could accept the blk flush failing as it was not changed, and the failure was caused by not being able to open it for writing.\r\n\r\nFor reference, I tested current master branch functionality and got the following while using only a single finalized blk00000.dat (fe4b764e0ce523cfce6d9e4f326e0d0977ee317a51b4a129cda707cfa4699dd7  blocks/blk00000.dat):\r\n```\r\nUnable to open file /tmp/btc/blocks/blk00000.dat\r\nERROR: Flush: failed to open file 0\r\n*** Flushing block file to disk failed.

This PR skips flushing to disk those blocks that already have a known position in the datastore. Skipping this means that users can write-protect the `blk` files on disk which may be useful for security or even safely sharing that data between multiple bitcoind instances.\r\n\r\n`FindBlockPos()` may also flush the undo data file, but again this is skipped if the corresponding block position is known, like during the initial stage of a reindex when block data is being indexed. Once the block index is complete the validation mechanism will call `ConnectBlock()` which will save undo data at that time.\r\n\r\nThe call stack looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninit()\r\nThreadImport() <-- process fReindex flag\r\nLoadExternalBlockFile()\r\nAcceptBlock()\r\nSaveBlockToDisk()\r\nFindBlockPos()\r\nFlushBlockFile() <-- unnecessary if block is already on disk\r\n```\r\n\r\nA larger refactor of this part of the code was started by mzumsande here:  https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/tree/202207_refactor_findblockpos including this fix, reviewers can let me know if the changes should be combined.\r\n",
