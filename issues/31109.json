    "title": "Mining Interface doesn't allow for Bitcoin Core to create blocks when it wants",
    "body": "Finally getting around to reviewing the mining interface, and sadly its missing some critical features that a new mining protocol should have. Specifically, one of the key goals of replacing `getblocktemplate` is that Bitcoin Core should be able to push work to clients at opportune times. This includes the ability to create a new block in between validating a new block and updating the mempool for a full CNB run. Sadly, forcing the client of the interface to explicitly call CNB makes this impossible.",

      "body": "> But aren't we holding cs_main throughout the process?\r\n\r\nDoesn't mean we can't build a new block. There's several ways we might build a new block here - (a) we might precalculate an oversized next-next-block in advance and just walk through and quickly remove conflicts to get us mining on a non-empty template as fast as possible, (b) we might delay updating the mempool entirely waiting on new block building - if we're mining the most important thing is the new work (and relay might work without delay sometimes anyway thanks to HB compact blocks), (c) we might just build new work immediately after updating the mempool in the same `cs_main` lock to avoid letting anything else take the lock before we get a chance to, etc.\r\n\r\nThe point is the protocol should support this, Bitcoin Core certainly doesn't have to do anything with it yet, but if the protocol is structured around it we don't have to change the protocol when we eventually optimize Bitcoin Core to be smarter. The other nice thing is this way the protocol is fairly DoS resistant natively, making it pretty easy to (in the future) expose out over the wire to semi-trusted clients, rather than relying on the client to not DoS the node.",

      "body": "I think there's about four reasons to want to switch around the mining interface to be push-based (rather than the current request-based):\r\n\r\n1) reduces (tail) latency when requesting a block. In most cases it won't matter, but immediately after finding a new block there is potentially a lot of `cs_main` contention with other peers sending us copies of the block header or peers requesting the block's transactions. Even ignoring the on-block stuff, you don't want to find yourself waiting for some relatively large transaction to fetch a bunch of UTXO entries off disk to get into the mempool to build your new block!\r\n2) allows for Bitcoin Core to decide when it wants to push a new block, enabling predictive block templates for the next block,\r\n3) allows Bitcoin Core to avoid updating the mempool or flushing to disk before pushing the next block (or doing so in parallel). Indeed, with cluster mempool the mempool part may matter less, but there may also be a future where UTXO state flushing can happen in parallel while block building happens. Just generally it means anything that happens in Bitcoin Core between when a block has been verified and when we are able to make a round-trip to another process and get `cs_main` again can be completely elided,\r\n4) enables a future where we move towards exposing the mining interface over the wire.\r\n\r\nOf course it doesn't have to happen in a particular version, but it'd be good to be sooner rather than later :).\r\n\r\nAlso good to do it sooner rather than later as some stuff outside Core (at least your work) will use the interface, and ideally all the cruft of the current interface gets removed once the interface is push-based, breaking existing clients but enabling the interface to go over the wire.",
