    "body": "<!-- This issue tracker is only for technical issues related to Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nGeneral bitcoin questions and/or support requests are best directed to the Bitcoin StackExchange at https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com.\r\n\r\nFor reporting security issues, please read instructions at https://bitcoincore.org/en/contact/.\r\n\r\nIf the node is \"stuck\" during sync or giving \"block checksum mismatch\" errors, please ensure your hardware is stable by running memtest and observe CPU temperature with a load-test tool such as linpack before creating an issue! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the issue -->\r\n\r\nI think it might be useful for certain applications to be able to get transaction fees from the RPC API. The problem is that loading all prevouts from disk could be pretty expensive depending on the number of inputs, so it should be made optional with a flag. One way to expose this in the API is to include the prevout (scriptPubKey & amount) with every input in vin, as well as adding a \"fee\" field to the top level of the response payload.\r\n\r\nHow would people feel about this?\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n",

For a start we'll add transaction fee information to `getblock` verbosity level 2. This comes at a negligible speed penalty (<1%). Optimally, we add a \"prevout\" KV to each input spent, displaying additional information like `value`, `scriptPubKey` and `height` for each input spent. Because this involves calculating addresses it is a lot more costly (~ 22% slower) so new verbosity level 3 is introduced.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoin-cli getblock 00000000000000000007fce39a80dc9110fe8709ee504c01e1f04f1f59be7bbf 2\r\n...\r\n      \"fees\": 0.00124850,\r\n...",
