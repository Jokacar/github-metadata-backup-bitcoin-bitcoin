Not locking cs_main while validating assumeutxo snapshots, so the node is responsive when the background chainstate download finishes.\r\n2. Deleting the background chainstate right away when it is no longer needed, instead of waiting until the next restart, which takes up extra disk space and slows down the next startup.",

          "body": "Add `util::Result` support for returning more error information and make use of it in [LoadChainstate method](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665/commits/0d33bcbf01c560bfc28111373a59ddee7813bdd8) as an initial application. Followup PR [#25722](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25722) uses it more broadly to return errors and warnings from wallet loading functions as well.\r\n\r\nThis change adds two major features to the result class:\r\n\r\n- For better error handling, adds the ability to return a value on failure, not just a value on success. This is a key missing feature that makes the result class not useful for functions like `LoadChainstate()` which produce different errors that need to be handled differently [^1].\r\n\r\n[^1]: Ability to return error values was actually present in the original implementation of [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218), but unfortunately removed in later iterations.\r\n\r\n- For better error reporting, adds the ability to return warning messages and multiple errors, not just a single error string. This provides a way for functions to report errors and warnings in a standard way, and simplifies interfaces:\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -virtual std::unique_ptr<Wallet> loadWallet(const std::string& name, bilingual_str& error, std::vector<bilingual_str>& warnings) = 0;\r\n    +virtual util::Result<std::unique_ptr<Wallet>> loadWallet(const std::string& name) = 0;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options, DatabaseStatus& status, bilingual_str& error);\r\n    +util::Result<std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase>, DatabaseError> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options);\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThis change also makes some more minor improvements:\r\n\r\n- Smaller type size. `util::Result<int>` is 16 bytes, and `util::Result<void>` is 8 bytes. Previously both were 72 bytes.\r\n\r\n- Broader type compatibility. Supports noncopyable and nonmovable success and error types.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives & design notes\r\n\r\nThe main goal for the `util::Result` class is to provide a standard way for functions to report error and warnings strings. The interface tries to make it easy to provide detailed error feedback to end users, without cluttering code or making it harder to return other result information. There have been multiple iterations of the design using different internal representations and providing different capabilities:\r\n\r\n|   | Representation (approximate)                   | Notes |\r\n|---|------------------------------------------------|-------|\r\n| _1_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Original #25218 implementation in da98fd2efc1a6b9c6e876cf3e227a8c2e9a10827. Good capabilities, but larger type size. Supports error standardized error reporting and customized error handling with failure values. |\r\n| _2_ | `variant<T,bilingual_str>`                | Final #25218 implementation in 7a45c33d1f8a758850cf8e7bd6ad508939ba5c0d. No support for returning failure values so not useful in many cases.\r\n| _3_ | `variant<monostate,T,F>`                 | Pending #25601 implementation that allows choosing whether to use standardized error reporting or return custom failure values, but doesn't support having both at the same time, like approaches _(1)_, _(4)_, _(5)_, _(6)_ do. |\r\n | _4_ | `tuple<variant<T,F>,bilingual_str>`      | Original #25608 implementation in c29d3008de9314dd463ed08e8bff39fe55324498. Basically the same as _(1)_ except it uses separate success and failure types instead of the same type. Using separate success and failure types makes the result class a little less flexible but can help avoid some ambiguity and inconsistent result states. |\r\n| _5_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Final #25608 implementation in dd91f294206ac87b213d23bb76656a0a5f0f4781. Essentially the same as original implementation _(1)_ except has some usability improvements. |\r\n| _6_ | `tuple<T,unique_ptr<tuple<F,bilingual_str>>` | Pending #25665 implementation (this PR). Supports returning failure values, uses separate success and failure types to avoid ambiguity, uses `unique_ptr` to reduce result type size, and avoids heap allocation in the happy path. |\r\n\r\n### Prior discussions & history\r\n\r\n- _furszy_ introduced a `BResult` class providing a standard error reporting mechanism in [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218). It was renamed to `util::Result` in [#25721](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25721) but kept the same representation and capabilities.\r\n\r\n- _MarcoFalke_ suggested using `BResult` for the `LoadChainstate` function in [#25308 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25308#issuecomment-1181674645). Inability to use `BResult` there due to lack of support for failure values led to initial work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _w0xlt_ wrote a `StructuredResult` class in [#25308](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25601) adding the ability to return failure values but sacrificing standard error reporting, which led to more work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _martinus_ suggested a space optimization in [#25608 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608#discussion_r921049409) that also made it easier to support distinct failure & success types, leading to [#25665](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665) as a replacement for [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).",

This PR makes the wallet UI safer by not rendering transactions as fully confirmed until the background validation is done.\r\n\r\nInstead it shows the same icon as when a transaction has 1 confirmation. This is quite conservative. The cost of tricking someone into accepting a fake coin, by giving them a invalid snapshot`*` and then mining a block on top of it, is higher than a regular doublespend by mining.\r\n\r\n![pending](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/10217/a2a95190-a1a7-402e-822b-b0829d5bdf45)\r\n\r\n`* =` in the current implementation this involves giving someone a malicious binary or getting them to recompile\r\n\r\nCaveat: because transaction state is updated after `blockConnected`, if you restart the node during background sync, then the transaction will show as fully confirmed (`\"assumed\": false`) briefly - until the next block is connected.",

          "body": "- Background and FAQ: https://github.com/jamesob/assumeutxo-docs/tree/2019-04-proposal/proposal\r\n- Prior progress/project: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/11\r\n- Replaces https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606, which was closed due to Github slowness. Original description and commentary can be found there.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis changeset finishes the first phase of the assumeutxo project. It makes UTXO snapshots loadable via RPC (`loadtxoutset`) and adds `assumeutxo` parameters to chainparams. It contains all the remaining changes necessary to both use an assumedvalid snapshot chainstate and do a full validation sync in the background.\r\n\r\nThis may look like a lot to review, but note that\r\n- ~200 lines are a (non-essential) demo shell script\r\n- Many lines are functional test, documentation, and relatively dilute RPC code.\r\n\r\nSo it shouldn't be as burdensome to review as the linecount might suggest.\r\n\r\n- **P2P**: minor changes are made to `init.cpp` and `net_processing.cpp` to make simultaneous IBD across multiple chainstates work.\r\n- **Pruning**: implement correct pruning behavior when using a background chainstate\r\n- **Blockfile separation**: to prevent \"fragmentation\" in blockfile storage, have background chainstates use separate blockfiles from active snapshot chainstates to avoid interleaving heights and impairing pruning.\r\n- **Indexing**: some `CValidationInterface` events are given with an additional parameter, ChainstateRole, and all indexers ignore events from ChainstateRole::ASSUMEDVALID so that indexation only happens sequentially.\r\n- Have `-reindex` properly wipe snapshot chainstates.\r\n- **RPC**: introduce RPC commands `loadtxoutset` and (hidden) `getchainstates`.\r\n- **Release docs & first assumeutxo commitment**: add notes and a particular assumeutxo hash value for first AU-enabled release.\r\n  - This will complete the project and allow use of UTXO snapshots for faster node bootstrap.\r\n\r\nThe next phase, if it were to be pursued, would be coming up with a way to distribute the UTXO snapshots over the P2P network.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### UTXO snapshots\r\n\r\nCreate your own with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh`, e.g. \r\n```shell\r\n./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh 788000 utxo.dat ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$(pwd)/testdata`)\r\n```\r\nor use the pre-generated ones listed below.\r\n\r\n- Testnet: **2'500'000** (Sjors):\r\n  - torrent: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:511e09f4bf853aefab00de5c070b1e031f0ecbe9&dn=utxo-testnet-2500000.dat&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl%3A6969`\r\n  - sha256: `79db4b025448cc0ac388d8589a28eab02de53055d181e34eb47391717aa16388`\r\n- Signet: **160'000** (Sjors):\r\n  - torrent: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:9da986cb27b3980ea7fd06b21e199b148d486880&dn=utxo-signet-160000.dat&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl%3A6969`\r\n  - sha256: `eeeca845385ba91e84ef58c09d38f98f246a24feadaad57fe1e5874f3f92ef8c`\r\n- Mainnet: **800'000** (Sjors):\r\n  - Note: this needs the following commit cherry-picked in: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/commit/24deb2022b822f22fba9fcbee201e37a83225eb2\r\n  - torrent: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:50ee955bef37f5ec3e5b0df4cf0288af3d715a2e&dn=utxo-800000.dat&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl%3A6969`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### For fun (~5min)\r\n\r\nIf you want to do a quick test, you can run `./contrib/devtools/test_utxo_snapshots.sh` and follow the instructions. This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob assumeutxo\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/assumeutxo\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.",

Also to make it easy to fix locking issues like the fact that\ncs_main is currently held unnecessarily validating snapshots, and the fact that\nbackground chainstate is not immediately deleted when it is no longer used,\nwasting disk space and adding a long startup delay next time the node is\nrestarted.\n\nThis follows up on some previous discussions:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24232#discussion_r835355848\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27746#discussion_r1321872262\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28562#discussion_r1344824078",

I think this is confusing to users that have never even thought about using assumeutxo since in that case the rebalancing is just ensuring the normal environment with one chainstate. So I suggest we don't log in absence of a snapshot chainstate. We could also think about rewording the message instead but I think this is simpler.\r\n",

At this point in time, code nits probably aren't going to be useful either.\r\n\r\nThis draft has been posted to provide a tangible example of a softfork we might pursue, and a representation of the necessary code changes.\r\n\r\n### Activation method and parameters\r\n\r\nSpecific activation parameters have not been specified here (or are marked FIXME) to avoid putting the consensus cart before the horse. The activation method here has defaulted to the one used for BIP-0341 and might change pending discussion.",

          "body": "This change drops `shutdown.h` and `shutdown.cpp` files, replacing them with a `NodeContext::shutdown` member which is used to trigger shutdowns directly. This gets rid of an unnecessary layer of indirection, and allows getting rid of the `kernel::g_context` global.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR tries to improve error handling of `SignalInterrupt` code by marking relevant methods `[[nodiscard]]` to avoid the possibility of uncaught exceptions mentioned https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27861#discussion_r1255496707.\r\n\r\nBehavior is changing In a few cases which are noted in individual commit messages. Particularly: GUI code more consistently interrupts RPCs when it is shutting down, shutdown state no longer persists between unit tests, the stop RPC now returns an RPC error if requesting shutdown fails instead of aborting, and other failed shutdown calls now log errors instead of aborting.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a net reduction in lines of code, but in some cases the explicit error handling and lack of global shutdown functions do make it more verbose. The verbosity can be seen as good thing if it discourages more code from directly triggering shutdowns, and instead encourages code to return errors or send notifications that could be translated into shutdowns. Probably a number of existing shutdown calls could just be replaced by better error handling.",

As a result, the fee estimator would block mempool's `cs` until it finished updating every time a new block was connected.\r\nInstead of being blocked only on mempool tx removal, we were blocking on both tx removal and fee estimator updating.\r\nIf we want to further improve fee estimation, or add heavy-calulation steps to it, it is currently not viable as we would be slowing down block relay in the process\r\n\r\nThis PR is smaller in terms of the changes made compared to #11775, as it focuses solely on enabling fee estimator updates from the validationInterface/cscheduler thread notifications.\r\n\r\nI have not split the validation interface because, as I understand it, the rationale behind the split in #11775 was to have `MempoolInterface` signals come from the mempool and `CValidationInterface` events come from validation. I believe this separation can be achieved in a separate refactoring PR when the need arises.\r\n\r\nAlso left out some commits from #11775\r\n- Some refactoring which are no longer needed.\r\n- Handle reorgs much better in fee estimator. \r\n- Track witness hash malleation in fee estimator \r\n\r\nI believe they are a separate change that can come in a follow-up after this.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Update on this PR: The state cleanup part of this PR is implemented. I think it is a nice change which should make code easier to understand by making chainstate objects self contained and removing assumeutxo specific special cases in validation code. It also net removes 140 lines of code.\r\n\r\nThe locking changes (not yet pushed) are a mess, though. As mentioned in the PR description, I'm trying to delete the background chainstate after snapshot validation without waiting for bitcoind to be restarted. This requires a mutex to protect chainstates from being deleted while they are in use, so I added a simple `m_chainstates_mutex` to guard the `m_chainstates` vector, but this has snowballed into a much bigger change because of lock ordering conflicts. Some parts of the code like `Chainstate::ActivateBestChain` need to lock `m_chainstates_mutex` before `cs_main` so `cs_main` can be released to let notifications be processed. But most code wants to lock `cs_main` first, and only needs to access `ChainstateManager` object briefly to get a reference to the active chain, so it more naturally locks `cs_main` before `m_chainstates_mutex`. I was able to make cleanups in validation.cpp, moving things between `Chainstate` and `ChainstateManager` to acquire `m_chainstates_mutex` before `cs_main`, or relying on `Chainstate` members and avoiding the need to lock `m_chainstates_mutex` at all, and I think these changes are good, but after doing this (3b5c646790c55c01c318bce7d029a8d9e67147bc) it turns out the lock order inconsistency is much worse in net_processing than validation, and it would not be good for performance or code complexity to try lock `m_chainstates_mutex` before `cs_main` there.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of taking a different approach of using a shared mutex instead of an exclusive mutex to protect access to `Chainstate` instances and prevent them from being deleted while in use. Then code could freely obtain shared locks to `m_chainstates_mutex` and exclusive locks to `cs_main` in either order. In order to prevent deadlocks, the small amount of code that creates and deletes chainstates and needs exclusive access to both locks would just need to be careful to acquire both locks atomically and never hold one exclusive lock while it is waiting for the other. This idea is conceptually pretty simple, and it could introduce support for shared locking that could be useful in other contexts. But I'm not exactly sure what approach to take with the implementation, and I'm worried it may run into problems with compiler thread safety analysis. I'm also wondering if it might make sense to pause working on locking and instead work on splitting up the current PR into commits to make it more reviewable.",
