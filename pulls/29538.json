I agree with that sentiment and think it would be beneficial to make this explicit by renaming the inherited function.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for `ConstructBlockHash()`.",

This could be useful in the future for using or testing these classes without having to instantiate any form of signal handling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587). It improves the kernel API and removes two modules from the kernel library.",

          "body": "When running with `-debug=validation` the log is filled with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-03-19T12:46:01Z [validation] Enqueuing TransactionAddedToMempool: txid=37c8e1ef87d75a67fbaf44e116018fbc70d9c4ef0e27e2ae56861395101f9b8e wtxid=24e2d76012f9cde451d085ead4feab136feddae6cb55d37221a81aac6c0eaf42\r\n2023-03-19T12:46:01Z [validation] TransactionAddedToMempool: txid=37c8e1ef87d75a67fbaf44e116018fbc70d9c4ef0e27e2ae56861395101f9b8e wtxid=24e2d76012f9cde451d085ead4feab136feddae6cb55d37221a81aac6c0eaf42\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese log entries are more appropriate for `-debug=mempool`.\r\n\r\nThis change limits `-debug=validation` to messages that are related to blocks and headers. It also downgrades `Enqueuing` messages to the `Trace` level.\r\n\r\nIt makes it easier to run for a long time without excessive log file growth. This debug category is particularly useful for keeping track of problematic headers that were seen, the timing of reorgs, see also #27276.\r\n\r\nSince this PR touches `validationinterface.cpp` anyway, it also includes a commit to drop function names from log messages, since we now have `-logsourcelocations`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, though less important, I moved `[validation] Pre-allocating up to position 0x… in rev….dat` messages to blockstorage. This reduces the number of `[validation]` log messages further. ~to 3 per (normal) block.~\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volume of log messages [could also have been reduced](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27277#discussion_r1141375638) by changing the log level of these messages to `trace`. Doing so would prevent a whack-a-mole game of moving log messages to different categories. However in this case I think the change in log category would be justified even if it didn't have a big impact on noise. I.e. someone running with `-debug=mempool` would expect to see the `TransactionAddedToMempool` messages and someone running with `-debug=blockstorage` would perhaps be surprised to not see the `Pre-allocating` message.",

If this helps us with reasoning about these things easier and prevents footguns, we should do it. If it's confusing someone who is contributing to this project that there is a distinction between hashing just header and hashing the whole block, I think that is a great learning opportunity for them and this might actually prevent them from shooting themselves in the foot in the future :)",

As the mutated block logging is and has been useful for detecting and debugging problem of some mining pools, it's re-added here. See the conversation starting here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29412#issuecomment-1971206525.\r\n\r\nOld blocks can cheaply be mutated and send to us. We don't log when receiving these. However, blocks with a valid PoW (above our DoS threshold) that we didn't know about could indicate a problem, for example, on the miner side. By logging about these mutated blocks, we make it easier to notice and debug these cases.",

          "title": "net_processing: make any misbehavior trigger immediate discouragement",
          "body": "So far, discouragement of peers triggers when their misbehavior score exceeds 100 points. Most types of misbehavior increment the score by 100, triggering immediate discouragement, but some types do not. This PR makes all increments equal to either 100 (meaning any misbehavior will immediately cause disconnection and discouragement) or 0 (making the behavior effectively unconditionally allowed), and then removes the logic for score accumulation.\r\n\r\nThis simplifies the code a bit, but also makes protocol expectations clearer: if a peer misbehaves, they get disconnected. There is no good reason why certain types of protocol violations should be permitted 4 times (howmuch=20) or 9 times (howmuch=10), while many others are never allowed. Furthermore, the distinction between these looks arbitrary.\r\n\r\nTo assess whether this does not unduly affect existing other software on the network, I've been running this with an additional patch (see https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commits/202403_nomisbehave_log) that adds logging whenever behavior is detected whose misbehavior increment is changed to 100 by this PR. Over the past day I have not seen any instances on my well-connected node (~150 incoming connections), but will continue to monitor.\r\n\r\nThe specific types of misbehavior that are changed to 100 are:\r\n* Sending us a `block` which does not connect to our header tree (which necessarily must have been unsollicited). [used to be score 10]\r\n* Sending us a `headers` with a non-continuous headers sequence. [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 1000 addresses in a single `addr` or `addrv2` message [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 50000 invs in a single `inv` message [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 2000 headers in a single `headers` message [used to be score 20]\r\n\r\nThe specific types of misbehavior that are changed to 0 are:\r\n* Sending us 10 (*) separate BIP130 headers announcements that do not connect to our block tree [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 8 headers in a single `headers` message (which thus does not get treated as a BIP130 announcement) that does not connect to our block tree. [used to be score 10]\r\n\r\nI believe that none of these behaviors are unavoidable, except for the one marked (*) which can in theory happen still due to interaction between BIP130 and variations in system clocks (the max 2 hour in the future rule). This one has been removed entirely. In order to remove the impact of the bug it was designed to deal with, without relying on misbehavior, a separate improvement is included that makes `getheaders`-tracking more accurate.\r\n\r\nIn another unrelated improvement, this also gets rid of the 8 header limit heuristic to determine whether an incoming non-connecting `headers` is a potential BIP130 announcement, as this rule is no longer needed to prevent spurious Misbehavior. Instead, any non-connecting `headers` is now treated as a potential announcement.",

          "title": "kernel: Handle fatal errors through return values",
          "body": "Based on #25665.\r\n\r\nCurrently functions issuing fatal errors call the `fatalError` notification method to issue a shutdown procedure. This makes it hard for higher level functions to figure out if an error deeper in the call stack occurred. For users of the kernel it might also be difficult to assert which function call issued a fatal error if they are being run concurrently. If the kernel would eventually be used by external users, getting fatal error information through a callback instead of function return values would also be cumbersome and limiting. Unit, bench, and fuzz tests currently don't have a way to effectively test against fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThis patch set is an attempt to make fatal error handling in the kernel code more transparent. Fatal errors are now passed up the call stack through `util::Result<T, FatalError>` failure values. A previous attempt at this by theuni always immediately returned failure values if a function call returned a failure. However, this is not always desirable (see discussion [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27866#discussion_r1256378064)). Sometimes, further operations can still be completed even if a fatal error was issued. The solution to this is that these \"ignored\" errors are still moved through `util::Result`'s error string values with its `.MoveMessages` method, even while a failure value in the result is not present.\r\n\r\nNext to some smaller behavior changes, the most significant change is that the issuing of a shutdown procedure is delayed until a potential fatal error is handled as opposed to immediately when it is first encountered. Another effect is that potential fatal errors are now asserted in the bench, fuzz and unit tests. Some of the currently not immediately returned fatal errors need some further scrutiny. These are marked with a `TODO (fatal error)` comment and could be tackled in a later PR.\r\n\r\nTo validate this approach a new clang-tidy check is introduced. It implements the following checks:\r\n\r\n1. If a function calls another function with a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` return type, its return type has to be `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` too, or it has to handle the value returned by the function with one of `CheckFatal`, `HandleFatalError`,\r\n`UnwrapFatalError`, or `CheckFatalFailure`.\r\n2. In functions returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` a call to a function returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` needs to propagate the value by either:\r\n   - Returning it immediately\r\n   - Assigning it immediately to an existing result with `.MoveMessages()` or `.Set()`\r\n   - Eventually passing it as an argument to a `.MoveMessages()`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587) and is a step towards stage 2, creating a more refined kernel API.",

It is literally the `GetHash()` inherited from `CBlockHeader` that we are actually calling. It is a good point though that the hash also contains the prevblock header hash that is also not validated.\r\n\r\nClosing this due to lack of support but I still think this would be a good idea.",
