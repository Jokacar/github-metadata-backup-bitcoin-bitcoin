    "body": "When the default wallet is migrated, we do not rename the wallet so we end up having a descriptor wallet with the empty string as its name and the wallet.dat file in the root of the walletdir. This is supposed to be an unsupported configuration and there is no other way to achieve this (other than file copying), but the wallet loading code does not disallow loading such wallets. However `listwalletdir` does not currently list the default wallet if it is sqlite. This is confusing to users, so change `listwalletdir` to include these wallets.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the migration of the default wallet, and of any plain wallet files in the walletdir, produces a backup file in the walletdir itself. Since these backups are a BDB file, `listwalletdir` will detect them as being another wallet that we could open, but this is erroneous and could lead to confusion and potentially funds loss if both the backup and the migrated wallet are in use simultaneously. To reduce the likelihood of this issue, don't list these wallets in `listwalletdir`.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nPossibly we could have more stringent checks on loading to resolve these issues, but I'm concerned that that will just confuse users and gratuitously break things that already worked.\r\n\r\nSince the original intent was to disallow default wallets for sqlite/descriptors, a possible alternative would be to prevent people from loading such wallets and change migration to rename those wallets. However, given that this behavior with migrating default wallets has existed since default wallet migration was fixed, I think that making such a change would be confusing and break things for no good reason. Although perhaps we should still do the renaming.\r\n\r\nFor the backups, we could also change loading to refuse to load any wallet named with `.bak` (or `.legacy.bak`) as such wallets can still be loaded by giving the path to them directly, which some users may do to \"restore\" the backup. However restricting what can be loaded based on filename seems a little heavyhanded. It wouldn't be funds loss though since the correct way to restore the backup is with `restorewallet`.",

          "body": "Here is a proposed timeline for the move from legacy wallets to descriptor wallets, and at the same time, bdb to sqlite, culminating with the removal of both legacy wallets and bdb. Even though the wallet type and the wallet storage format are orthogonal to each other, as noted in #19077, I would like to tie them together for the sake of simplicity when it comes to how we make new wallets and the migration of one type to another.\r\n\r\nThe 4 combinations of type and format are: legacy-bdb, legacy-sqlite, descriptor-bdb, and descriptor-sqlite. While all 4 types will be supported, we will primarily deal with legacy-bdb and descriptor-sqlite. Setting `descriptors=True` in `createwallet` (or checking the Descriptors option in the GUI) will always make a descriptor-sqlite. Setting that to `False` will always make a legacy-bdb.\r\n\r\n- [x] 0.21 (late 2020)\r\n  - [x] Initial release of descriptor type and sqlite format. (#16528, #19077)\r\n  - [x] Descriptor type is experimental with a warning as such (#16528)\r\n  - [x] Only legacy-bdb and descriptor-sqlite will be created (#19077)\r\n- [x] 22.0 (mid 2021)\r\n  - [x] Implement descriptor exports (#20226)\r\n  - [x] Legacy type remains default (no pr needed)\r\n  - [x] Introduce `dump` and `createfromdump` wallet tool commands with an additional `-format` option to specify the wallet type (#19137)\r\n    * Users may use `dump` and then `createfromdump` in order to make legacy-sqlite from legacy-bdb\r\n    * Users may use `dump` and then `createfromdump` in order to make descriptor-bdb from descriptor-sqlite\r\n  - [x] If a wallet specified in conf or command line doesn't exist, don't make a wallet and instead warn (#15454)\r\n- [x] 23.0 (early 2022)\r\n  - [x] Change descriptor type to non-experimental (#23002)\r\n  - [x] Change `createwallet` `descriptors` default to `True` (#23002)\r\n  - [x] Change wallet tool `create` `-descriptors` default to `True` (#23002)\r\n- [x] 24.0 (late 2022)\r\n  - [x] Introduce `migratewallet` command to migrate a legacy-bdb to descriptor-sqlite (#19602)\r\n  - [x] For newly created legacy-bdb wallets, warn that they are deprecated and will soon be unsupported (#24505)\r\n- [x] 26.0 (late 2023)\r\n  - [x] When loading legacy-bdb, descriptor-bdb, or legacy-sqlite wallets, warn that the legacy type and bdb format will soon be unsupported, as applicable.

          "body": "Currently the Migrate Wallet menu item can only be used to migrate the currently loaded wallet. This is not suitable for the future when legacy wallets can no longer be loaded at all, but should still be able to be migrated. This PR changes that menu item into a menu list like Open Wallet and lets users migrate any legacy wallet in their wallet directory regardless of the wallets loaded.\r\n\r\nOne issue I ran into was dealing with encrypted wallets. Ideally, we would detect whether a wallet is encrypted, and prompt the user for their passphrase at that time. However, that's actually difficult to do in the GUI since migration will unload the wallet if it was already loaded, and reload it without connecting it to any signals or interfaces. Only then can it detect whether a wallet is encrypted, but then there is no `WalletModel` or even an `interfaces::Wallet` that the GUI could use to unlock it via a callback.\r\n\r\nTo deal with this, I've opted to just add a button to the migration dialog box that has the user enter their passphrase first, along with instructional text to use that button if their wallet was encrypted. If the user enters the wrong passphrase or clicked the other button that does not prompt for the passphrase, migration will fail with a message indicating that the passphrase was incorrect.",
