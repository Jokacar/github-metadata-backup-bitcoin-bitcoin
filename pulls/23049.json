    "body": "This PR provides a simple example of how to import and use the `sv2-ffi` Rust crate which exports the Stratum V2 (Sv2) functions required by a Template Provider as a C library.\r\n\r\n## Stratum V2\r\n[An introduction to Sv2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1efN1JnAGiTw96LtfP70BngtP49SLtbMahPYSROfiMqA/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n[Sv2 specifiaction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FadCWj-57dvhxsnFM_7X806qyvhR0u3i85607bGHxvg/edit)\r\n\r\n## Template Provider\r\nSv2 defines a service (role) called the Template Provider (TP), whose functionality is defined as follows:\r\n```\r\nGenerates the custom block templates to be passed to the Job Negotiator for eventual mining. \r\nThis is usually a Bitcoin Core full node (or possibly another node implementation).\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Phase 1: PR Goals\r\nThis phase encompasses the concepts that must be agreed upon before proceeding with Phase 2.\r\n\r\n1. Need agreement that implementing a TP in Bitcoin Core is a good idea.\r\n2. Need agreement that the implementation of a TP in Bitcoin Core should use the Rust crates in [this workspace](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum).\r\n\r\n## Phase 2: PR Implementation\r\nThis phase will commence once the concepts in Phase 1 are agreed upon. Phase 2 is the final goal of this project and encompasses the the implementation steps required for a functional TP in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n1. Extensive review of the `sv2-ffi` API and other Rust sources.\r\n2. Review of the guix build process.\r\n3. Find a location for the Sv2 crates (possibly under the [Bitcoin GitHub Account](https://github.com/bitcoin/)) to live _*1_.\r\n4. Implement the TP.\r\n\r\n## If TP in Core gets a concept NACK\r\nA TP can be implemented as an independent service and can communicate with core via RPC.\r\n\r\n## If Rust in Core gets a concept NACK\r\nA TP can be implemented in core without using any Rust dependency.\r\n\r\n_*1_ Right now the Rust sources are in this PR and are packaged by a script before doing the guix build. Ideally these sources should live in another project repository and should be packaged by the guix script which builds a downloadable binary.",

Though it doesn't introduce a new thread where the logic would co-run with other Core's current threads (`ThreadSocketHandler`, `ThreadOpenConnection`, ...). I initially followed this approach when I proposed AltNet with #18988. After gathering [feedbacks](https://gnusha.org/bitcoin-core-dev/2020-05-21.log) from other contributors, a separated process sounds a more flexible and safer approach.\r\n\r\nRecently, I've made some progress in this direction by building on top of the [multiprocess](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102) project (see the hacky branch https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/commits/2021-07-altnet-lightning). Process separation is promising, though going further I'm aiming to have AltNet pluggin modules written in Rust, while interfacing in Core over the  Cap'n Proto newer interfaces. The current bottleneck is re-writing `libmultiprocess` in Rust, see https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/56 for more information. It's more work than expected though I've a branch half-written doing that, hope to make it public soon(tm).\r\n\r\nI think such modules or the one proposed in the current PR could live beyond the Core repository to avoid burdening the maintenance effort and the concerns about Rust chain of trust, while consuming the stable interfaces to ease deployment across the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nGlad to see progress on the miner infrastructure, that's really needed!",

      "body": "Strong Concept ACK. At a high level, this is incredibly important work for a few reasons:\r\n * having a good block template producer in Bitcoin Core is critical for moving Bitcoin's mining decentralization forward over the coming years, the importance of which cannot be understated,\r\n * Bitcoin Core having more visibility/control into how and when block templates get produced gives Bitcoin Core a ton more flexibility going forward to do things like pre-construct next-next-block templates in advance and push them out quicker, gives Bitcoin Core a ton more control of when transactions get included in a block by enabling \"push\" support for template updates instead of only being polled, etc,\r\n * the inefficiencies of getblocktemplate have been a real source of pain for pool operators for some time, I'm excited its going away.\r\n\r\nAs for multi-process, I don't think this is a good candidate for multi-process - block template building is incredibly latency-sensitive, plus needs full access to the mempool and block template construction. At most, I'd think we could think of doing the block template construction in Core and then handing the template off to a new process which does the StratumV2 protocol work, but (a) that adds a bunch more latency for no reason, and (b) you'd probably just use the StratumV2 protocol to communicate with that other binary, so why? In general, one reason to consider rust for the protocol side of this is precisely because you *don't* need to worry as much about it being in the same binary - the actual network logic itself isn't going to corrupt memory.",

I don't personally know Rust, and suspect that many contributors/reviewers aren't as comfortable with Rust, so I think my criterion for this is whether it's something that we can treat as external, existing, known-to-work, code that's maintained separately - like say libevent or LevelDB, and not something that would expect detailed review from this project. Evidence that this same code is used in other contexts/projects would certainly help. The fact that this would be code that's only accessible through a local, optional, interface makes the safety analysis a lot easier.\r\n* I haven't followed the state of affairs with StratumV2. If it's expected that a significant part of the mining ecosystem will end up depending on this protocol, I agree it makes sense to include it in Bitcoin Core, and agree with @TheBlueMatt that direct integration is the lowest-latency solution.\r\n* I believe Guix indeed solves the concern of having bootstrapping the Rust compiler, at least to the same extent that our C++ compilers for release builds are bootstrapped too. Right, @dongcarl?\r\n\r\nSo conditionally on getting some confirmation on my assumptions above, (somewhat hesitant) Concept ACK.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Big concept ACK on supporting the use of StratumV2, but slight concept NACK on bundling it with the introduction of Rust, barring some additional context/rationale. It'd be nice to see a compelling reason why Rust should be used for this particular feature other than the standard potpourri of \"Rust is safer/more ergonomic in $X_GENERAL_WAY.\" *Edit:* I do see that this change pulls in a stratum Rust library, so maybe that's why?\r\n\r\nI have a number of questions about how Rust will dovetail with the existing codebase (and this PR might not be the appropriate place to discuss them), but some that come to mind in the context of this change are \r\n- how will use of Rust work with existing locks and lock annotations? \r\n  - E.g., are we going to lose the use of [our deadlock detection tooling](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/sync.cpp) within Rust code?\r\n- what's the real cost of maintenance/additional complexity in the build system?\r\n- how much third-party code does this actually entail dragging in? AFAIU, concurrency, e.g., is not a simple thing in Rust and often entails the use of third-party libs like [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio).\r\n\r\nIf Rust is really a critical part of doing this feature, maybe we should look at how to offer the raw data necessary (in a performant way) to construct any number of block template formats outside of Core, by supplying data in a generic format over e.g. Unix sockets.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "It's been 5 years since using LTO was first suggested for use when building Bitcoin Core, and it's time to revisit it again. Compilers, and their LTO implementations, have matured, and Bitcoin Core has come a long way in terms of pruning dependencies which may have proved troublesome (i.e Boost previously had issues when using LTO). We'll have even less Boost code after moving to `std::filesystem` (#20744).\r\n\r\nExperimenting with LTO came up on IRC last night:\r\n> sipa: jamesob: i'm interested in knowing whether \"-flto\" and/or \"-fdata-sections -ffunction-sections -Wl,--gc-sections\" are possible/beneficial with our current compiler suite; what would be a good way to have your test infrastructure benchmark things?\r\n\r\nSo this PR just adds the bare minimum to make it easier to configure, compile and perform some bench-marking using `-flto`. This PR doesn't do anything depends wise, however if we decide this is what we want to do, I'll expand the changes here.\r\n\r\nI had previously had a PR open (#18605) to perform link time garbage collection (`-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections` & `-Wl,--gc-sections`), however moving straight to using LTO would be preferable.\r\n\r\nNote that our minimum required set of compilers, GCC 8.1 and Clang 7, all support the `-flto` option.\r\n\r\nRelated #18579.\r\nPrevious discussion: #10616, #14277.\r\nPrevious related PRs: #10800 (`-flto`), #16791 (ThinLTO).\r\n\r\nGuix

          "title": "build: tighter Univalue integration, remove `--with-system-univalue`",
          "body": "This PR more tightly integrates building Univalue into our build system. This follows the same approach we use for [LevelDB](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/leveldb/), ([`Makefile.leveldb.include`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/Makefile.leveldb.include)), and [CRC32C](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/crc32c) ([`Makefile.crc32c.include`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/Makefile.crc32c.include)), and will be the same approach we use for [minisketch](https://github.com/sipa/minisketch); see #23114.\r\n\r\nThis approach yields a number of benefits, including:\r\n* Faster configuration due to one less subconfigure being run during `./configure` i.e 22s with this PR vs 26s\r\n* Faster autoconf i.e 13s with this PR vs 17s\r\n* Improved caching\r\n* No more issues with compiler flags i.e https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12467\r\n* More direct control means we can build exactly the objects we want\r\n\r\nThere might be one argument against making this change, which is that builders should have the option to use \"proper shared/system libraries\". However, I think that falls down for a few reasons. The first being that we already don't support building with a number of system libraries (secp256k1, leveldb, crc32c); some for good reason. Univalue is really the odd one out at the moment. \r\n\r\nNote that the only fork of Core I'm aware of, that actively patches in support for using system libs, also explicitly marks them as [\"DANGEROUS\"](https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin/blob/a886811721ce66eb586871706b3f5dd27518ac3e/configure.ac#L1430) and [\"NOT SUPPORTED\"](https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin/blob/a886811721ce66eb586871706b3f5dd27518ac3e/configure.ac#L1312). So it would seem they exist more to satisfy a distro requirement, as opposed to something that anyone should, or would actually use in practice.\r\n\r\nPRs like #22412 highlight the \"issue\" with us operating with our own Univalue fork, where we actively fix bugs, and make improvements, when upstream (https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue) may not be taking those improvements, and by all accounts, is not currently actively maintained. Bitcoin Core should not be hamstrung into not being able to fix bugs in a library, and/or have to litter our source with \"workarounds\", i.e #22412, for bugs we've already fixed, based on the fact that an upstream project is not actively being maintained. Allowing builders to use system libs is really only exacerbating this problem, with little benefit to our project. Bitcoin Core is not quite like your average piece of distro packaged software.\r\n\r\nThere is the potential for us to give the same treatment to libsecp256k1, however it seems doing that is currently less straightforward.",

          "body": "This is split from #21667.\r\n\r\nFor users, one of the preferred ways to use the Bitcoin Core client is compiling from source, either downloaded as a part of release or acquired via git.\r\n\r\nOnly basic knowledge about terminal is required to run:\r\n```\r\n$ cd bitcoin\r\n$ ./autogen.sh\r\n$ ./configure\r\n$ make check\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, it is natural to expect that number of users that have such knowledge is higher than the number of advanced users or developers.\r\n\r\nAssuming the basic knowledge level of users it seems unwise to allow compiler and linker warnings because they could undermine the users' trust in the Bitcoin Core quality/security/reliability.\r\n\r\nOf course, warnings could be emitted by different parts of code: either the code we are responsible for, or third parties code, including sub-trees in our repo:\r\n- https://github.com/google/crc32c\r\n- https://github.com/google/leveldb\r\n\r\nand other dependencies:\r\n- https://github.com/libevent/libevent\r\n- https://github.com/boostorg/boost\r\n- https://github.com/qt/qtbase\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nCurrently, warnings from `leveldb` are suppressed _unconditionally_: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/599000903e09e5ae3784d15ae078a2e1ed89ab12/src/Makefile.leveldb.include#L39\r\n\r\nOTOH, warnings from Qt and Boost code could be suppressed with the `--enable-suppress-external-warnings` configure option.\r\n\r\nMaking the `--enable-suppress-external-warnings` the default has the following benefits:\r\n- don't alarm users who compile from source\r\n- increase signal/noise ratio for developers when a new warning appears in our code (as an example, Qt warnings on macOS, where Homebrew's Qt is pretty fresh)\r\n- allows to apply more `-W` and `-Werror` options by default (for example, `-Wdocumentation` and `-Werror=documentation` introduced in #21613)\r\n\r\nThere was an [objection](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21667#issuecomment-820185228): \r\n> I don't think we should make `--enable-suppress-external-warnings` the default, but it should be better documented. Someone needs to be motivated to fix things upstream and/or notice problems when we update dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe answer to this objection is that fixing \"things upstream\" is not the top priority for developers. It is always possible to build with the `--disable-suppress-external-warnings`. Even more, with this PR the `--disable-suppress-external-warnings` will reveal `leveldb` warning as well.",

      "body": "> If Rust is really a critical part of doing this feature, maybe we should look at how to offer the raw data necessary (in a performant way) to construct any number of block template formats outside of Core, by supplying data in a generic format over e.g. Unix sockets.\r\n\r\nHi @jamesob:\r\n* why rust: main reason to use rust it to not rewrite an already working set of libraries, the libraries have been written to be used  both in core (for the implementation of the TP) and in rust (for the implementation of the other Sv2 roles) \r\n* how will Rust work with existing locks: do not know I will check\r\n* cost of maintenance/additional complexity in the build system: IMHO is pretty insignificant.\r\n  Support TP in the build system add:\r\n    1. few lines in the config file in order to check if there is the flag `--enable-template-provider` and if the system that will build core has at least rustc 1.51.\r\n    2. An m4 function pulled from the gnu repo ax_compare_version.\r\n    3. A make file that call rustc with the correct flag and build the rust library then add the builded library to LDFLAGS so that is linked with bitocoind (this is the most complex addition to the build system and are only 159 LOC that do a very simple task)\r\n    4. It modify 2 line in the guix build and add rustc 1.51 in the manifest\r\n* how much third-party: the rust code added in order to build the TP in core do not have any external dependency but std.\r\n* doing it externally: this was my original idea but, as stated also in the above post by @TheBlueMatt:\r\n  *block template building is incredibly latency-sensitive, plus needs full access to the mempool and block template construction*",

It leverages [musl-cross-make](https://github.com/richfelker/musl-cross-make) to compile a musl libc targeting toolchain, made up of GCC 10.3.0 + binutils 2.37 + musl libc 1.2.3, and then uses that toolchain to build our depends libraries, and ultimately `bitcoind`.\r\n\r\nMore than likely we'd take a different approach in Guix for (potentially) release builds, however, something like this could exist in depends, and provide an alternative to building against glibc outside Guix. Or, this may well end up being something we just throw away in favour of a better approach; still lots to be thought about here.\r\n\r\nOnly tested compiling on, for `x86_64-pc-linux-gnu` so far.\r\n\r\nYou can use it as follows:\r\n```bash\r\nmake -C depends/ -j9 NO_QT=1 NO_WALLET=1 NO_UPNP=1 NO_ZMQ=1 NO_NATPMP=1 USE_MUSL_LIBC=1 HOST=x86_64-linux-musl\r\n./autogen.sh\r\nCONFIG_SITE=/path/to/your/bitcoin/depends/x86_64-pc-linux-musl/share/config.site ./configure --enable-reduce-exports --enable-lto LDFLAGS=\"-Wl,-O2\" LIBTOOL_APP_LDFLAGS=\"-all-static\"\r\nmake src/bitcoind\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe end result (once stripped) is a ~10mb static `bitcoind`:\r\n```bash\r\nldd src/bitcoind\r\n\tstatically linked\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you see:\r\n```bash\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'\r\n  what():  locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid\r\nAborted (core dumped)\r\n```\r\nwhen running, pass `LC_ALL=C`. i.e `LC_ALL=C src/bitcoind`. \r\n\r\nI've taken the binary onto a few different system / inside VMs, and am running a full sync.\r\n\r\nNote that all dependencies do compile, except for Qt (build issue with FreeType I have not investigated), I've just excluded all optional dependencies from the depends build above.\r\n\r\nWhen building, you may see warnings about libraries, such as `libstdc++`, as having been moved, during linking, and/or other warnings, from dependencies, such as sqlite, due to `-flto` usage.\r\n\r\nRelated to #18110.",

          "body": "Moving the discussion from #15798 here, as it makes more sense to have it in an issue instead of a PR. #15798 no longer reflects the current proposed Rust changes, and Rust related work is now happening across multiple others.\r\n\r\n[Corys](https://github.com/theuni/) thoughts / introduction from #15798:\r\n\r\n> This is not intended to be merged as-is, but instead to serve as a reference for anyone who might be interested in trying out some rust code inside of Bitcoin Core. I have no idea what works. I have lots of questions about debugging, threading, etc. But instead of trying to hack and document how things work, we thought it'd be fun for everyone to be able to poke at it and scratch our heads together :). If something interesting comes out of it, a discussion about merging can happen then.\r\n\r\n> It is surprisingly functional. The rust tools are impeccable. I would've thought this would be a project that would take months/years, but the rust devs have done such a good job that mostly everything already just works. The gitian descriptors have been modified to actually incorporate working rust code. All of our currently supported platforms seem to already work (even macOS cross!) with the exception of 32bit windows and ancient linux distros. The specific issues are documented in the gitian descriptors. For now, Gitian needs net access and a larger disk volume, but those are both very temporary issues\r\n\r\n> Why rust? I don't know. Maybe not. But I think it's a fair assumption to say that Rust code will eventually end up in Bitcoin Core as the result of adding a new dependency. Adoption is happing quickly. So, I think it prudent to look ahead and not only be prepared, but actively help usher it in. Already I have a few things that I would like to work on and upstream to rust-lang to make our integration nicer, and I assume that more will be uncovered as it actually gets used.\r\n\r\n> Anybody have any fun ideas?\r\n\r\nThere's still discussion to be had / documentation to be added around various Rust related decisions, such as:\r\n* Whether to use/require the `2015` or `2018` Editions.\r\n* A minimum required version of the language.\r\n* How failures in the Rust code are (expected to be) handled by the c++ code.\r\n\r\nAs well as higher level discussions around how far we might take the Rust integration/re-writing of certain parts of the code, and the complexities that could introduce in regards which contributors can/can't write/review Rust, or have more/less experience with the language compared to `C++` etc.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd like to think that we'll have some off-by-default Rust as part of the Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 release; and I think something like #16834 might be a good first approach. Regardless of approach, the idea of using Rust inside Bitcoin Core seems to resonate with some of the (still limited set) of other contributors I've discussed it with.\r\n\r\n#### Using `rustc` directly instead of Cargo\r\nThe initial Rust [integration PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15798) used [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo) for managing compiling, dependencies etc. Since then, the Rust changes have been refactored to remove the `cbindgen` dependency and drop any usage of Cargo altogether, in favour of using [`rustc` directly](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16834/files#diff-480477e89f9b6ddafb30c4383dcdd705R371).\r\n\r\nSee also the recent [Security advisory for Cargo](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/09/30/Security-advisory-for-cargo.html).\r\n\r\n#### Related PRs\r\n[Fetch Headers over DNS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16834)\r\n[Rust-based Backup over-REST block downloader](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16762)\r\n[Add Parallel P2P Client in Rust](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17376)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Related Reading\r\n[Bootstrapping Rust using Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2018/bootstrapping-rust/)",

          "body": "Completes the migration to using a native GCC 10 toolchain for all HOSTS. This change means we'll now use GCC 10 when compiling glibc and friends (currently we use GCC 7), which is the same as our release compiler, except for macOS (Clang 10). Note that Guix has also switched it's default compiler from GCC 7 to GCC 10.

The goal is to initiate discussion and gather feedback on the proposed changes to see if there is sufficient support for an ACK before finalizing an implementation.\r\n\r\nThis PR initially proposes the addition of a new thread and server to enable Bitcoin Core to run as a Sv2 TP (Stratum V2 Template Provider). This approach is the most direct and naive approach in regards to integrating into the Bitcoin architecture. It builds on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23049 but no longer uses the Rust library and implements the server and message de/serialization in C++.\r\n\r\nThis PR branch has been used for testing with the [SRI (Stratum V2 Reference Implementation)](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum), but it has been limited to regtest and some tests on testnet. This branch is considered far from complete.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nStratum V2 is a proposed evolution of the stratum mining protocol, it has several benefits over its predecessor:\r\n\r\n- By default, it uses secure communication, which can protect against man-in-the-middle-attacks, e.g. [hashrate hijacking](https://braiins.com/blog/hashrate-robbery-stratum-v2-fixes-this-and-more)                                                           \r\n\r\n- It uses a binary protocol instead of JSON, optimizing data transfer between all parties\r\n\r\n- It allows miners/downstream connections to propose their own transaction sets to mining pools                                                                                                                                    \r\n\r\n- It can reduce occurrence of empty mined blocks\r\n\r\nLinks below for further reference:\r\n\r\n- Stratum V2 specification: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec\r\n- SRI (Stratum V2 Reference Implementation): https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum\r\n- Stratum V2 overview: https://stratumprotocol.org/\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \r\nThe motivation for this PR and potential future work is to allow Bitcoin Core to run as a Sv2 TP. This will enable downstream Sv2 connections to be able to connect and receive/submit valid work over the Sv2 protocol.\r\n\r\nBelow is an outline of a few pros/cons regarding the Sv2 TP  in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n- Running Bitcoin Core with a config flag to enable the Sv2 TP could be arguably easier for adoption. A user would only need to be able to compile and run Bitcoin Core and its dependencies to be able to extract valid work and broadcast legitimate work over the Sv2 protocol\r\n\r\n- The Sv2 TP being as close as possible to the mempool and p2p network benefits downstream connections so that they can start new work quickly. The time between a node learning of a  new best block and then sending new work downstream should be as minimal as possible\r\n\r\n- Implementing the Sv2 TP in C++ means it should be (hopefully) easier for a wider range of contributors/reviewers to be able to maintain and build. The Sv2 TP only uses a small subset of messages from the entire Sv2 Rust library. Therefore, we realized that re-implementing a subset of the messages in C++ and implementing a server carries less external dependency risk and less architectural complexity\r\n\r\n- No additional external dependencies are required\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n- The Sv2 TP in core will need to be kept up to date with changes in the SRI, coordination would be required to prevent any potential versioning issues\r\n\r\n- Adds  another thread/sub-module that will need to access the mempool to build candidate blocks, so there would be another area of the code attempting to acquire `cs_main` via `BlockAssembler`\r\n\r\n- Another architectural approach other than a new thread and server for the Sv2 TP might be preferred such as the current work in the [multiprocess project](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Process-Separation)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\nTo run the Sv2 TP on this branch, Bitcoin needs to be configured with `./configure --enable-template-provider`.\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n\r\nIf there is sufficient approach/concept ACK or support in general. Then the below points are outstanding future work and existing nits.\r\n\r\nFuture work:\r\n\r\n- A noise implementation from the noise protocol framework needs to be introduced for secure communication between the Sv2 TP and downstream connections. The [noise spec for Sv2 has been reworked](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/04-Protocol-Security.md#43-choice-of-cryptographic-primitives) to accommodate resources currently available in core e.g. `secp256k1` and `BIP 340 schnorrsig`\r\n\r\n- There are current working changes proposed to the Sv2 TP spec, to allow downstream connections to send shorttxid  sets, allowing miners/downstream connections to present their own tx sets \r\n\r\n- Perhaps the Sv2 TP should be adapted to current work in the Bitcoin Core architecture. The new thread has been helpful for testing against the current SRI stack, it seems like the server implementation can adapt easily to different architectural needs\r\n\r\nExisting/known nits:\r\n\r\n- The server implementation has no limit on the number of downstream connections, it needs to be added\r\n\r\n- There could be potential conflict with functional tests. The Sv2 TP responds to the best new block change by reaching into the mempool and building a new block for downstream. My guess is that it would be acceptable to disable the Sv2 TP when running functional tests that asserts mempool state and then enable the Sv2 TP when it needs to specifically run its functional tests\r\n\r\n- Getting the full merkle path is required in the [NewTemplate](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/07-Template-Distribution-Protocol.md#72-newtemplate-server---client) message. I noticed that this was previously possible with the old implementation that was moved to [merkle_test.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2026301405f83c925ca68db6a3cd5134ed619ca7/src/test/merkle_tests.cpp#L114) , the current implementation does an in-place calculation to just return the root.  I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions or insight to a preferred solution? e.g. Move back  the old functions from merkle_tests or write a new implementation?\r\n \r\nThank you to all who helped contribute to the process of building this branch including working on the SRI, using this branch for testing and refining the Sv2 specs.\r\n\r\nAny feedback or reviews from nits to overall approach would be very much appreciated.",

My guess is that it would be acceptable to disable the Sv2 TP when running functional tests that asserts mempool state and then enable the Sv2 TP when it needs to specifically run its functional tests\r\n\r\n- Getting the full merkle path is required in the [NewTemplate](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/07-Template-Distribution-Protocol.md#72-newtemplate-server---client) message. I noticed that this was previously possible with the old implementation that was moved to [merkle_test.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2026301405f83c925ca68db6a3cd5134ed619ca7/src/test/merkle_tests.cpp#L114) , the current implementation does an in-place calculation to just return the root.  I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions or insight to a preferred solution? e.g. Move back  the old functions from merkle_tests or write a new implementation?\r\n \r\nThank you to all who helped contribute to the process of building this branch including working on the SRI, using this branch for testing and refining the Sv2 specs.\r\n\r\nAny feedback or reviews from nits to overall approach would be very much appreciated.\r\n",
