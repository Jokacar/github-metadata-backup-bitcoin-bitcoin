          "title": "Serialization improvements",
          "body": "This PR improves correctness (removing potentially unsafe `const_cast`s) and flexibility of the serialization code.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is that use of the current `ADD_SERIALIZE_METHODS` macro (which is the only way to not duplicate serialization and deserialization code) only expands to a single class method, and thus can only be qualified as either const or non-const - not both. In many cases, serialization needs to work on const objects however, and preferably that is done without casts that could hide const-correctness bugs.\r\n\r\nTo deal with that, this PR introduces a new approach that includes a `SERIALIZE_METHODS(obj)` macro, where `obj` is a variable name. It expands to some boilerplate and a static method to which the object itself is an argument. The advantage is that its type can be templated, and be `const` when serializing.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is the various serialization-wrapping macros (`VARINT`, `COMPACTSIZE`, `FLATDATA` and `LIMITED_STRING`). They all `const_cast` their argument in order to construct a wrapper object, which supports both serialization and deserialization. This PR makes them templated in the underlying data type (for example, `CompactSizeWrapper<uint64_t>`). This has the advantage that we can make the template type `const` when invoked on a `const` variable (so it would be `CompactSizeWrapper<const uint64_t>` in that case).\r\n\r\nA last issue is the persistent use of the `REF` macro to deal with temporary expressions being passed in. Since C++11, this is not needed anymore as temporaries are explicitly represented as rvalue references. Thus we can remove `REF` invocations and instead just make the various classes and helper functions deal correctly with references.\r\n\r\nThe above changes permit a fully const-correct version of all serialization code. However, it is cumbersome. Any existing `ADD_SERIALIZE_METHODS` instances in the code that do more than just (conditionally) serializing/deserializing some fields (in particular, it contains branches that assign to some of the variables) need to be split up into an explicit `Serialize` and `Unserialize` method instead. In some cases this is inevitable (wallet serializers do some crazy transformations while serializing!), but in many cases it is just annoying duplication.\r\n\r\nTo improve upon this, a few more primitives that are currently inlined are turned into serialization wrappers:\r\n* `BigEndianWrapper`: Serializes/deserializes an integer as big endian rather than little endian (only for 16-bit). This permits the CService serialization to become a oneliner.\r\n* `Uint48Wrapper`: Serializes/deserializes only the lower 48 bits of an integer (used in BIP152 code).\r\n* `VectorApplyWrapper`: Serializes/deserializes a vector while using a custom serializer for its elements. This simplifies the undo and blockencoding serializers a lot.\r\n\r\nBest of all, it removes 147 lines of while code adding a bunch of comments (though the increased use of vararg `READWRITE` is probably cheating a bit).\r\n\r\nThe commits are ordered into 3 sections:\r\n* First, introduce new classes that permit const-correct serialization.\r\n* Then one by one transform the various files to use the new serializers.\r\n* Finally, remove the old serializers.\r\n\r\nThis may be too much to go in at once. I'm happy to split things up as needed.",

          "body": "Messages in Bitcoin are structured, so a fuzzer that was written on structured data might be practically more efficient than our current \"blind\" fuzzers. https://github.com/google/libprotobuf-mutator looks like a good place to start. The goal of this issue is to write one (or more) fuzzers that are based on structured input data. For example, a transaction or PSBT could be expressed in a structured way and fed into the existing tx or psbt fuzz paths.\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful skills: Background in fuzzing and structured data formats\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nWant to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this. You are encouraged to comment on the issue if you are planning to work on it. This will help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed and is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
