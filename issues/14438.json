          "title": "Make UnitE an awesome open source project",
          "body": "*What does it take to make UnitE an awesome open source project? This document is a combination of brain dump and what I learned so far. There is certainly still a lot missing. I'm putting it up here for feedback and further refinement. We need to identify what the most urgent tasks are, prioritize them, and get them done.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\n* Run UnitE as an open source project according to highest standards\r\n* Make development transparent to the public\r\n* Be open for contributions and create a diverse and distributed community of contributors\r\n* Maintain a welcoming, pragmatic, fun culture focused on getting things done\r\n* Quality over quantity\r\n* Nurture an ecosystem of projects around UnitE\r\n* Build an engaged user community\r\n\r\n\r\n## Governance\r\n\r\nPurpose and direction of the project need to be clear to everyone. This can be captured in some vision or mission document.\r\n\r\nTone and culture of a project are critical to its success in attracting and retaining users and contributors. The most important part is to live the culture by example, be open, be welcoming, be kind. A code of conduct can help to make some part of the culture explicit and have something as guide in case of conflicts.\r\n\r\nDecisions have to be taken. Generally, decision making should be delegated as much as possible. There are still things which need some authority to be decided, e.g. what goes into the main branch of the code, what and when is released. That's what maintainers are responsible for.\r\n\r\n*It might be worth looking into more broad, more participative decision making in the future, especially for more general decisions and decisions which go beyond just the code.*\r\n\r\n### Governance elements\r\n\r\n* Project vision (keep it simple)\r\n* Code of Conduct (Examples: [KDE Code of Conduct](https://www.kde.org/code-of-conduct/), [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/))\r\n* Maintainers (define and document who maintainers are and how they are selected, how is access to the git repo managed, who has access, how to get access, put it in a MAINTAINERS.md file)\r\n* License policy\r\n  * MIT for code\r\n    * License file ([COPYING](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/blob/master/COPYING))\r\n    * License headers in each file\r\n  * CC-BY-SA for text and documentation specific to the UnitE project\r\n  * CC-0 for data and text to be used by others\r\n* No contributor agreement, i.e. inbound=outbound\r\n* Use [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/)?\r\n\r\n### *Suggestions*\r\n\r\n* Simple maintainer model where core team is collectively maintaining the core code and selects other maintainers\r\n* Make sure that all material is licensed properly so that it can be reused by others\r\n* Document policies contributors are expected to follow\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nCore and starting point is the development of the software. Everything else builds on top of that, users, contributors, scaling the community.\r\n\r\n### Development process\r\n\r\nIdeally there is one documented development process which works the same for everybody, core contributors as well as external contributors.\r\n\r\nA good part of the process is already defined by the current practices and by what is inherited from the Bitcoin development process (see Bitcoin Core's [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)). This might need some adaption where we feel the need to improve on what is there.\r\n\r\n#### Git repository\r\n\r\nThe central place for development is GitHub and the core code repository ([dtr-org/unit-e](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e)). It's currently private but will be made public when we are ready to launch. Work on it like it would already be public in terms of what you put in there.\r\n\r\n#### Contributing guidelines\r\n\r\nThe [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file is the central place to document the development process. There is a [great template](https://github.com/nayafia/contributing-template) for what should be covered there.\r\n\r\nThe CONTRIBUTING.md file should cover all the following sections of the development process.\r\n\r\n#### Tracking work\r\n\r\nWork is tracked in GitHub [issues](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/pulls). Keeping discussions there (or at least referencing them from there) keeps them close to the code and creates transparency.\r\n\r\nGitHub [milestones](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/milestones) are used to group and schedule work and [labels](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/labels) to classify issues.\r\n\r\nThere are templates for issues and pull request which help to make sure that the quality of new ones is high and required information is there. This is especially useful for new and external contributors but can also serve as a reminder and guideline for everybody.\r\n\r\n#### Architectural decisions\r\n\r\nArchitectural decisions are taken and documented using the [Architecture Decision Record](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e-docs/tree/master/adrs) framework. See [ADR-1](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e-docs/blob/master/adrs/2018-08-16-ADR-1%20Adopt%20ADR.md) for more details.\r\n\r\n#### Coding style\r\n\r\nThe code follows the [Google C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).\r\n\r\nIdeally there is some automatic check of the style so that there is a clear baseline and for example code reviews don't have to deal with nitpicking on style. That takes out a whole dimension of issues and discussions.\r\n\r\n#### Upstream integration\r\n\r\n[UnitE](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e) is a code fork of [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin). The Bitcoin Core code is copied and adapted to the UnitE namings through [clonemachine](https://github.com/dtr-org/clonemachine). Then it is merged with the UnitE specific changes. This is eventually repeated when a new version of Bitcoin Core is released. Not all releases are merged.\r\n\r\nPossible improvements to the cloning process:\r\n\r\n* [Refinements of cloning](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22upstream+sync%22)\r\n* [Format code according to style guide](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/issues/60)\r\n* Make sure docs reflect UnitE and not refer to Bitcoin Core, especially when it's about URLs or other pointers\r\n* CI which does regular runs of clonemachine so that changes in Bitcoin Core which break clonemachine or will cause exceptional work for the merge are detected early\r\n* Document best practices to avoid creating merge problems (such as using adaptors or structuring files so that they don't create conflicts)\r\n\r\n#### Commit guidelines\r\n\r\nGuidelines covering:\r\n\r\n* Content of commits\r\n* Style of commit messages\r\n* What meta info to put into commits such as git trailers, references, GitHub commands\r\n* If and how to sign commits\r\n* Structuring pull request\r\n* What history to keep and what to squash\r\n\r\n#### Review process\r\n\r\nHow to review pull requests, conventions for asking for review and how to give feedback and approval or disapproval. This mostly follows the upstream conventions.\r\n\r\nAll changes have to go through review by at least one other developer.\r\n\r\nAll changes need to have successful CI runs before they can be merged. This is integrated in the pull request process via the GitHub APIs.\r\n\r\nThe list of mandatory tests run on pull requests needs to be defined.\r\n\r\n#### Git branches\r\n\r\nOn which branches to work, release, stable, integration, development branches.\r\n\r\n#### Bug reports and feature requests\r\n\r\nBugs should be reported as GitHub issues or fixed directly in pull requests if trivial enough.\r\n\r\nFeature request should be reported as GitHub issues as well and go through a similar process.\r\n\r\nWith raising volume of issues we need to define an approach to triaging bugs.\r\n\r\n### Developer tooling\r\n\r\nTooling for developers to work on the code. *Needs more details.*\r\n\r\n* Build environment\r\n* Local test setup\r\n* [CI](https://travis-ci.com/dtr-org/unit-e) (a subset should run on pull requests as well to give early feedback, badges about state of CI should be shown in README)\r\n* Bots, doing mundane tasks such as checking style and formatting, keeping track of issues, etc. Bots need a bit of an identity so that it's clear what they do, who has control, etc. There are teams who [treat bots as team members](https://media.ccc.de/v/ASG2017-130-cyborg_teams).\r\n* Test network for tests in a production-like scenario\r\n\r\n### Releases\r\n\r\nIt's all about shipping, so the release process is central and crucial. The UnitE release process will inherit parts from the [Bitcoin release process](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-process.md) but be improved and adapted to our needs.\r\n\r\nThings to be taken care of:\r\n\r\n* Changelog, release notes (Bitcoin does it nicely. e.g. their [0.17.0 release notes](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.17.0))\r\n* Versioning, need to agree on a scheme, [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) is a popular one\r\n* Building release artifacts, binaries to be distributed to users on the various platforms in as native form as possible. This might for example involve packaging for Linux distributions.\r\n* Reproducible builds (Bitcoin uses [Gitian](https://gitian.org/)) to allow users to validate binary builds without having to trust a single entity\r\n* Release signing to give users a secure way to check where the release is coming from. Which keys to use? Where to run the signing?\r\n* On which platforms to release? Bitoin does arm, arm64, osx, osx64, win32, win64, linux-i686, linux-x86_64. Do we need 32 bit platforms? Can we start with a smaller set to keep build and test matrices small?\r\n* Public roadmap and release planning to make it transparent what is happening and what users can expect\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n\r\nSecurity issues need to be handled with special care.\r\n\r\n* Way to report security issues privately\r\n* CVE process?\r\n* Security bug bounties (e.g. work with [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/))\r\n\r\n### *Suggestions*\r\n\r\n* Document development process and tooling so that it's clear to all involved developers and can easily be used by new contributors\r\n* Set up pipeline to continuously create release artifacts (e.g. nightly) so that issues are detected early, the turnaround time on all kind of releases is short, and there is no fragility or bottlenecks introduced by manual steps\r\n\r\n\r\n## User community\r\n\r\nWe have released something. Now we will get users. This is why we are doing it. We want to make users happy, make sure they have a good experience with our software. We also want to have their feedback and input.\r\n\r\nWe also want users to become contributors. That's what is covered in the next section. Building the contributor funnel, turning users into contributors into maintainers.\r\n\r\n### User support and communication\r\n\r\nUsers will need a way to get support. The core team can help here at the beginning but the only way to scale that is to engage the community. \r\n\r\nThere is a study about [how the top 100 projects on GitHub do user support](https://github.com/nayafia/user-support). Running an own forum for user support seems to be the most popular option beyond GitHub issues. Other options are mailing lists, IRC, Gitter, Slack, or StackExchange.\r\n\r\nForums tend to work well for users, the other options work better for developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributor community\r\n\r\nContributions can come in many ways. People might contribute code as patches for bug fixes or new features. They also might contribute other things such as documentation, translations, web or graphical design. Or they engage in activities such as user support, bug triaging, promotion. Or they create and run projects which are related to UnitE but are not part of the core, such as additional web sites or services, or alternative clients, wallets, etc.\r\n\r\nWe do want to support all of that in a scalable and sustainable way.\r\n\r\nWe do want to provide users a path to become contributors and gradually take responsibility.\r\n\r\n### Responsiveness\r\n\r\nOne of the key factors in retaining new contributors is responsiveness. A [study by Mozilla](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hsJLv1ieSqtXBzd5YZusY-mB8e1VJzaeOmh8Q4VeMio/edit#slide=id.g43d857af8_0177) showed that contributors who got a response in less than 48 hours have an exceptionally high chance of continuing to contribute while contributors who waited more than 7 days almost never came back.\r\n\r\nWe need to track response times and work out mechanisms how to keep them low.\r\n\r\n### Mentoring\r\n\r\nOne of the most effective ways to get new contributors and to help to create a diverse community is mentoring. This can for example be done in the form of structuring and helping entry level tasks to be picked by new people or as more formal programs such as [Google's Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) or [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/).\r\n\r\n### Metrics\r\n\r\nThere is the German saying \"Wer viel misst, misst viel Mist\" (\"If you measure a lot you will measure a lot of crap\" or something like that) but there is some use for metrics to get insight into the community, become aware of trends, and have a way to evaluate changes and experiments on the community level.\r\n\r\nUseful metrics to watch:\r\n\r\n* Downloads (to measure popularity)\r\n* Number of contributors (to measure community size)\r\n* Number of contributors by affiliation (to measure community diversity)\r\n* Contributor retention (to have an indication for the openness and attractiveness of the project)\r\n* Contributors per area of the project (to identify areas which don't get enough attention)\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of tools around to do open source metrics, e.g.:\r\n\r\n* [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/)\r\n* [Stackalytics](http://stackalytics.com/)\r\n\r\n### Outreach\r\n\r\nThe word needs to be spread to engage people. Things to do there:\r\n\r\n* Creating and publishing content:\r\n  * Announcements\r\n  * Blogs\r\n  * Weekly reports about project activity\r\n* Organizing events\r\n  * Meetups\r\n  * Hackathons\r\n  * Conferences\r\n* Ambassador program to enable and recognize community members talking about the project\r\n* Office hours of the development team\r\n* Holding AMAs on Reddit\r\n* Merchandize\r\n  * Stickers\r\n  * T-Shirts\r\n  * ...\r\n* Press coverage\r\n* Interviews with core developers (such as [The people behind the code](https://github.com/open-source/stories))\r\n* ...\r\n\r\n### Outbound community engagement\r\n\r\nTo be a good citizen in the overall open source community and to benefit from the collaboration and input from the many smart people which are around there it's important to engage with other open source projects and the community in general. This is also very important for us to build a good reputation, which in the end is the currency of open source.\r\n\r\nOne effective way is to give back, to contribute to other projects, especially those we rely on. This can happen in various forms:\r\n\r\n* Contributing code or feedback to Bitcoin or other projects we directly rely on\r\n* Attending events of other community projects\r\n* Sponsoring events\r\n\r\nThe other effective way is spreading the word:\r\n\r\n* Talk at open source conferences such as [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2019/), [Open Source Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Summit), [OSCON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Open_Source_Convention) or on the many smaller events.\r\n* Talk at crypto conferences\r\n* Talk at meetups (where conveniently possible)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Scaling community\r\n\r\nIf we do things right we will have a growing community. How do we scale that? We do want valuable projects to be created around UnitE and we do want to increase the number of people involved beyond what we can directly handle in the core team.\r\n\r\nWe need to establish a way of cooperation which allows people to do their own work without the need to coordinate closely as it is needed when collaborating on the core software. This extends beyond the purely technical work.\r\n\r\nThings to look into:\r\n\r\n* Additional services (developed in cooperation or by the wider community or bootstrapped by the core team to allow others to build on it)\r\n  * Block tracker\r\n  * Node explorer\r\n  * Alternative clients\r\n  * Network statistics (see [Statoshi](https://statoshi.info/))\r\n* Support local groups, meetups\r\n* ...\r\n\r\n\r\n## Communication channels\r\n\r\nCommunication is essential and to support a growing, distributed community it needs appropriate communication channels.\r\n\r\nRoughly we need three different types of channels:\r\n\r\n* One way communication to the outside for announcements, documentation, etc.\r\n* Asynchronous bi-directional communication for questions, contributions which are not done in real-time\r\n* Synchronous bi-directional communication for direct interaction\r\n\r\nOne important decision is if we want to host infrastructure ourselves or we rely on third party services. A related question is if to rely on services based on proprietary software or if to insist on services based on free software which could be run by ourselves or others as well.\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\n* Home page and other web pages\r\n* GitHub (issues, pull requests)\r\n* Mailing lists (e.g. [Mailman](http://www.list.org/))\r\n* Forums\r\n* Chat\r\n  * [Slack](https://slack.com)\r\n  * [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) (open source Slack clone)\r\n  * [RocketChat](https://rocket.chat/) (open source Slack clone)\r\n  * [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)\r\n  * IRC (valued by the traditionalists)\r\n  * [Gitter](https://gitter.im/) (simple chat, which can easily be added to any repo, owned by GitLab, not too powerful)\r\n  * Video Chat\r\n    * [Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)\r\n    * [Appear.in](https://appear.in/)\r\n    * [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) (maybe the best video conferencing option right now, scales to large number of participants)\r\n\r\n### *Suggestions*\r\n\r\n* Keep as much communication as possible on GitHub so that it's in one place and can be managed without moving between channels\r\n* Use Slack for chat for the beginning as it's the most advanced tool, it's used by a number of high-profile open source communities such as Kubernetes, and we already use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation spans all areas of the project. There are two main target groups, users and contributors. There might be a third group with 3rd party developers using our technology but not contributing to the project itself. And there is a fourth area of documenting the project itself, that's kind of meta documentation, governance documents, etc.\r\n\r\nAccording to [GitHub's Open Source Survey in 2017](http://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/) documentation is highly valued but perceived as the number one issue in open source projects. Projects with great and up to date documentation set themselves apart as excellent examples.\r\n\r\nCreating documentation is essential but it's also essential to establish a low-barrier way for many people to contribute to documentation. Especially with many people contributing, keeping documentation structured takes effort, but it's worth it, because it keeps quality high (addressing the number one issue) and reduces the overall effort to maintain it (because there is less of a mess).\r\n\r\n### Documents\r\n\r\n* Developer documentation (part of git repo or hosted separately)\r\n  * Developer guides\r\n  * API and protocol documentation\r\n  * Code documentation (Doxygen generated)\r\n* User documentation\r\n  * Docs hosted separately\r\n  * Man pages\r\n* Repo README (central entry point for project)\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\n* [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) - Rendering and hosting documentation written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), published on push into git repo\r\n* [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/) - Tool to render AsciiDoc, which is similar to Markdown but more powerful (with power also comes some more complexity)\r\n* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - Popular static site generator, written for blogs, but can also be used for generic web sites and documentation\r\n* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - Static site generator, suitable for documentation, faster than Jekyll for big sites\r\n* [GitHub Wiki](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/) - GitHub's builtin Wiki backed by git, allows more informal contribution, harder to structure and review\r\n\r\n### *Suggestions*\r\n\r\n* Polish README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n* Keep developer documentation in-tree in the main git repo for the beginning\r\n* Create user documentation on ReadTheDocs\r\n* Get professional for at least proof-reading\r\n* Actively get feedback on docs and take corresponding actions to improve them\r\n\r\n\r\n## Funding\r\n\r\nThe project is funded right now. It might need some thinking about how to sustain that long-term. Some general thoughts about open source project funding are in [Nadya Eghbal's \"Lemonade Stand\"](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand).\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nReferences to some general guides and documents about running open source projects:\r\n\r\n* https://opensource.guide/\r\n* http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/\r\n",

At some point they branch off of master and start polishing, which is mostly finishing the release notes, generating man pages, etc. The release process is outlined in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-process.md\r\n\r\nPatches for CVEs are backported into the release branches (if applicable).\r\n\r\nHere is how their release schedule looks like: bitcoin/bitcoin#14438\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to follow a devel/master model (see for example one variant in [\"a successfull git branching model\"](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), we might want to use a simplified version, though). One advantage of using master to release from is that it's a stable branch name, so CI or other tooling doesn't have to be reconfigured for each release.\r\n\r\nA related aspect is how to handle work which is in progress. While we do want to encourage developers to submit code soon and often, stable branches should not be broken by unfinished code. Feature flags might be one way how to address this, so that code can mature on different schedules in the same branch, that might not work for all features, though.\r\n",

Set in #14725.\r\n\r\n#### [Qt Versions](https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt):\r\n[5.12 (LTS)](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.12/supported-platforms.html) Supported for 3 years post release.\r\n[5.11](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.11/supported-platforms.html) Supported until May 2019\r\n[5.10](https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-5.10/supported-platforms.html) Supported until Dec 2018 (Archived).\r\n[5.9 (LTS)](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.9/supported-platforms.html) Supported until May 31, 2020.\r\n[5.6 (LTS)](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.6/supported-platforms.html) Supported until Mar. 16, 2019 (will end around the same time as the `v0.18.0` release).\r\n\r\nAny other releases older than 5.10 are no longer supported (by Qt).\r\n\r\nQt releases seem to be getting more frequent, and in some cases more aggressive about dropping support for OS versions. i.e macOS >`10.12` is required for Qt `5.12`.\r\n\r\n#### Qt Feature Usage:\r\nThere are the following usages of `QT_VERSION` (excluding bitcoin_qt.m4) in the code:\r\n* [QT_VERSION >= 0x050600](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/bitcoin.cpp#L446) - 5.6+ Enables high-DPI scaling on supported platforms.\r\n\r\n* ~~[QT_VERSION >= 0x050500](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/bitcoin.cpp#L595) - 5.5+ Disable SSL and use TLS 1.0+.~~\r\n\r\n* [QT_VERSION < 0x050400](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/bitcoin.cpp#L58) // Import AccessibleFactory plugin.\r\n\r\n* [QT_VERSION >= 0x050300](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/test/rpcnestedtests.cpp#L123) - 5.3+ tests using QVERIFY_EXCEPTION_THROWN.\r\n\r\n* ~~[QT_VERSION >= 0x050200](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/guiutil.cpp#L64), [QT_VERSION >= 0x050200](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/guiutil.cpp#L94) - 5.2+ Returns the most appropriate system font.~~\r\n* ~~[QT_VERSION >= 0x050200](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/macdockiconhandler.mm#L59) - Set this menu to be the dock menu available by option-clicking on the application dock icon. macOS only.~~\r\n\r\n* ~~[QT_VERSION > 0x050100](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/bitcoin.cpp#L585) - 5.1+ Support for high-dpi pixmaps.~~\r\n* ~~[QT_VERSION > 0x050100](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/splashscreen.cpp#L39), [QT_VERSION > 0x050100](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/splashscreen.cpp#L55) - Sets the device pixel ratio for the splash-screen.~~\r\n\r\n* ~~[QT_VERSION >= 0x050000](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/paymentrequestplus.cpp#L100) - Determine if a certificate is blacklisted.~~ Removed in #13458.",
