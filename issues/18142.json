    "title": "Coordinate multi-sig wallet",
    "body": "Multiple people, or even just one person with multiple devices, want to setup a multi-sig wallet. The end result is a [descriptor wallet](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16528), perhaps [miniscript enhanced](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16800).\r\n\r\nProblem: how do you coordinate this setup? See Electrum thread about the same issue: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/5715\r\n\r\nBonus points: it should also work with a protocol like MuSig that requires more than one round of communication.\r\n\r\n## Current situation\r\n\r\nI made a [tutorial and screencast](https://nthkey.com/tutorial) of a setup flow, in this case using two signers: a ColdCard  and an iOs app that I'm working on. It's based on the flow ColdCard uses to setup a multisig between two of their devices. [Specter wallet](https://github.com/cryptoadvance) uses a similar flow and the same file format, last time I checked.\r\n\r\nThe general idea there is for each cosigner to export a (JSON) file with information about their public keys, and for the other signers to import that. Derivation paths are standardised (see also #16895). All participating devices will derive the same addresses; the user just needs to enter the (same) threshold on all devices.\r\n\r\nThe above is pretty easy to implement.\r\n\r\n## Flexible signer policies\r\n\r\nThe above approach requires everyone to contribute a single key. Individual participants can't do fancy stuff like having their own internal multisig setup or some backup key after a timeout. Yet this could be very useful, e.g. imagine a user with two hardware wallets who wants to use an external service provider as the third key. That service provider may have some super fancy setup, but they don't want to ship custom software to the user, let alone merge their special sauce into Bitcoin Core. What if you could use the Green Address service, but with your favourite orange QT wallet?\r\n\r\nA more flexible setup could use miniscript, where each participant provides a policy language snippet they want to use. These are then aggregated with `thresh(M, policy1, policy2, ... policyN)`. The result is then compiled by a coordinator (one of the participants) and shared with the others. Each participant could use a simple public key, or some super convoluted scheme. The cool thing about miniscript if that each participant can verify, without understanding the policy of the others, that they indeed control 1/Nth.\r\n\r\nIIUC the plan is to [combine](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16800) the powers of miniscript and output descriptors, and eventually add that to the wallet. Hopefully this allows for putting xpubs and origin info in both the policy language and the miniscript itself.\r\n\r\nThere is no current plan to add the policy language to miniscript compiler to Bitcoin Core, but we can start with a naive concatenation of participant miniscripts. Also AFAIK existing hardware wallets don't support anything other than plain OP_CHECKMULTISIG (`thresh_m(2, xpub1, xpub2, xpub3))` anyway.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we would use future proof syntax like the policy language, but in practice \"compile\" only to trivial, non-optimized, miniscript(s) that match what we can already do with descriptors.\r\n\r\n## Wallet composer file?\r\n\r\nWhat I have in mind is to (wait for someone else to) design a (binary) format, perhaps similar to PSBT, to compose a wallet interactively.\r\n\r\nIt would start with a coordinator. They populate the file with the \"shape\" of the wallet (YAML for illustrative purposes): \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- descriptor: null\r\n- policy: thresh(2, participant_1, participant_2, participant_3))\r\n- participant_1:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n- participant_2:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n- participant_3:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the first participant, probably the coordinator, fills in their details. They can also list their (advanced) capabilities, e.g. if they're able to decompile miniscript or only understand very basic policies.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- descriptor: null\r\n- policy: thresh(2, participant_1, participant_2, participant_3))\r\n- participant_1:\r\n   - policy: c:pk([00000000]/m/48h/0h/0h/2h/xpub_1/{0,1}/*)\r\n   - can_decompile_miniscript: false\r\n- participant_2:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n- participant_3:\r\n   - policy: null\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe file is then passed to participants 2 and 3. Participant 3 will have all the info it needs to construct a final descriptor (set), and it can prompt the user to \"commit\" to that wallet:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- descriptor: multi(2, [00000000]/m/48h/0h/0h/2h/xpub_1/{0,1}/*, ......)\r\n- policy: ...\r\netc...\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`{0,1}` is a fake descriptor syntax; for now you need a separate receive and change descriptor)\r\n\r\nEach participant needs to \"commit\" to the wallet, in the sense of storing it in their memory. This lets them display receive addresses, and it lets them check the change address before signing a transaction.\r\n\r\nIt then passes it to the other participants. If the devices all have screens, the user can now compare the first receive address as a sanity check.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core should be able to import this a watch-only descriptor wallet (or maybe it has one of the keys).\r\n\r\nIf any of the devices isn't smart / powerful enough to figure out the descriptor, then it needs to go back to the coordinator first. Conversely you could start with a round where each participant announces their capabilities (support for lock times, if they can decompile miniscript and understand their role in the top policy, taproot support, resource limits, etc). A coordinator can then propose a top level policy based on that.\r\n\r\nAdditional fields can be added e.g. to include nonces for a musig pubkey generation ritual. Also additional fields could contain friendly names for the participants.\r\n\r\nIdeally the whole thing is small enough to copy-paste or put in a QR code (e.g. bech32-ish encoded).",

          "title": "Need a way to represent a cosigner: (xfp, derivation prefix, xpub, script type)",
          "body": "_(This issue was in part split off from https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/5694 as it started to become off-topic there)_\r\n\r\nWhen handling PSBTs, signers will often want a derivation path prefix (\"derivation prefix\") for an xpub and the root xpub's fingerprint (\"xfp\"). This data is not contained in ypubs/zpubs. Hence, e.g. a wallet created from a zpub cannot create a PSBT that a coldcard will sign; and it's even worse in case of multisig wallets (see https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/5672#issuecomment-540790451).\r\n\r\nWe want to use PSBTs, and we want to use them for everything; as in all partial transactions will be serialized in the PSBT format.\r\n\r\nThere are two issues here.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### 1. We need a way to represent an xfp, a derivation prefix, and an xpub\r\n\r\n\r\nOne issue is that as xpubs don't contain the xfp and the derivation prefix, we need to change the wizard flow to show/expect something that does. I considered using [output script descriptors](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md) but turns out that does not work for this usecase: see https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/5694#issuecomment-543544564\r\nThe reason, briefly, is that an output descriptor can be used to describe a \"ready\" output, but not a partial one, which is what a cosigner would have during wallet creation.\r\n\r\nI would rather not come up with a completely custom serialization format for this, but use something that already exists. Except there isn't anything it seems. Well, there are output descriptors.\r\nSo we could reuse the format that appears there; which is a subpart of a descriptor; specifically, instead of an xpub we could have something like this:\r\n\r\n`[abcd0123/48h/0h/0h/2h]xpub661MyMwAqRbcFW31YEwpkMuc5THy2PSt5bDMsktWQcFF8syAmRUapSCGu8ED9W6oDMSgv6Zz8idoc4a6mr8BDzTJY47LJhkJ8UB7WEGuduB`\r\n\r\ni.e. an xpub prefixed with the xfp and the derivation prefix; to represent a cosigner.\r\n\r\nFurther note that we would like to still encode the script type **somewhere**; so the easiest thing for the moment would be to keep using the `{x,y,z,Y,Z}|{pub,prv}` stuff we've been using since 3.0.\r\nSo e.g.:\r\n\r\n`[abcd0123/48h/0h/0h/2h]Zpub69H7F5d8KSRgmmdJg2KhpAK8SR3DjMwAdkxj3ZuxV27CprR9LgpeyGmXUbC6wb7ERfvrnKZjXoUmmDznezpbZb7ap6r1D3tgFxHmwMkQTPH`\r\n\r\n(for illustrative purposes only; this ^ Zpub is not valid)\r\n\r\nThis is ~almost a subset of what the descriptor doc calls a `KEY` expression; except\r\n- that we would implicitly use this key to create a `x/0/i`, `x/1/j` subtree with the chains used for receiving and change addresses respectively\r\n- and that we would use y/z pubs instead of only what bip32 describes\r\n\r\n\r\nOne crucial observation is that the xpub itself, according to [bip32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#Serialization_format) contains:\r\n- the depth\r\n- fingerprint of direct parent\r\n- child index (last level in derivation prefix)\r\n\r\nWhich means that, if the xpub is at depth 0 or depth 1, both the root fingerprint and the derivation prefix can be calculated just from the xpub.\r\n\r\nHence, the wizard could accept:\r\n- prefixed xpubs\r\n- xpubs without prefix IF depth is either 0 or 1\r\n\r\nWhen showing a \"master public key\" to the user, we could do the same if we wanted,\r\n- either show prefixed xpubs in all cases\r\n- or maybe only show prefixed xpub if depth is not 0 or 1\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### 2. We need to upgrade existing wallets\r\n\r\nRegarding upgrading existing wallets:\r\n- Electrum seeds and xpubs corresponding to electrum seeds all use depth 0 or 1, hence they can be cleanly upgraded.\r\n- Hardware wallet keystores have the derivation prefix stored, but not the root fingerprint (existing hw wallets never needed this, except the coldcard, and they implemented storing this just for coldcard keystores from the get-go).\r\n    - We could conceivably implement a way where the user is asked to connect their hw device, or we just opportunistically wait for that to happen, and then we can learn this data from the hw device. Depending on exact details, I am not sure if there is a clean way without drawbacks of doing this.\r\n- Other bip32 keystores, including those generated from a bip39 seed, or those generated from an intermediate xprv or intermediate xpub, do not have either the root fingerprint or the derivation prefix stored currently.\r\n    - For bip39 seeds, we could prompt the user to enter their bip39 seed for a storage upgrade; or similar... Not ideal if it's mandatory (watch only???....). In any case, we cannot even tell if the wallet was derived from a bip39 seed at all; as that fact is not stored; and if it wasn't there might not even exist a bip39 seed that corresponds to the xpub.\r\n\r\nSo, for any bip32 keystore, exactly if the xpub depth is 0 or 1, we can reconstruct the missing data.\r\n\r\nFor the other cases, note that we could **fake** the xfp and the derivation prefix. See https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/5672#issuecomment-539547188\r\nFor example, we could set the master fingerprint to the fingerprint of the intermediate xpub, and fill the derivation prefix with `0xffff_ffff` ints. Note that, as above, from the xpub, the depth, the direct parent's fingerprint, and the child index can be read out, so it would be wise to fake the rest such that it is plausibly consistent with these fields.\r\nSpecifically, the last index in the derivation prefix should be set to the child index; and the depth should be consistent with the derivation prefix length.\r\nIf we do fake the missing data for these bip32 keystores, we should put a marker in the wallet file so that later we can tell we have done this.\r\n\r\nAn important thing to mention is that if we fake the data, basically all current usecases / user stories in Electrum supported currently should keep working. As the reason we don't have this data in the first place is that it was never needed before. Interoperability with other software via PSBTs might in some cases break however (but there was no interoperability before...).\r\n\r\n_(Although another point is that in the future, if e.g. Trezor starts using PSBTs in its wire protocol, they will want root fingerprints to be correct and at that point the wallet files for which we faked the xfp would stop working (if they are communicating with a Trezor device).)_\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis issue needs to be handled in **some** way as part integrating PSBT support into Electrum.\r\nThe reason I am concerned right now, is that I have a ~private (WIP) branch that integrates PSBT support, atm it's a ~6k line diff, and it touches lots and lots and lots of parts of the code, and it is very prone to become conflicted with any change on master basically. Which means I would like my branch merged soonish, which means this issue needs to be handled.....\r\n\r\nWhat I currently suggest is to do the conclusion of point (1), i.e. to show prefixed xpubs to users; and re (2) to cleanly upgrade bip32 keystores if they are at depth 0 or depth 1 (all electrum seeds), and to fake the missing data for other bip32 keystores along with putting a marker in the wallet file to signal that we did the faking.",

      "body": "I'm pretty concerned about cross-device mutual authentication, and compromise of the computer that coordinates signing. I'm assuming a descriptor-based wallet is already used and devices are a \"little smarter\". How does one wallet device know that the other devices are doing what they're supposed to, and what attacks are possible because they don't? Since each device knows the pubkeys of all the others, those same keys can be used to bootstrap cross-device mutual authentication for the multisig signing set. The security of the assets is also a function of the coordinating wallet (online with UTXO set), which is kind of an invisible party to the security of the keys. Cross-device mutual authentication can solve the following problems:\r\n1. Has any device signed a transaction that the others didn't? (e.g. less than m keys in m-of-n have been compromised -- detect probing or failed attack)\r\n2. m of n operators can collude to create one extra transaction by signing two transactions per access to the signing device, and sharing the second transaction with the other m-1 operators. After m trips to cold storage signing legitimate transactions, they can create one extra arbitrary transaction that the coordinating computer (providing UTXOs) doesn't know about. (A single compromised operator with access to all m different signing devices, at different times, could accomplish the same thing)\r\n3. Have the devices been used to sign for forked coins or a 51% attack? (unexpectedly)\r\n4. Is the coordinating computer compromised (e.g. remove a threshold number of devices from the signing entity and take them to a different coordinating computer).\r\n\r\nPrivate communication channels between (offline) devices can generically be created using the SNICKER half-DH idea (if necessary -- but it seems like signatures might be sufficient), since each device knows the pubkeys of all the others. This can then be relayed, but not falsified by the coordinating computer. This creates an encrypted out-of-band communications channel between offline devices, to share whatever state is necessary to ensure that the data being fed to them is consistent across devices. The coordinating computer(s) is then holding some state, so kind-of is an epsilon participant in the (m+epsilon)-of-n wallet. I have two ideas that might be interesting:\r\n1. A rolling state hash: each device maintains an \"epoch\" hash defined as `h_{epoch} = hash(h_{epoch-1}|serialized_transaction)`. After signing, each device updates its epoch hash and *signs* the new epoch hash for relay to the other devices. Devices excluded from signing but used later (n-m of those) can be relayed the entire history of signing by the coordinating computer (or another signing device).\r\n2. UTXO set accumulator: each device can be fed the set of known/available UTXOs for storage. When one is spent, it removes it from its memory (and could refuse to sign a double-spend if desired). The device refuses to sign unknown UTXOs (forked coins). NiPoWPoW can be used to prevent falsifying the UTXO set.\r\n\r\nOne could define a BIP32 key path for mutual device authentication or half-DH/SNICKER encrypted communication.\r\n\r\nIt might be interesting to consider whether such \"rolling state\" could be used as entropy for determining the k value in MuSig. I'd love to kill that extra round of communication...\r\n\r\nWhat other attack vectors can be mitigated by giving offline devices an encrypted communications channel, and do you think this is valuable enough to implement?",

For many wallet types you can derive all future addresses during setup. PSBT can be expanded for things that happen before / during / after signing.\r\n\r\nOther wallet types, like Lightning, can't derive addresses at wallet generation. Some of that information can piggy-back in PSBTs as most steps in the lightning protocol involve generating a new transaction. But maybe interactive addresses generating requires yet another mechanism.",

For not connected external signers it's also possible to manually provide an xpub.\r\n\r\nUse `enumeratesigners` to get a list of device fingerprints, and then call the new `createmultisigwallet `:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreatemultisigwallet \"wallet_name\" threshold [\"fingerprint\",\"xpub1\",\"xpub2\",...] ( avoid_reuse )\r\n\r\nCreates and loads a new multisig wallet.\r\nOnly native segwit bech32 addresses are supported.\r\nArguments:\r\n1. wallet_name           (string, required) The name for the new wallet.

Draft / compose: enter recipient, amount, fees, etc. (the current Send screen).\r\n\r\nThis step is skipped when loading a PSBT (e.g. via menu: Transaction -> Load, or a smart clipboard).\r\n\r\n2. Sign: currently a popup which confirms the details. With hardware wallets (e.g. #16549) this should enumerate connected wallets and let you sign one by one. In a multisig situation it should detect if any signatures are missing, and rename the 3rd step to \"Export\".\r\n\r\n3. Finish / Export: once again repeat the importantant details. For basic wallets with private keys in it, this should just show that the transaction has been broadcast. With a completed PSBT it should let the user choose between broadcasting or exporting (clipboard, save to disk).",

The specification in the link above allows hardware wallets to share details of a particular BIP44 account they can sign for.

This allows the co-ordinator to select the appropriate output descriptor depending on the script type for the wallet it is creating, and then add the device to the multisig setup.",

This is where the same keyset  is used for two different multisigs. It isn't as dangerous as address reuse, but it does mean compromise of one keyset's private key also compromises all multisig account descriptors that it is used with.\r\n\r\nCurrently Gordian Signer (a multisig signing-only app) doesn't store seeds, but instead using offline airgapped tools like LetheKit to derive the xprv/xpub. But we do have to store state as to what keysets have been offered to other multisig descriptors. I'd really like to see a standard approach on how to manage against keyset reuse to enable interoperability and portability.",

In general, all the Gordian apps (wallet, signer, coordinator, server, etc.) are explicitly descriptor and multisig-centric — we are even considering dropping single sig. They also all are able to be airgapped and torgapped based on different security models.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-macOS\r\nhttps://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Android\r\nhttps://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Catalyst\r\nhttps://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-keytool-cli\r\n\r\nAll of the above can already sign PSBTs, including animated QRs for large PSBTs, but the important design question is a standard way to accept a policy request (\"will you participate in a 3 of 5 with a timelock to 2 of 3\"), and if that is acceptable offer a keyset (e.g. [d34db33f/48'/0'/19']xpub6ERApfZwUNrhLCk…\", and hopefully get an account map back (an account map is a descriptor with no xprvs in it]. \r\n",

      "body": "So if my understanding is correct, the BCR-2020-015 standard offers an array for all script types, because the use case is for the offline signer to supply the coordinator with all the information that might be needed (the coordinator will then choose the one descriptor that is necessary to create the wallet).  That seems superfluous.  Why not have the coordinator start the creation process, send a 'policy request', and get a 'keyset' back like @ChristopherA  talked about? That seems much nicer, no?  The coordinator could then transfer 'account maps' to all offline signers.\r\n\r\nBesides that, a concern I have with BCR-2020-015 is the use of 'BIP48', which isn't actually a standard.\r\n\r\nIs there a BCR in process for policy requests or account maps? I guess that's why we're all here.",

They result in key reuse with multsigs, which I believe to be a bad idea. Less risky than address reuse, but still an issue.\r\n\r\nI also don’t like that you can’t create sub-accounts like you can with single-sig.\r\n\r\nI’m fine with a multisig coordinator suggesting a a specific path, but it should be able to handle when it is returned a keyset “[m fingerprint/path]xpub” — it may have already given that path to another multisig.

All signers will need to know all other signers info to securely sign PSBTs (@benma has done good research on this). So this means the coordinator will need to send account maps back to all signers after creation of the wallet (last step).\r\n\r\nIf we create the wallet your way (BCR-2020-015), there may be redundant information, but it means there are only 2 data exchanges.  Signers send the BIP 44 arrays, the coordinator creates the wallet, and sends back to the signers all the account maps.\r\n\r\nMy proposed way would require 3 data exchanges. (Coordinator proposes wallet to signers, signers send back specific BIP44 descriptor, then coordinator sends back account maps).",

      "body": "@ghost43 There does not seem to be any “sub-account” (not 0 but 1+) capability for this using the same xpubs. Is that correct? \r\n\r\nAs I interpret the difference between a BIP44 definition of account, vs its usage in multisig under 48, the possessor of an xpub level -1 in BIP48 can create and watch all sub-accounts. This is not true under 48, as each account may have different other xpubs involved in their descriptors, thus can’t watch them.\r\n\r\nRelated, how does Electrum increment its account to prevent xpub reuse? Do you have some state that increments for each multisig you has been requested?",

This is not true under 48, as each account may have different other xpubs involved in their descriptors, thus can’t watch them.\r\n\r\nYou misunderstand BIP44 then. Even in BIP44, you cannot generate the public keys for multiple accounts from any xpub. xpubs are only possible for specific accounts, not across accounts. See [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/7e13d23d4339e5704f3c12d88704ee7520d16149/bip-0032.mediawiki#public-parent-key--private-child-key) (note that the account level is hardened in both \"purpose48\" and BIP44).",

(benma from bitbox expressed interest but said they were busy with other things and had not had time to look into multisig yet. johoe ~from trezor had constructive feedback, see linked issue. No response from ledger.) I have also tried to find other wallets besides Electrum that supported multisig and at least had segwit on the roadmap, to solicit feedback, but could not find any.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to get your input (and anyone else here!) to help make BIP48 a reality, I have gone ahead and essentially modified bip44 to what my interpretation of what a bip48 would look like [https://github.com/Fonta1n3/bips/blob/master/bip-0048.mediawiki](https://github.com/Fonta1n3/bips/blob/master/bip-0048.mediawiki). I am not interested in doing this on my own, but it needs to be done. Any feedback, contribution or proposal would be appreciated.",

          "body": "There has been incredible work implementing descriptor wallets, PSBTs, offline signing, HWWs; and GUI support for it all into Bitcoin Core.  It has been incredibly exciting to watch!\r\n\r\nMy goal is to financially support developers to implement offline multisignature wallets into Bitcoin Core.  I believe we are almost there.\r\n\r\nI am here to humbly try to attempt to describe what I see, as a user and through talks with other developers, as the work that is needed to implement secure, offline multisignature wallets in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n1) A standard for Coordinating Multisignature Wallets, with an authentication scheme.  This is being discussed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18142).\r\n\r\nBlockchainCommons has done a lot of work around this:\r\n\r\nOnline Node Coordinator sends a 'Policy Request' to Offline Co-Signers, if acceptable, co-signers send a 'Keyset', and then get an 'Account Map' back.\r\n\r\nPolicy Request = empty descriptor\r\n\r\nKeyset = BIP48 path\r\n\r\nAccount Map = descriptor w/ no xprvs in it\r\n\r\nAND/OR\r\n\r\nCo-Signers send array of descriptors for all script types ([BCR-2020-015](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-015-account.md)) to Coordinator, Coordinator selects necessary descriptor and creates wallet, then sends 'Account Map' back.\r\n\r\nConcerns:  lack of complete standardization.  use of BIP48.  Names still up in the air.\r\n\r\n@Sjors also discussed the possibility of a 'Wallet Composer File' that could compose a wallet interactively, use future-proof syntax (can the signer decompile miniscript?), and support other capabilities.  Not sure how much work has been done on this.\r\n\r\n1 A)  The authentication:\r\n\r\nJust trust on first use, with warnings if data changes?  @benma has done great research and reporting on this:\r\n\r\nTo receive securely, the offline signers need to be able to verify the following:\r\n\r\n> The receive address, which has to encode the hash of an ordinary multisig redeem script with no other spending conditions\r\n> The key of the hardware wallet, which has to be one of the public keys in the redeem script\r\n> The keypath of the displayed address in order to avoid ransom attacks if no restrictions are enforced by the hardware wallet\r\n> The number of cosigners in order to prevent an attacker from adding more\r\n> The threshold of required signatures to not be higher or lower than intended\r\n> The xpubs of the cosigners in order to prevent an attacker from swapping them\r\n\r\nThe above is written for hardware wallets, but I believe any BIP written and code implemented should be for both HWWs and offline Core wallets.  With descriptor wallets, I believe a lot of the above authentication can be automated by the info in the Account Map that all offline co-signers have.\r\n\r\nTo send securely, the offline signers need to be able to verify the following:\r\n\r\n> The recipient’s address, displayed and confirmed by the user like with singlesig\r\n> The change address, having the same cosigners and threshold in an ordinary multisig script with no other spending conditions\r\n> The change goes to an address at a keypath recoverable by the user\r\n\r\nI think all the above is very important, since there have been many instances of devices not properly implementing the above security measures, so having a BIP for devices/software to comply with would be important.\r\n\r\n\r\n@Sjors and @achow101 have been doing a ton of work integrating HWWs.  This looks like it will be merged soon: (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16546).  After that, the UI will be worked on (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/4), and there is a currently-closed PR for HWW multisig functionality on top (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16895).  Perhaps some of this code can be re-used for multisig with Core on offline computers, but I am not sure.\r\n\r\nI believe having this ability would be an extensive security gain (being able to create a multisig wallet with Core on offline computers through the GUI).\r\n\r\n\r\n2)  Represent multiple derivation paths with one descriptor (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190)\r\n\r\nSingle descriptors make creating, backing up, and restoring multisignature wallets much simpler.  For example:\r\n\r\nTo create a multisignature wallet in Bitcoin Core, you can currently:\r\n\r\n1. Create wallet\r\n2. Dump `hdseed`\r\n3. Create address, dump xpriv\r\n4. Repeat Steps 1-3 N times\r\n5. Create multisig wallet using descriptor containing all N xprvs (M of N multisig)\r\n6. Use the N `hdseed`s along with Account Map as backup\r\n\r\nHowever, the above wallet can not create change addresses.  You need to create (backup and restore) a second descriptor for change addresses, even though most of the descriptor is the same, except for the derivation path at the end.  This can be very time consuming/confusing for end users, especially when backing up by paper/hand.\r\n\r\nFor a comprehensive offline multisignature wallet, I believe this change needs to be implemented.  Currently in Yeti, we bypass this by recommending coin control and only sending entire UTXO's (which is a pretty bad user experience and short term solution we have chosen).\r\n\r\nSome users like setting custom change descriptors (for example, for sending to an application for mixing change) so I believe this should be able to be done behind expert options, and perhaps this makes a single descriptor less controversial.\r\n\r\n\r\n3)  QR code scanner (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/9913)\r\n\r\nQR codes are the most secure way to pass data between airgapped signers.  I currently have a $300 bounty on implementing this.  BlockchainCommons has a standard ([BCR-2020-005](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md)) that is compatible with PSBTs (multiple QR codes checksummed; or a single animated QR code), and has a C++ reference implementation (https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur).\r\n\r\n\r\n4)  After the above (1-3) is finished, I believe implementing offline multisignature wallets into Bitcoin Core will be possible.\r\n\r\nI am not trying to influence consensus (this should just be wallet code), and ultimately it is of course up to the developers and the community if these are changes that are good for Bitcoin, and if the above is how it should be implemented.  I am just trying to put all the thoughts/discussions down in one place.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopers who might be interested:\r\n\r\n@Sjors @gwillen @instagibbs @achow101 \r\n\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nI, Robert Spigler, am offering a $1,500 bounty for implementing 1, 2, 3, and 4 (standard for coordination of co-signers, single descriptors, QR codes, and offline multisignature wallets) in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nThis does not include the already existing $300 bounty for #3 (QR codes).\r\n\r\nThe bounty will be split between developers as I see most fair (author and substantial reviews/discussions).\r\n\r\nThe bounty has no expiration and will be paid in bitcoin.\r\n\r\nThe date is 2021-02-02.\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n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\r\nYGS81OAQfIV/MJFffSJ581uU6th1s+7g9nWjeT9vGqTSJbNd1P4=\r\n=Xm2a\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n",
