In both cases `push_back` and `emplace_back` should call the move constructor when adding it to the `result` vector.",

In order to do that, SFFO logic needs to be moved out of `FundTransaction` up to the RPCs.\r\n\r\nAs a secondary motivation, this PR moves the SFFO stuff closer to the caller, making the code cleaner and easier to understand. This (hopefully) makes the eventual deprecation of SFFO easier (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24142 for motivation)\r\n\r\nI'm also not convinced we need to pass a full `CMutableTx` object to `FundTransaction`, but I'm leaving that for a follow-up PR/discussion.",

This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

          "title": "wallet: Keep track of the wallet's own transaction outputs in memory",
          "body": "Currently, the wallet is not actually aware about its own transaction outputs. Instead, it will iterate all of the transactions stored in `mapWallet`, and then all of the outputs of those transactions, in order to figure out what belongs to it for the purposes of coin selection and balance calculation. For balance calculation, there is caching that results in it only iterating all of the transactions, but not all of the outputs. However when the cache is dirty, everything is iterated. This is especially problematic for wallets that have a lot of transactions, or transactions that have a lot of unrelated outputs (as may occur with coinjoins or batched payments).\r\n\r\nThis PR helps to resolve this issue by making the wallet track all of the outputs that belong to it in a new member `m_txos`. Note that this includes outputs that may have already been spent. Both balance calculation (`GetBalance`) and coin selection (`AvailableCoins`) are updated to iterate `m_txos`. This is generally faster since it ignores all of the unrelated outputs, and it is not slower as in the worst case of wallets containing only single output transactions, it's exactly the same number of outputs iterated.\r\n\r\n`m_txos` is memory only, and it is populated during wallet loading. When each transaction is loaded, all of its outputs are checked to see if it is `IsMine`, and if so, an entry added to `m_txos`. When new transactions are received, the same procedure is done.\r\n\r\nSince imports can change the `IsMine` status of a transaction (although they can only be \"promoted\" from watchonly to spendable), all of the import RPCs will be a bit slower as they re-iterate all transactions and all outputs to update `m_txos`.\r\n\r\nEach output in `m_txos` is stored in a new `WalletTXO` class. This class contains references to the parent `CWalletTx` and the `CTxOut` itself. It also caches the `IsMine` value of the txout. This should be safe as `IsMine` should not change unless there are imports. This allows us to have additional performance improvements in places that use these `WalletTXO`s as they can use the cached `IsMine` rather than repeatedly calling `IsMine` which can be expensive.\r\n\r\nThe existing `WalletBalance` benchmark demonstrates the performance improvement that this PR makes. The existing `WalletAvailableCoins` benchmark doesn't as all of the outputs used in that benchmark belong to the test wallet. I've updated that benchmark to have a bunch of unrelated outputs in each transaction so that the difference is demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a larger project to have the wallet actually track and store a set of its UTXOs.\r\n\r\nBuilt on #24914 as it requires loading the txs last in order for `m_txos` to be built correctly.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks:\r\n\r\nMaster:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       92,245,141.50 |               10.84 |    0.1% |  988,823,975.00 |  66,803,340.50 |    0.0% |      2.04 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            5,709.90 |          175,134.50 |    0.5% |       80,968.24 |      25,539.15 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|          139,396.17 |            7,173.80 |    0.6% |    1,383,390.50 |     430,276.86 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            5,055.80 |          197,792.47 |    0.3% |       80,968.10 |      25,539.02 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|                9.79 |      102,152,396.19 |    0.1% |          161.00 |          37.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,552,736.00 |              644.02 |    1.5% |   20,316,315.80 |     618,545.80 |    0.6% |      0.08 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|      114,114,732.00 |                8.76 |    0.5% |1,291,047,717.60 | 320,244,602.00 |    0.0% |      6.30 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      359,315,754.00 |                2.78 |    0.1% |4,339,447,818.00 | 136,619,757.00 |    0.7% |      1.80 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|       98,230,601.00 |               10.18 |    0.1% |  537,688,964.00 |  97,332,266.00 |    0.3% |      0.49 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n\r\nPR:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       75,319,868.50 |               13.28 |    0.2% |  863,758,229.00 |  30,892,593.00 |    0.2% |      1.66 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            2,367.62 |          422,364.95 |    1.0% |       35,785.05 |       9,893.01 |    0.2% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|            2,685.58 |          372,359.55 |    0.2% |       36,501.05 |      10,027.01 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            3,462.24 |          288,830.68 |    2.7% |       35,785.06 |       9,893.01 |    0.3% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|               11.65 |       85,838,176.97 |    0.1% |          180.00 |          42.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,563,092.60 |              639.76 |    1.5% |   20,426,154.40 |     649,953.80 |    0.6% |      0.09 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|       58,367,804.40 |               17.13 |    0.9% |  587,164,005.00 | 107,905,843.80 |    0.1% |      3.21 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      365,302,636.00 |                2.74 |    0.2% |4,349,345,147.00 | 138,730,668.00 |    0.8% |      1.83 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|      124,995,585.00 |                8.00 |    1.2% |  801,998,316.00 | 103,210,721.00 |    0.3% |      0.63 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n",

          "body": "Miniscript was targeting P2WSH, and as such can currently only be used in `wsh()` descriptors. This pull request introduces support for Tapscript in Miniscript and makes Miniscript available inside `tr()` descriptors. It adds support for both watching *and* signing TapMiniscript descriptors.\r\n\r\nThe main changes to Miniscript for Tapscript are the following:\r\n- A new `multi_a` fragment is introduced with the same semantics as `multi`. Like in other descriptors `multi` and `multi_a` can exclusively be used in respectively P2WSH and Tapscript.\r\n- The `d:` fragment has the `u` property under Tapscript, since the `MINIMALIF` rule is now consensus. See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24906.\r\n- Keys are now serialized as 32 bytes. (Note this affects the key hashes.)\r\n- The resource consumption checks and calculation changed. Some limits were lifted in Tapscript, and signatures are now 64 bytes long.\r\n\r\nThe largest amount of complexity probably lies in the last item. Scripts under Taproot can now run into the maximum stack size while executing a fragment. For instance if you've got a stack size of `999` due to the initial witness plus some execution that happened before and try to execute a `hash256` it would `DUP` (increasing the stack size `1000`), `HASH160` and then push the hash on the stack making the script fail.\r\nTo make sure this does not happen on any of the spending paths of a sane Miniscript, we introduce a tracking of the maximum stack size during execution of a fragment. See the commits messages for details. Those commits were separated from the resource consumption change, and the fuzz target was tweaked to sometimes pad the witness so the script runs on the brink of the stack size limit to make sure the stack size was not underestimated.\r\n\r\nExisting Miniscript unit, functional and fuzz tests are extended with Tapscript logic and test cases. Care was taken for seed stability in the fuzz targets where we cared more about them.\r\n\r\nThe design of Miniscript for Tapscript is the result of discussions between various people over the past year(s). To the extent of my knowledge at least Pieter Wuille, Sanket Kanjalkar, Andrew Poelstra and Andrew Chow contributed thoughts and ideas.",

          "body": "This contains everything to make mempool/validation logic ready for package relay (see #27463).\r\n\r\nDesign goals:\r\n- Be able to gracefully deal with any arbitrary list of transactions (these come from p2p)\r\n- Validate any ancestor package so that the incentive-compatible transactions end up in our mempool.\r\n  - If the transactions would be accepted individually, they should also be accepted through `AcceptPackage`. We don't want to accidentally reject things just because we happened to download them as a package.\r\n  - Bug prior to these changes: we required `IsChildWithParents` but if there were dependencies between the parents, we could end up (1) accepting a low-feerate child or (2) rejecting a high-feerate parent CPFPing another parent. See the \"interdependent parents\" test case for a specific example.\r\n- Be DoS-resistant.\r\n   - Avoid quadratic validation costs.\r\n   - Avoid loading a lot of stuff from disk, or loading repeatedly.\r\n\r\nA description of the package validation logic (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26711#issuecomment-1647523520):\r\n\r\n- Basic sanitization. Quit if it's too big, inconsistent, etc.\r\n- Linearize (Topological sort only)\r\n- **PreChecks loop** For each tx, grab UTXOs to calculate fees and filter out anything we should skip:\r\n    - If already in mempool (or same txid in mempool), mark as skip\r\n    - If missing inputs or conflict, record this failure and mark this and all descendants as skip.\r\n    - If no failures or TX_SINGLE_FAILURE, continue\r\n    - Otherwise, record this failure and mark that we will `quit_early`.\r\n- Refine our linearization using the fee information.\r\n- **Subpackage validation loop** For each transaction in the new linearized order:\r\n    - Get the transaction's ancestor subpackage.\r\n    - If the feerate of this transaction is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - If the feerate of this subpackage is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - Otherwise, try to submit the subpackage, using `AcceptSingleTransaction()` if it's just 1 tx\r\n    - if at any point we get a non-fee-related error, abort all.\r\n- Call `LimitMempoolSize`\r\n- Backfill results:\r\n    - If the transaction was in mempool, check to see if it's still there in case it was trimmed in `LimitMempoolSize`.\r\n    - Try to use results from the subpackage validation loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early), use results from prechecks loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early and we hadn't found a failure with it yet), fill with `TX_UNKNOWN`.\r\n\r\nThis means we will call `PreChecks` for each transaction 2 times (fewer if we quit early), and run all other validation checks at most 1 time. A transaction shouldn't be validated in the subpackage validation loop more than once.",

This means that `CreateTransaction` is actually unaware of any user desired locktime or sequence numbers. This can have an effect on whether and how anti-fee-sniping works.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `CreateTransaction` aware of the locktime and preset input data by providing them to `CCoinControl`. `CreateTransasction` will then set the sequences, scriptSigs, scriptWItnesses, and locktime as appropriate if they are specified. This allows `FundTransaction` to actually use `CreateTransaction`'s result directly instead of having to extract the parts of it that it wants.\r\n\r\nAdditionally `FundTransaction` will return a `CreateTransactionResult` as `CreateTransaction` does instead of having several output parameters. Lastly, instead of using `-1` as a magic number for the change output position, the change position is changed to be an optional with no value set indicating no desired change output position (when provided as an input parameter) or no change output present (in the result).",
