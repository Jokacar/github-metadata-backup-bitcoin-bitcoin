    "body": "See #27463 for overall package relay tracking. This PR is in draft while ancestor package validation is being figured out.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 2 projects: v3 policy and package RBF. Mailing list posts: [package RBF 1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019464.html) and [V3 + package RBF 2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html). It stems from a long discussion about RBF pinning, across a [mailing list thread](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html) and [gist](https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff).\r\n\r\nV3 Policy: A set of policy rules applied to transactions with their `nVersion` field set to 3. Namely, it allows users to opt in to more restrictive descendant limits for shared transactions. If adopted by many nodes in the network, V3 mitigates various RBF pinning attacks. See doc/policy/version3_transactions.md for the exact rules and rationale, and [these review club notes](bitcoincore.reviews/25038) for more background and discussion.\r\n\r\nPackage RBF: In addition to allowing a child to pay for its parents within the package, also allow the child to pay for replacing the parent's conflicts. For example, this allows LN users to replace commitment transactions existing in the mempool, simply by broadcasting their respective commitment transactions with a high-fee child. The commitment transactions can be signed with 0 fees, which means no overpaying.\r\n\r\nFAQ: is v3 still helpful even with cluster mempool (#27677) ?\r\n\r\n- Rule 3 pinning: This is addressed with v3 but not really with cluster mempool (descendant allowance is still too permissive).\r\n- Package RBF and ACP pinning: This PR allows for package RBF with v3 packages. V3 has an effective \"cluster limit\" of 2 which makes it very cheap to calculate the mining score of a v3 transaction. With cluster mempool, which also makes it easier to calculate mining score, we could have package RBF for non-v3 transactions.\r\n- Allowing 0fee transactions: This PR allows v3 transactions to be below minimum relay feerate, provided they are CPFP'd. This is because the simplified topology allows us to avoid situations like the ones described in #26933. With cluster mempool, we can allow this for non-v3 transactions.",

          "body": "This PR is a reattempt of #19645, which has been abandoned.\r\n\r\nCurrently, an existing mempool transaction can't be replaced by a transaction that's identical except for its witness (same txid, different wtxid); the request is rejected as a duplicate. This PR changes this behavior such that the mempool will replace the existing transaction if the new transaction has a smaller witness by at least 5% (an anti-Dos measure). The replacement transaction can't increase the fee (since its inputs and outputs cannot change), but it necessarily has a higher fee _rate_ than the existing transaction, since its overall size is lower. Miners should always prefer the replacement transaction.\r\n\r\nAn important difference between what this PR implements and the existing RBF (replace-by-fee, BIP125) is that the replacement can occur even if the original transaction is not marked as replaceable. This is because the replacement transaction will pay the same outputs as the transaction being replaced (identical txids ensures this), so the recipients of the existing transaction have no reason to fear not being paid by the replacement transaction. Unlike RBF, all of the existing transaction's descendants, if any, remain in the mempool.\r\n\r\nInitially, we'll limit this to single transactions (not packages); this can be reconsidered later.",

This PR adds a `-regtest` only RPC interface so people can test by submitting raw transaction data. It is regtest-only, as it would be unsafe/confusing to create an actual mainnet interface while package relay doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nNote that the functional tests are there to ensure the RPC interface is working properly; they aren't for testing policy itself.

It also handles removing the snapshot chainstate data on-disk in the event that the snapshot fails to validate.\r\n\r\nAs detailed in [assumeutxo.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/assumeutxo.md#background-chainstate-hits-snapshot-base-block):\r\n\r\n> Once the tip of the background chainstate hits the base block of the snapshot chainstate, we stop use of the background chainstate by setting m_stop_use, in CompleteSnapshotValidation(), which is checked in ActivateBestChain()). We hash the background chainstate's UTXO set contents and ensure it matches the compiled value in CMainParams::m_assumeutxo_data.\r\n> \r\n> The background chainstate data lingers on disk until shutdown, when in ChainstateManager::Reset(), the background chainstate is cleaned up with ValidatedSnapshotShutdownCleanup(), which renames the chainstate_[hash] datadir as chainstate.\r\n>\r\n> **Failure consideration**: if bitcoind unexpectedly halts after m_stop_use is set on the background chainstate but before CompleteSnapshotValidation() can finish, the need to complete snapshot validation will be detected on subsequent init by ChainstateManager::CheckForUncleanShutdown().\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n~~Most of this change is unittested, though some logic (anything assuming on-disk leveldb data) can't be tested without some rework of unittest setup, given in-memory leveldb instances are used. I can look into how difficult this would be.~~\r\n\r\nThis change adds the ability to unittest using on-disk leveldb coins dbs.\r\n\r\n#### Possible follow-ups\r\n\r\n- [ ] Unify `CDBWrapper::{m_path,m_is_memory}`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24232#discussion_r855354180",

The original PR grew larger than expected throughout the review process.\r\n\r\nThis change adds the ability to initialize a snapshot-based chainstate during init if one is detected on disk. This is of course unused as of now (aside from in unittests) given that we haven't yet enabled actually loading snapshots. \r\n\r\nDon't be scared! There are some big move-only commits in here.\r\n\r\nAccompanying changes include: \r\n\r\n- moving the snapshot coinsdb directory from being called `chainstate_[base blockhash]` to `chainstate_snapshot`, since we only support one snapshot in use at a time. This simplifies some logic, but it necessitates writing that base blockhash out to a file within the coinsdb dir. See [discussion here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24232#discussion_r832762880).\r\n- adding a simple fix in `FlushBlockFile()` that avoids a crash when attemping to flush to disk before `LoadBlockIndexDB()` is called, which happens when calling `MaybeRebalanceCaches()` during multiple chainstate init.\r\n- improving the unittest to allow testing with on-disk chainstates - necessary to test a simulated restart and re-initialization.",

      "body": "> we should probably bikeshed the protocol hard-coded value and use the lowest value we can to minimize the harm a malicious child tx can do.\r\n\r\nHere's my reasoning for the current value (4000vB), but open to feedback and I will of course add the rationale to the version3_transactions.md doc:\r\n\r\n- Upper bound: the larger we make this limit, the more vbytes we may need to replace. With default limits, if the child is e.g. 100,000vB, that might be an additional 100,000sat or more, depending on the feerate.\r\n- Lower bound: the smaller we make this limit, the fewer UTXOs we can use to fund this fee-bump. If we require all fee-bumps to only use 1 UTXO, for example, we're be requiring wallets to always maintain a pool of high-value UTXOs, one for each channel they might close.\r\n\r\nIf you're broadcasting commitment tx  `commit_a` and 4000vB is the largest output your counterparty can attach to their commitment tx `commit_b`, you can easily meet `(commit_b.fees + 4000 * minfeerate) + (incrementalfeerate * commit_a.size)` fee to replace.\r\n\r\n4000vB should give you at least 50 inputs depending on the output type, which I'm guessing is a reasonable restriction.\r\nIf you say, hey, 10 inputs is enough, then we could lower this to 1000vB.",

Most contract types can survive bleeding off a few sats once. e.g. batched payouts, coinjoins, ln-penalty\r\n\r\nScope creep to OP_TRUE becoming a standard output(up to 1 a tx?) to relay might be worth it? We can figure out the ephemeral part as a nice cleanup of current protocols further in future, and fix for eltoo-like stuff.\r\n\r\n",

          "title": "docs: remove non-signaling mentions of BIP125",
          "body": "We have pretty thorough documentation of our RBF policy in doc/policy/mempool-replacements.md. It enumerates each rule with several sentences of rationale. Also, each rule pretty much has its own function (3 and 4 share one), with extensive comments. The doc states explicitly that our rules are similar but differ from BIP125, and contains a record of historical changes to RBF policy.\r\n\r\nWe should not use \"BIP125\" as synonymous with our RBF policy because:\r\n- Our RBF policy is different from what is specified in BIP125, for example:\r\n    - the BIP does not mention our rule about the replacement feerate being higher (our Rule 6)\r\n    - the BIP uses minimum relay feerate for Rule 4, while we have used incremental relay feerate since #9380\r\n    - the \"inherited signaling\" question (CVE-2021-31876). Call it discrepancy, ambiguous wording, doc misinterpretation, or implementation details, I would recommend users refer to doc/policy/mempool-replacements.md\r\n    - the signaling policy is configurable, see #25353\r\n- Our RBF policy may change further\r\n- We have already marked BIP125 as only \"partially implemented\" in docs/bips.md since 1fd49eb498c75a1d14193bb736d195a3dc75ae12\r\n- See comments from people who are not me recently:\r\n    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038#discussion_r909507429\r\n    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25575#issuecomment-1179519204\r\n\r\nThis PR removes all non-signaling mentions of BIP125 (if people feel strongly, we can remove all mentions of BIP125 period). It may be useful to refer to the concept of \"tx opts in to RBF if it has at least one nSequence less than (0xffffffff - 1)\" as \"BIP125 signaling\" because:\r\n- It is succint.\r\n- It has already been widely marketed as BIP125 opt-in signaling.\r\n- Our API uses it when referring to signaling (e.g. getmempoolentry[\"bip125-replaceable\"] and wallet error message \"not BIP 125 replaceable\"). Changing those is more invasive.\r\n- If/when we have other ways to signal in the future, we can disambiguate them this way. See #25038 which proposes another way of signaling, and where I pulled these commits from.\r\n\r\nAlternatives:\r\n- Changing our policy to match BIP125. This doesn't make sense as, for example, we would have to remove the requirement that a replacement tx has a higher feerate (Rule 6).\r\n- Changing BIP125 to match what we have. This doesn't make sense as it would be a significant change to a BIP years after it was finalized and already used as a spec to implement RBF in other places.\r\n- Document our policy as a new BIP and give it a number. This might make sense if we don't expect things to change a lot, and can be done as a next step.\r\n",

We move away from using the funding\r\ntransaction id, as the introduction of RBF makes it such that a single\r\nchannel may have many funding transaction id's over the course of\r\nits lifetime.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to understand the gist of this PR is this video, which explains the prior protocol and overviews this one.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/i_GxmNZjwhk",

          "body": "This is part of the [assumeutxo project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/11) (parent PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606)\r\n\r\nPart two of replacing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24232.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen a user activates a snapshot, the serialized UTXO set data is used to create an \"assumed-valid\" chainstate, which becomes active in an attempt to get the node to network tip as quickly as possible. Simultaneously in the background, the already-existing chainstate continues \"conventional\" IBD to both accumulate full block data and serve as a belt-and-suspenders to validate the assumed-valid chainstate.\r\n\r\nOnce the background chainstate's tip reaches the base block of the snapshot used, we set `m_stop_use` on that chainstate and immediately take the hash of its UTXO set; we verify that this matches the assumeutxo value in the source code. Note that while we ultimately want to remove this background chainstate, we don't do so until the following initialization process, when we again check the UTXO set hash of the background chainstate, and if it continues to match, we remove the (now unnecessary) background chainstate, and move the (previously) assumed-valid chainstate into its place. We then reinitialize the chainstate in the normal way.\r\n\r\nAs noted in previous comments, we could do the filesystem operations \"inline\" immediately when the background validation completes, but that's basically just an optimization that saves disk space until the next restart. It didn't strike me as worth the risk of moving chainstate data around on disk during runtime of the node, though maybe my concerns are overblown.\r\n\r\nThe final result of this completion process is a fully-validated chain, where the only evidence that the user synced using assumeutxo is the existence of a `base_blockhash` file in the `chainstate` directory.\r\n",

This PR uses `CTxMemPool::Limits` introduced in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290 to simplify those signatures and callsites.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to improve readability and maintenance, without behaviour change.\r\n\r\nAs noted in the first commit \"refactor: mempool: change MemPoolLimits members to uint\", we currently have an underflow issue where a user could pass a negative `-limitancestorsize`, which is eventually cast to an unsigned integer. This behaviour already exists. Because it's orthogonal and to minimize scope, I think this should be fixed in a separate PR.",

If so, what are they?\r\n\r\n * Is it reasonable to enforce BIP 125's rbf rules on all transactions, if those rules themselves are not always incentive compatible?\r\n\r\n * If someone were to propose a command line option that breaks v3 transaction relay in the future, is there a logical basis for opposing that which is consistent with moving towards fullrbf now?\r\n",

          "body": "Two birds with one stone: replacement of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26278 with simplification of the MiniWallet's transaction creation logic.\r\n\r\nCurrently the MiniWallet creates simple txns (1 input, 1 output) with `create_self_transfer`.  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24637 introduced `create_self_transfer_multi` **which uses** `create_self_transfer` to create a \"transaction template\" which then adjusts (copy and mutate inputs and outputs) in order to create more complex multi-input multi-output transactions. \r\nThis can more easily lead to issues such as https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26278 and is more of a maintenance burden.\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies the logic by going the other way around. Now `create_self_transfer` **uses** `create_self_transfer_multi`.\r\nThe transaction creation logic has been moved to `create_self_transfer_multi` which is being called by `create_self_transfer` to construct the simple case of 1 input 1 output transaction.",

          "body": "Upon reviewing the documentation for `CTxMemPool::CalculateMemPoolAncestors`, I noticed `setAncestors` was meant to be an `out` parameter but actually is an `in,out` parameter, as can be observed by adding `assert(setAncestors.empty());` as the first line in the function and running `make check`. This PR fixes this unexpected behaviour and introduces refactoring improvements to make intents and effects of the code more clear.\r\n\r\n## Unexpected behaviour\r\nThis behaviour occurs only in the package acceptance path, currently only triggered by `testmempoolaccept` and `submitpackage` RPCs. \r\n\r\nIn `MemPoolAccept::AcceptMultipleTransactions()`, we first call `PreChecks()` and then `SubmitPackage()` with the same `Workspace ws` reference. `PreChecks` leaves `ws.m_ancestors` in a potentially non-empty state, before it is passed on to `MemPoolAccept::SubmitPackage`. `SubmitPackage` is the only place where `setAncestors` isn't guaranteed to be empty before calling `CalculateMemPoolAncestors`. The most straightforward fix is to just forcefully clear `setAncestors` at the beginning of CalculateMemPoolAncestors, which is done in the first bugfix commit.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n### Return value instead of out-parameters\r\nThis PR updates the function signatures for `CTxMemPool::CalculateMemPoolAncestors` and `CTxMemPool::CalculateAncestorsAndCheckLimits` to use a `util::Result` return type and eliminate both the `setAncestors` `in,out`-parameter as well as the error string. It simplifies the code and makes the intent and effects more explicit.\r\n\r\n### Observability\r\nThere are 7 instances where we currently call `CalculateMemPoolAncestors` without actually checking if the function succeeded because we assume that it can't fail, such as in [miner.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/69b10212ea5370606c7a5aa500a70c36b4cbb58f/src/node/miner.cpp#L399). This PR adds a new wrapper `AssumeCalculateMemPoolAncestors` function that logs such unexpected failures, or in case of debug builds even halts the program. It's not crucial to the objective, more of an observability improvement that seems sensible to add on here.",

I can also alleviate any concerns with current zero-conf acceptance risk mitigation.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate being heard, and having a fair chance to be reviewed and considered.\r\n\r\nI also need time for consideration because I am assisting some merchants and users with understanding how to interface with Bitcoin Core and what is happening, so they can express their support for this PR, and their value of zero-conf being useful as a service. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I am advocating for the Bitcoin network state that has thrived for its entire history so far, and asking that Bitcoin Core avoid steering policy.",

      "body": "This is mentioned in a few other places, but Rule 3 pinning via additional ancestor is still not resolved with the multi-parent-1-child case. Quick diagram to illustrate - this was pointed out to me by @instagibbs.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25183001/202760386-96466fd8-659b-40fe-a943-529fcdd8dd84.png)\r\n\r\nWorking on further restricting the rules to 1-parent-1-child since that eliminates the possibility of a conflict's high fees diluted by ancestors. Will add more tests as well, and then will take out of draft when finished.\r\n\r\n> if we're doing nVersion 3, we should also fix the lack of discouragement for uninterpreted nSequence values and arguments to CSV/CLTV. see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22871\r\n\r\nWill consider adding this if people feel strongly. Wondering if others on this thread have thoughts on it?",

Usage is demonstrated in the example script `contrib/tracing/mempool_monitor.py`. Interface tests are provided in `test/functional/interface_usdt_mempool.py`.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for passing the removal reason as a string instead of numerically is that the benefits of not having to maintain a redundant enum-string mapping seem to outweigh the small cost of string generation. The reject reason is passed as string as well, although in this instance the string does not have to be generated but is readily available.",

Especially if we have to face worst-case scenario in case of coordinated response between both Bitcoin Core and Lightning implementations, e.g non-propagating justice transactions due to some pinning/standardness malleability vector. Advanced mempool policy to improve contracting protocols security like Lightning (e.g https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038), while they improve the state of things, they also increase the critical dependency surface on our side. Further, we could even have to modify in-flight channel types in agreement with our counterparty, and in the lack of https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1026, having enough time to figure out a workaround sounds conservative practice.\r\n\r\nIf we see CSV delays being penalized in the selection of channel counterparties in the future, we can decrease this value again, or at least when we think the ecosystem robustness is more mature. \r\n\r\n(Note, this is acknowledged tests are not fixed yet, seeking Concept ACK first)",

          "body": "This PR fixes a bug and improves the mempool accept interface to return information more predictably.\r\n\r\nBug: In package validation, we first try the transactions individually (see doc/policy/packages.md for more explanation) and, if they all failed for missing inputs and policy-related (i.e. fee) reasons, we'll try package validation. Otherwise, we'll just \"quit early\" since, for example, if a transaction had an invalid signature, adding a child will not help make it valid. Currently, when we quit early, we're not setting the `package_state` to be invalid, so the caller might think it succeeded. Also, we're returning no results - it makes more sense to return the individual transaction failure. Thanks instagibbs for catching https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038#discussion_r1013293248!\r\n\r\nAlso, make the package results interface generally more useful/predictable:\r\n- Always return the feerate at which a transaction was considered for `CheckFeeRate` in `MempoolAcceptResult::m_effective_feerate` when it was successful. This can replace the current `PackageMempoolAcceptResult::m_package_feerate`, which only sometimes exists.\r\n- Always provide an entry for every transaction in `PackageMempoolAcceptResult::m_tx_results` when the error is `PCKG_TX`.",

          "body": "This contains everything to make mempool/validation logic ready for package relay (see #27463).\r\n\r\nDesign goals:\r\n- Be able to gracefully deal with any arbitrary list of transactions (these come from p2p)\r\n- Validate any ancestor package so that the incentive-compatible transactions end up in our mempool.\r\n  - If the transactions would be accepted individually, they should also be accepted through `AcceptPackage`. We don't want to accidentally reject things just because we happened to download them as a package.\r\n  - Bug prior to these changes: we required `IsChildWithParents` but if there were dependencies between the parents, we could end up (1) accepting a low-feerate child or (2) rejecting a high-feerate parent CPFPing another parent. See the \"interdependent parents\" test case for a specific example.\r\n- Be DoS-resistant.\r\n   - Avoid quadratic validation costs.\r\n   - Avoid loading a lot of stuff from disk, or loading repeatedly.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 main improvements to package evaluation here:\r\n(1) We submit transactions with their in-package ancestor sets.\r\n\t-  See unit test `package_ppfp`: without this change, we would reject everything.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_ppfc`: shows that this doesn't let us do \"parent pays for child;\" we only do this when the individual and ancestor feerates meet mempool minimum feerate\r\n(2) We linearize the package transactions based on ancestor set scoring.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_needs_reorder`: without this change, if we use the original order of transactions, we would only accept 1 grandparent, even if we submit subpackages.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_desc_limits`: without this change, we accept one of the lower-feerate transactions (a bit more of a \"nice to have\" than a \"must have\" example).\r\n\r\nA description of the package validation logic (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26711#issuecomment-1647523520):\r\n\r\n- Basic sanitization. Quit if it's too big, inconsistent, etc.\r\n- Linearize (Topological sort only)\r\n- **PreChecks loop** For each tx, grab UTXOs to calculate fees and filter out anything we should skip:\r\n    - If already in mempool (or same txid in mempool), mark as skip\r\n    - If missing inputs or conflict, record this failure and mark this and all descendants as skip.\r\n    - If no failures or TX_SINGLE_FAILURE, continue\r\n    - For some failures that we expect due to differing chainstates, skip these transactions and their descendants, but continue.\r\n    - Otherwise, record this failure and mark that we will `quit_early` (i.e. not do the Subpackage validation loop).\r\n- Refine our linearization using the fee information.\r\n- **Subpackage validation loop** For each transaction in the new linearized order:\r\n    - Get the transaction's ancestor subpackage.\r\n    - If the feerate of this transaction is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - If the feerate of this subpackage is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - Otherwise, try to submit the subpackage, using `AcceptSingleTransaction()` if it's just 1 tx\r\n    - if at any point we get a non-fee-related error, abort all.\r\n- Call `LimitMempoolSize`\r\n- Backfill results:\r\n    - If the transaction was in mempool, check to see if it's still there in case it was trimmed in `LimitMempoolSize`.\r\n    - Try to use results from the subpackage validation loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early), use results from prechecks loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early and we hadn't found a failure with it yet), fill with `TX_UNKNOWN`.\r\n\r\nThis means we will call `PreChecks` for each transaction 2 times (fewer if we quit early), and run all other validation checks at most 1 time. A transaction shouldn't be validated in the subpackage validation loop more than once.",

          "body": "Part of package relay, see #27463.\r\n\r\nNote that this still allows packages to bump transactions that are below the dynamic mempool minimum feerate, which means this still solves the \"mempool is congested and my presigned 1sat/vB tx is screwed\" problem for all transactions.\r\n\r\nOn master, the package policy (only accessible through regtest-only RPC submitpackage) allows 0-fee (or otherwise below min relay feerate) transactions if they are bumped by a child. However, with default package limits, we don't yet have a DoS-resistant way of ensuring these transactions remain bumped throughout their time in the mempool. Primarily, the fee-bumping child may later be replaced by another transaction that doesn't bump the parent(s). The parent(s) could potentially stay bumped by other transactions, but not enough to ever be selected by the `BlockAssembler` (due to `blockmintxfee`).\r\n\r\nFor example, (tested [here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/commits/26933-motivation)):\r\n- The mempool accepts 24 below-minrelayfeerate transactions (\"0-fee parents\"), all bumped by a single high-fee transaction (\"the fee-bumping child\"). The fee-bumping child also spends a confirmed UTXO.\r\n- Two additional children are added to each 0-fee parent. These children each pay a feerate slightly above the minimum relay feerate (e.g. 1.9sat/vB) such that, for each 0-fee parent, the total fees of its two children divided by the total size of the children and parent is above the minimum relay feerate.\r\n- If a block template is built now, all transactions would be selected.\r\n- A transaction replaces the the fee-bumping child, spending only the confirmed UTXO and not any of the outputs from the 0-fee parents.\r\n - The 0-fee parents now each have 2 children. Their descendant feerates are above minrelayfeerate, which means that they remain in the mempool, even if the mempool evicts all below-minrelayfeerate packages.\r\n - If a block template is built now, none of the 0-fee parents or their children would be selected.\r\n - Even more low-feerate descendants can be added to these below-minrelayfeerate packages and they will not be evicted until they expire or the mempool reaches capacity.\r\n\r\nUnless we have a DoS-resistant way of ensuring package CPFP-bumped transactions are always bumped, allowing package CPFP to bump below-minrelayfeerate transactions can result in these problematic situations. See #27018 which proposes a partial solution with some limitations, and contains discussion about potential improvements to eviction strategy. While no adequate solution exists, for now, avoid these situations by requiring all transactions to meet min relay feerate.",

      "body": "Lightning legacy channel types (before BOLT9's `option_anchors_output` / `option_anchors_zero_fee_htlc_tx`) presents the issue of counterparty's second-stage HTLC transactons malleable enough to opt-out from BIP125 replacement rules (the preimage path on the local commitment transaction offered output and the timeout path on the local commitment transaction accepted output). This path can be leveraged by a counterarty not only to do opt-out pinning but also for rule #3 style of pinning, where the second-stage HTLC transaction is malleated to a high-fee/low-feerate.\r\n\r\nThis repleaceability issue is moving away with `option_anchors_zero_fee_htlc_tx`, where all the second-stage spends must\r\nsignal replacement due to the new CSV 1 to satisfy. This anchor states are currently signed under nversion=2, assuming\r\nwe have [dynamic upgrades](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-July/002763.html), a new channel type with states committing to nversion=3 could be deployed in-flight (i.e without confirming on-chain new funding outputs). Those channels would be safe against rule #3 style of pinning, as if old RBF opt-in nversion=2 states are used for pinning, under the proposed policy rules (\"All directly conflicting transactions signal replaceability explicitly, either through  BIP125 or V3.\", the incentive-compatible enhanced RBF rules should apply.\r\n\r\nAs of today, `option_anchors_zero_fee_htlc_tx` is enabled by default by Eclair (since [v0.7.0](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/blob/master/docs/release-notes/eclair-v0.7.0.md)) and LND (since [v.0.12.0](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.12.0-beta)). This is not deployed by default by CLN and LDK. So we would still have probably tens of thousands of legacy channels forever exposed to pinning attacks mitigated by nversion=3. For this subset, this is a wonder if we would like to introduce some \"retro-active\" policy effect, where nversion=3 effects are granted to the legacy channel types with some at-broadcast opt-in mechanism. E.g a signature from a pubkey of the funding output committing to a package version bit. Of course, this would be more technical complexity on the Core-side, at the security and economic benefit of Lightning channels, so trade-off.\r\n\r\nLightning node operators of legacy channel types could be also just force-close all channels, and re-open new safer ones.\r\nAssuming it's done in an asynchronous fashion (to avoid accidental flood&loot situations) and mempool fees, this should\r\nbe okay. On the other hand, I can see the operators incentives to keep unsafe channel open to preserve good reputation\r\naccumulated in routing algorithms.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think the deployment cost are low enough on the Lightning-side to not bother with dedicated \"retro-active\"\r\npolicy mechanism on the Core-side, at least in this case. Though this is only my own appreciation of the deployment cost\r\nand it's highly probable we'll have newer policy to deploy in the future and interactions with channel types, so I think\r\nit can valuable to think about it.",

We need to know what to do with these transactions if they lose their sponsor, e.g. due to a replacement that removed the input spending this 0-fee transaction.\r\n\r\nThis is made slightly more complicated by the fact that our \"selection scoring\" (BlockAssembler) is different from our \"eviction scoring.\" Roughly, we select based on ancestor feerate and evict based on descendant feerate. This may lead to [evicting things we would actually want to mine](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27018#issuecomment-1424742766) and [not evicting things that we will never mine](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933#issuecomment-1400143991).\r\n\r\nThis PR's approach is to remove the 1sat/vB `-blockmintxfee` and have BlockAssembler select anything in the mempool (still based on ancestor packages, but not stopping at 1sat/vB). It also adds logic to `TrimToSize()` to evict anything paying <=0 fees. The idea is, if we're getting to the bottom of our mempool, we scrape up all the sats we can. Anything that pays *some* fee is worth adding to the block template.\r\n\r\nA major advantage of this approach is that 0-fee, non-v3 transactions can be bumped in package CPFP.\r\n\r\nA few observations which may or may not be problematic:\r\n- This increases the potential work after a reorg, since we add an extra step of removing the below-minrelayfeerate entries.\r\n- This increases the number of transactions that may be evicted in a replacement (from the worst case scenario we discussed before, it's up to 2500 entries).\r\n- This means you can remove a transaction from your own mempool by calling prioritisetransaction with a negative value.\r\n",

Even without package relay, we can run into this problem if we are shrinking -maxmempool or raising -minrelaytxfee on a restart.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nWhen loading mempool.dat, use `bypass_limits=true` and then call `TrimToSize()` at the very end.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n- We definitely keep the \"highest descendant score\" transactions if mempool min feerate rises.\r\n- It's extremely simple implementation-wise.\r\n- It's simple to keep track of what made it in and what didn't.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages:\r\n- If mempool.dat is very large, we can exceed maxmempool by quite a bit.\r\n- This won't be sufficient for ephemeral anchors (unless `bypass_limits` allows not-yet-spent anchors).\r\n",

          "title": "contrib: add tool to convert compact-serialized UTXO set to SQLite database",
          "body": "## Problem description\r\n\r\nThere is demand from users to get the UTXO set in form of a SQLite database (#24628). Bitcoin Core currently only supports dumping the UTXO set in a binary _compact-serialized_ format, which was crafted specifically for AssumeUTXO snapshots (see PR #16899), with the primary goal of being as compact as possible. Previous PRs tried to extend the `dumptxoutset` RPC with new formats, either in human-readable form (e.g. #18689, #24202), or most recently, directly as SQLite database (#24952). Both are not optimal: due to the huge size of the ever-growing UTXO set with already more than 80 million entries on mainnet, human-readable formats are practically useless, and very likely one of the first steps would be to put them in some form of database anyway. Directly adding SQLite3 dumping support on the other hand introduces an additional dependency to the non-wallet part of bitcoind and the risk of increased maintenance burden (see e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1163551060, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24628#issuecomment-1108469715).\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis PR follows the \"external tooling\" route by adding a simple Python script for achieving the same goal in a two-step process (first create compact-serialized UTXO set via `dumptxoutset`, then convert it to SQLite via the new script). Executive summary:\r\n- single file, no extra dependencies (sqlite3 is included in Python's standard library [1])\r\n- ~150 LOC, mostly deserialization/decompression routines ported from the Core codebase and (probably the most difficult part) a little elliptic curve / finite field math to decompress pubkeys (essentialy solving the secp256k1 curve equation y^2 = x^3 + 7 for y given x, respecting the proper polarity as indicated by the compression tag)\r\n- creates a database with only one table `utxos` with the following schema:\r\n  ```(txid TEXT, vout INT, value INT, coinbase INT, height INT, scriptpubkey TEXT)```\r\n- the resulting file has roughly 2x the size of the compact-serialized UTXO set (this is mostly due to encoding txids and scriptpubkeys as hex-strings rather than bytes)\r\n\r\n[1] note that there are some rare cases of operating systems like FreeBSD though, where the sqlite3 module has to installed explicitly (see #26819)\r\n\r\nA functional test is also added that creates UTXO set entries with various output script types (standard and also non-standard, for e.g. large scripts) and verifies that the UTXO sets of both formats match by comparing corresponding MuHashes. One MuHash is supplied by the bitcoind instance via `gettxoutsetinfo muhash`, the other is calculated in the test by reading back the created SQLite database entries and hashing them with the test framework's `MuHash3072` module.\r\n\r\n## Manual test instructions\r\nI'd suggest to do manual tests also by comparing MuHashes. For that, I've written a go tool some time ago which would calculate the MuHash of a sqlite database in the created format (I've tried to do a similar tool in Python, but it's painfully slow).\r\n```\r\n$ [run bitcoind instance with -coinstatsindex]\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli dumptxoutset ~/utxos.dat\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo muhash <block height returned in previous call>\r\n(outputs MuHash calculated from node)\r\n\r\n$ ./contrib/utxo-tools/utxo_to_sqlite.py ~/utxos.dat ~/utxos.sqlite\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/theStack/utxo_dump_tools\r\n$ cd utxo_dump_tools/calc_utxo_hash\r\n$ go run calc_utxo_hash.go ~/utxos.sqlite\r\n(outputs MuHash calculated from the SQLite UTXO set)\r\n\r\n=> verify that both MuHashes are equal\r\n```\r\nFor a demonstration what can be done with the resulting database, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#pullrequestreview-956290477 for some example queries. Thanks go to LarryRuane who gave me to the idea of rewriting this script in Python and adding it to `contrib`.",

It is also a follow up to #26177.\r\n\r\nIt replaces pull request https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27294, which just moved the constants to a new file, but did not re-declare them as enums.\r\n\r\nThe code move of the chain name constants out of the `chainparamsbase` to their own separate header allows the kernel `chainparams` to no longer include `chainparamsbase`. The `chainparamsbase` contain references to the `ArgsManager` and networking related options that should not belong to the kernel library. Besides this move, the constants are re-declared as enums with helper functions facilitating string conversions.",

I strongly suggest that reviewers look at that PR first to decide if they are comfortable with the overall approach.\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly refactors, with a few behavior changes and improvements:\r\n- Introduces `TxDownloadManager`, which handles all transaction downloading. It contains the `TxRequestTracker`, `TxOrphanage`, and filters for `AlreadyHaveTx`.\r\n- Updates logs for tx {validation, relay, orphans} to include both txid and wtxid when possible.\r\n- Adds a new log category, `TXPACKAGES`. Logging in the orphanage is changed from `MEMPOOL` to `TXPACKAGES`.\r\n- Adds support for tracking when multiple peers provided the same tx in the orphanage.\r\n- Makes `TxDownloadManager` responsible for tracking the orphans we need to resolve and deciding how/when to resolve them.\r\n- Adds all announcers of an orphan as potential resolution candidates. This tracker is a `TxDownloadManager` which helps us schedule requests.\r\n   - In this PR, \"orphan resolution\" means requesting missing parents by `getdata(MSG_TX | MSG_WITNESS_FLAG, missing_txid)`.\r\n    - In a future PR, we'll add another resolution method, requesting ancestor wtxids using `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO, orphan_wtxid)`.",

          "body": "While we are evaluating a package, we split it into \"subpackages\" for evaluation (currently subpackages all have size 1 except the last one). If a subpackage has size 1, we may add a tx to mempool and call `LimitMempoolSize()`, which evicts transactions if the mempool gets full. We handle the case where the just-submitted transaction is evicted immediately, but we don't handle the case in which a transaction from a previous subpackage (either just submitted or already in mempool) is evicted. Mainly, since the coins created by the evicted transaction are cached in `m_view`, we don't realize the UTXO has disappeared until `CheckInputsFromMempoolAndCache` asserts that they exist. Also, the returned `PackageMempoolAcceptResult` reports that the transaction is in mempool even though it isn't anymore.\r\n\r\nFix this by not calling `LimitMempoolSize()` until the very end, and editing the results map with \"mempool full\" if things fall out.\r\n\r\nPointed out by instagibbs in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/faeed687e5cde5e32750d93818dd1d4add837f24 on top of the v3 PR.",

The mempool headers include the boost multi index headers. Thus any application wanting to use the kernel library and its headers will have to include the boost headers too. This is not only undesirable because of the sheer size of these headers, but also might lead to conflicts if the including application uses a different boost version.\r\n\r\nIn the approach laid out by this PR, mempool member variables and methods are declared in the header without having to include boost by either wrapping them in a struct and [pimpling](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl) them, or making methods static implementation functions. The boost definitions are gathered into separate header (`mempool_set_definitions.h`) that is only included by implementation files that require definitions of the boost types. This allows us to retain the current architecture with roughly the same interfaces. \r\n\r\nThe approach laid out by this PR also has some, albeit small, compilation speed and size benefits. Averaged over a few of compilation runs I consistently observe faster compilation by a couple of seconds and some smaller pre-processed and compiled object sizes. The main detractor of this method is obviously the number of lines touched. However it also has the benefit of inventorizing all the files that require direct access to the mempool data structures as well getting rid of boost multi index includes in non-kernel implementation files that include the mempool, but don't directly manipulate its data structures (e.g. wallet.cpp).\r\n\r\nA much simpler alternative approach, at least on the surface, would be removing all `txmempool.h` includes from kernel library headers (see [this branch](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/mempoolBoostSimple)). Currently this is only `validation.h`.  Due to the mutex member of `CTxMemPool` and the correspondingly defined lock decorators on the chainstate methods this becomes a bit more complicated though and I am not sure how this might be possible with the current architecture.\r\n\r\nA discussion of how and if to remove the mempool from the kernel library has so far been intentionally punted to the next stage of the kernel library development. Pimpling the mempool itself precludes this discussion, since the library could never be shipped with the `CTxMemPool` headers. Pimpling the mempool members (like done in this PR) might also make a future splitting of block and mempool validation logic into separate compilation units easier.",

          "body": "This is an attempt to  #11775 \r\n\r\nThis Pr will enable fee estimator to listen to ValidationInterface notifications to process new transactions added and removed from the mempool.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Added a new callback to the Validation Interface `MempoolTransactionsRemovedForConnectedBlock`, which notifies listeners about the transactions that have been removed due to a new block being connected, along with the height at which the transactions were removed.\r\n- Modified the `TransactionAddedToMempool` callback parameter to include additional information about the transaction needed for fee estimation.\r\n- Updated `CBlockPolicyEstimator` to process transactions using` CTransactionRef` instead of `CTxMempoolEntry.`\r\n- Implemented the `CValidationInterface` interface in `CBlockPolicyEstimater` and overridden the `TransactionAddedToMempool`, `TransactionRemovedFromMempool`, and `MempoolTransactionsRemovedForConnectedBlock` methods to receive updates from their notifications.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the fee estimator updates from the mempool, i.e whenever a new block is connected all transactions in the block that are in our mempool are going to be removed using the `removeForBlock` function in `txmempool.cpp`. \r\n\r\nThis removal triggered updates to the fee estimator. As a result, the fee estimator would block mempool's `cs` until it finished updating every time a new block was connected.\r\nInstead of being blocked only on mempool tx removal, we were blocking on both tx removal and fee estimator updating.\r\nIf we want to further improve fee estimation, or add heavy-calulation steps to it, it is currently not viable as we would be slowing down block relay in the process\r\n\r\nThis PR is smaller in terms of the changes made compared to #11775, as it focuses solely on enabling fee estimator updates from the validationInterface/cscheduler thread notifications.\r\n\r\nI have not split the validation interface because, as I understand it, the rationale behind the split in #11775 was to have `MempoolInterface` signals come from the mempool and `CValidationInterface` events come from validation. I believe this separation can be achieved in a separate refactoring PR when the need arises.\r\n\r\nAlso left out some commits from #11775\r\n- Some refactoring which are no longer needed.\r\n- Handle reorgs much better in fee estimator. \r\n- Track witness hash malleation in fee estimator \r\n\r\nI believe they are a separate change that can come in a follow-up after this.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Looked on the proposed `doc/policy/version3_transactions.md` changes with other Lightning eyes on a whiteboard, and as far as I can tell it works well for Lightning usual flow and also upcoming dual-funding / splicing: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/863 (to be checked again when the specs are finalized)\r\n\r\nThe replacement rule for signed version=3 transactions is the following as of 06e41874, it can replaces nversion=2 signaling replaceability or opt-out transactions in a node with `mempoolfullrbf=1`. It cannot replace non-signaling nversion=2 (L785 in `src/validation.cpp`). In term of types of Lightning channels:\r\n- old legacy channels: second-stage HTLC txn on counterparty commitment can be still be pinned (cf. mailing list post https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-April/002639.html)\r\n- anchor-outputs channels: commitment and second-stage HTLC are explicitly signaling RBF on both asymmetric states\r\n\r\nOnce nversion=3 is deployed, the new nversion=3 should be able to to replace all the anchor-outputs channels transactions without rejection. I think old legacy channels Lightning node operators would be advised to upgrade to anchor-outputs channels as soon as it’s ready in their Lightning implementations, and they’ve practical understanding of fee-bumping reserves management and swallow the bullet in term of on-chain fees. In the current state of things, I don’t think there is a need to introduce unilateral retroactive policy rules effect as suggested [above](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038#issuecomment-1405944407), though this can be a welcome mechanism in the far future to massively save on on-chain fees for the Lightning ecosystem.\r\n\r\nI think missing test coverage for v3 transactions not replacing not-bip125-signaling v2 transaction\r\n\r\n```\r\ncommit aec6ea3a378d532cd86f8812006e4eb42e185662\r\nAuthor: Antoine Riard <dev@ariard.me>\r\nDate:   Thu Sep 7 04:27:49 2023 +0100\r\n\r\n    Add non-v3 trasnsactions not signaling not replaceable test\r\n\r\ndiff --git a/test/functional/mempool_package_rbf.py b/test/functional/mempool_package_rbf.py\r\nindex e969b0249b..dd1c55be05 100755\r\n--- a/test/functional/mempool_package_rbf.py\r\n+++ b/test/functional/mempool_package_rbf.py\r\n@@ -143,6 +143,24 @@ class PackageRBFTest(BitcoinTestFramework):\r\n         self.assert_mempool_contents(expected=package_txns_v3, unexpected=[tx_bip125_v2[\"tx\"]])\r\n         self.generate(node, 1)\r\n \r\n+        self.log.info(\"Test that non-V3 transactions not signaling BIP125 are not replaceable\")\r\n+        coin = self.coins.pop()\r\n+\r\n+        tx_nobip125_v2 = self.wallet.create_self_transfer(\r\n+            fee=DEFAULT_FEE,\r\n+            utxo_to_spend=coin,\r\n+            sequence=MAX_BIP125_RBF_SEQUENCE +1,\r\n+            version=2\r\n+        )\r\n+        node.sendrawtransaction(tx_nobip125_v2[\"hex\"])\r\n+\r\n+        self.assert_mempool_contents(expected=[tx_nobip125_v2[\"tx\"]])\r\n+        assert not node.getmempoolentry(tx_nobip125_v2[\"tx\"].rehash())[\"bip125-replaceable\"]\r\n+        assert tx_bip125_v2[\"tx\"].nVersion == 2\r\n+        package_hex_v3, package_txns_v3 = self.create_simple_package(coin, parent_fee=0, child_fee=DEFAULT_FEE * 3, version=3)\r\n+        assert all([tx.nVersion == 3 for tx in package_txns_v3])\r\n+        assert_raises_rpc_error(-26, \"txn-mempool-conflict\", node.submitpackage, package_hex_v3)\r\n+\r\n     def test_package_rbf_additional_fees(self):\r\n         self.log.info(\"Check Package RBF must increase the absolute fee\")\r\n         node = self.nodes[0]\r\n```",

Suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933#issuecomment-1510851570\r\n\r\nThis RPC should be safe but still experimental - interface may change, not all features (e.g. package RBF) are implemented, etc. If a miner wants to expose this to people, they can effectively use \"package relay\" before the p2p changes are implemented. However, please note **this is not package relay**; transactions submitted this way will not relay to other nodes if the feerates are below their mempool min fee. Users should put this behind some kind of rate limit or permissions.",

That's why we have the \"Warning: Batched fee-bumping may be unsafe for some use cases.

Total package fees = 2600 sat.\r\n\r\nUnder the rules described here, package (A', B') could replace (A, B) in the mempool, because total fees are paid for and there's enough left over fee to pay the incremental relay fee of the new package (1500 sat/1100 vb). Also the package feerate is higher than that of the direct conflicts[1].\r\n\r\nThe deficiency in the logic is that we're not looking at the feerates of the transactions that would be evicted -- even though their absolute fee is being paid, their feerate could be even higher than the transactions that would replace them.  Calculating the effective feerate that such a transaction would have in our mining code is tricky (because a sibling could pay for an ancestor, it's not quite right to just consider ancestor feerate), but using its feerate is a conservative check here -- any descendant that is paying for its confirmation would be caught in this logic, and its (higher) feerate considered if necessary.\r\n\r\nFor evaluating the mining suitability of the new transactions coming in, I think we can just look at the ancestor feerate of the package, which is a lower bound on the attractiveness of the new transactions.  (I think this would also allow us to relax the rule against new unconfirmed inputs.)\r\n\r\n[1] In looking at this example, I noticed that BIP 125 as drafted seems to misstate an important check we perform in our current RBF policy, namely that we compare the feerate of a new transaction coming in to the feerate of the existing transactions that it directly conflicts with.  (Without this check, a small high fee transaction could be replaced by a large low fee transaction!). From my first glance at the code in this PR, it looks like the code itself does a similar check for packages (comparing the package feerate to the feerate of the direct conflicts) so that is good at least, but the description of the logic in the documentation should point out that there is some feerate check happening as well.\r\n\r\n",

We'd still be missing the case where something being evicted has a lower ancestor score than its actual mining score because of an unrelated transaction that is paying for a low feerate parent, but maybe that is an edge case that we can overlook (especially since the total fees in the mempool are still going up and the first order approximation of mining desirability is also going up).  \r\n\r\nI was trying to think about whether this approach might be attackable in some way to either muck with fee estimation or attack someone's mempool with low quality transactions, but I need to give it more thought.\r\n\r\nAn alternate approach to this problem might be to define some new (opt in) relay policy that limits the scope of descendant transactions in some way, and then only implement a package RBF policy that would interact with transactions that meet that limited criteria.

You would like to replace C with newer transaction C' (100vb, 10 sat/vb) spending parent A and parent D (1000vb, 20 sat/vb). While the ancestor score of C' is better than C, the feerate is far less compelling and it should be rejected by the mempool. However, the low-ancestor score child C should not be mined for a while and the pin succeeds, if this scenario is correct.\r\n\r\n> An alternate approach to this problem might be to define some new (opt in) relay policy that limits the scope of descendant transactions in some way, and then only implement a package RBF policy that would interact with transactions that meet that limited criteria.\r\n\r\nI don't know if any opt-in approach limiting the size of the package (both ancestors/descendants) is compatible with miners incentives. I think a pinning attacker would be always able to attach an ancestor beyond the limit downgrading the high-feerate replacement candidate ancestor score.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we have considered other scoring approach like best-ancestor-score of the latest generation of package transactions. I.e, if you have parent A, parent B and child C and grandchild D, and you would like to replace with new package parent A, parent E and child C' you evaluate ancestor score of C' against grandchild D. I think it could be a correct answer to the miner viewpoint \"Which competing chain of transactions is the most interesting to include ?\". Though I don't know if it's fully incentive compatible.",

They also broadcast an unrelated high-fee tx B (50sat/vB), and a child C which spends from A and B. Since C spends from B, it has a high ancestor feerate (even though they wouldn't be mined together), and is thus harder to replace. But since B is high feerate, it will be mined soon, so we're probably fine.\r\n\r\n> An alternate approach to this problem might be to define some new (opt in) relay policy that limits the scope of descendant transactions in some way, and then only implement a package RBF policy that would interact with transactions that meet that limited criteria. That might be a good direction to go if our broader attempts at this problem result in behavior that's not incentive compatible..?\r\n\r\nI'm now pretty convinced that opt-in shrinking ancestor/descendant limits is the way to go (ping @instagibbs who had ideas about this being necessary in the future). Maybe we start allowing nVersion=3 (or whatever signal we decide) and it doubles as a signal for package RBF and stricter limits (and BIP 125 signaling would not be used for package RBF).\r\n\r\nA few questions:\r\n\r\n- Is it possible to have single transaction limits as well (e.g. a single transaction cannot be more than 10KvB)? If so, that seems simpler than restricting descendants based on the size of the original transaction. Or would that be a bad idea, since it would also imply fewer possible in-flight HTLCs?\r\n- In this policy, I think we would want to require \"any tx spending from an unconfirmed nVersion=3 tx must also be nVersion=3?\" And if a nVersion=3 transaction has ancestors that aren't nVersion=3, we'd use the stricter limits? Following that, I guess we would also need \"any tx replacing an nVersion=3 tx must also be nVersion=3?\"\r\n- Assuming we can figure out something sensible, it seems better to have both ancestor and descendant limits? Adding descendant limits resolves the \"you must pay for all conflicts\" type of pinning. But adding an ancestor limit could be beneficial in resolving the \"create a replacement tx with a giant ancestor\" type pinning.",

      "body": "> Assuming we can figure out something sensible, it seems better to have both ancestor and descendant limits? Adding descendant limits resolves the \"you must pay for all conflicts\" type of pinning. But adding an ancestor limit could be beneficial in resolving the \"create a replacement tx with a giant ancestor\" type pinning.\r\n\r\nYeah I was thinking in this direction as well.  I wonder if we could find some super minimal use case, like a 2-transaction package replacing another 2-transaction package, and just implement that to start.  I think the rough idea would be:\r\n- some opt-in flag (eg nVersion=3, or anything else) indicates that a transaction can't have more than 1 in-mempool descendant with no more than X vbytes of total size.  Any descendant is also not allowed to have more than 1 ancestor.\r\n- When a 1-child, 1-parent package comes in, if it conflicts with at most 1 opt-in package, allow for RBF semantics along the lines of what we're discussing. In this case, I think we would require the package feerate to be greater than the ancestor feerates of both transactions that would be replaced (along with the total fee check, and the incremental relay fee check).\r\n\r\nWould there be value to any layer 2 projects if something this minimal were to be implemented?

The fact that in my sketches I can *get rid of carveout*, and naively support N-party contracts speaks to me that we're on the right path. The fact it makes simple systems like batched payouts potentially more robust is also a win.\r\n\r\n1) I am 99% sure we want to limit *entire* package limits to make rule#3 pinning not a kill shot for replacement replacement\r\n\r\n2) @t-bast  Ephemeral dust, or dust values that are immediately spent within the package, enable LN and other systems to switch over to a single anchor output, obviating the requirement for carveout rules, and would fit within the one-parent-one-child pattern.\r\n\r\nWe could expand this to two direct children limit, and preserve the carveout to make sure currently deployed systems get benefits, assuming it's not otherwise a DoS/incentive compatible issue\r\n\r\n3) Another nice-to-have would be forced signaling of replacability of the child tx, since the single-anchor spend is mostly freeform.

The package is child-with-parents.\n+\n+*Rationale*: The fee-related rules are economically rational for ancestor packages, but not\n+necessarily other types of packages.\n+\n+However, allowing replacement for all ancestor packages also might not make sense due to the\n+increased complexity.\n+\n+2. At least one of the following signaling conditions is met:\n+\n+    1a. All of the directly conflicting transactions signal BIP125 replaceability explicitly.\n+\n+        *Rationale*: Any transaction that is replaceable without package RBF should still be\n+        replaceable.\n+\n+    1b. All directly conflicting transactions have `nVersion=3` and each package transaction that\n+        conflicts with a mempool transaction also has `nVersion=3`.\n+\n+        *Rationale*: This helps preserve the mempool policy that any transaction spending an\n+        unconfirmed `nVersion=3` transaction must also have `nVersion=3`. Otherwise, the child of a\n+        `nVersion=3` transaction could be replaced by a non-`nVersion=3` transaction, and thus there\n+        would be an `nVersion=3` transaction in the mempool with a non-`nVersion=3` child.\n+\n+        *Rationale*: Since V3 is inherited, this form of RBF signaling is implicitly inherited. That is,\n+        while a V3 transaction is unconfirmed, any descendant(s) accepted to the mempool must also be\n+        V3 and are thus also replaceable.\n+\n+3. The child transaction does not conflict with any transactions in the mempool.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Reduce complexity. Package RBF is intended for scenarios in which the user cannot\n+change the parent transaction (e.g. they were presigned with an untrusted party), but has control\n+over the child. For example, Package RBF can be used to replace the commitment transaction of an LN\n+counterparty by attaching a high-fee child to an anchor output. If the user later wants to update\n+the child (e.g. a further fee-bump), that can be done using a single transaction.\n+\n+4. The minimum between package feerate and ancestor feerate of the child is not lower than the\n+   individual feerates of all directly conflicting transactions and the ancestor feerates of all\n+   original transactions.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Attempt to ensure that the replacement transactions are not less incentive-compatible\n+to mine.\n+\n+5. The package fee pays an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original transactions.\n+   The additional fees (difference between absolute fee paid by the package after deduplication and the\n+   sum paid by the original transactions) pays for the package's bandwidth at or above the rate set\n+   by the node's incremental relay feerate. For example, if the incremental relay feerate is 1\n+   satoshi/vB and the package after deduplication contains 500 virtual bytes total, then the package\n+   fees after deduplication is at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the original transactions.\n+\n+*Rationale*: These fee-related rules are identical to the replacement [policy for individual\n+transactions](./mempool-replacements.md), treating the package (after deduplication) as one\n+composite transaction. This works because all of the transactions in a\n+child-with-unconfirmed-parents package are in the ancestor set of the child transaction.\n+\n+6. The number of original transactions does not exceed 100.",

      "body": "> I believe this falls short in that the parent V3 transaction can be just south of 101kvB,\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I think this case would be something like: you're trying to confirm tx A which pays no fees itself; your counterparty publishes a package of tx A, B and C; C spends both A and B; A and C are both small, but B is 99kvB with an ephemeral output that is spent by C. You can't replace C without also replacing B because of the ephemeral output.\r\n\r\nWhat you could do, if the ephemeral output is anyone can spend, is replace C in two steps: one that creates tx D that spends B's ephemeral output (it's anyone can spend), which costs you C's fees plus epsilon; then you create tx E that spends A with your desired feerate. So you're paying ~100kvB at the \"backlog\" rate here. \r\n\r\nWith a 4kvB \"related txs\" limit, I think the worst case setup is just A is small (100vB) and is spent by B which is large (3900vB), so you have to pay at least 3.9kvB at the backlog rate plus epsilon to replace it with something smaller, but that's clearly already 25x better. Even if the backlog rate is not much smaller than the next block rate, you're only overpaying by at most 39x rather than perhaps 1000x here.\r\n\r\n> I interpret this to mean that we should change both ancestor and descendant limits to 4000vB. \r\n\r\nHmm, I think the worst case scenario here would still be bad:\r\n\r\n * A is spent by {B1,..,B20} (descendent count = 21 so less than 25)\r\n * B1 also spends C1, B2 also spends C2, etc; all via ephemeral outputs\r\n * A, Bn are 100vB each; Cn is 3800vB each\r\n\r\nA has a descendent size of 2100vB; Bn has an ancestor size of 4000vB and a descendent size of 100vB; Cn has a descendent size of 3900vB. So the 4000vB restriction is okay.\r\n\r\nBut replacing A thus means Bn are invalid, which then means Cn are invalid due to the now unspent ephemeral outputs, which means you're replacing 78kvB in the mempool, not just 4kvB.",

But of course B1 could spend a bunch of things, up to {C1...C23}.\r\n\r\nGood point that with ephemeral outputs replacing a child means we need to remove the parent as well. I'm experimenting with implementing it, and my idea was to require the parent (the one with the dust output) pay 0 fee so it can't stay in the mempool by itself. We'd still want to prevent replacing a large volume of transactions (i.e. include it in the RBF 100 limit), but users/devs don't have to worry about high costs of replacement since its fee is 0?\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about ephemeral outputs but hoping to minimize the scope of this proposal. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems ephemeral outputs are not needed to make package relay work for LN penalty without pinning attacks. We could do ephemeral outputs as a next step - IIUC ephemeral outputs would be a \"loosening\" of policy rules so we could add it on to V3 rules later?",

By always accepting a transaction that passes individual validation before\n trying package validation, we prevent any unintentional restriction of policy.\n+\n+### Package Replace by Fee\n+\n+A package may replace mempool transaction(s) (\"Package RBF\") under the following conditions:\n+\n+1. The package is child-with-parents.\n+\n+*Rationale*: The fee-related rules are economically rational for ancestor packages, but not\n+necessarily other types of packages.\n+\n+However, allowing replacement for all ancestor packages also might not make sense due to the\n+increased complexity.\n+\n+2. At least one of the following signaling conditions is met:\n+\n+    1a. All of the directly conflicting transactions signal BIP125 replaceability explicitly.\n+\n+        *Rationale*: Any transaction that is replaceable without package RBF should still be\n+        replaceable.\n+\n+    1b. All directly conflicting transactions have `nVersion=3` and each package transaction that\n+        conflicts with a mempool transaction also has `nVersion=3`.\n+\n+        *Rationale*: This helps preserve the mempool policy that any transaction spending an\n+        unconfirmed `nVersion=3` transaction must also have `nVersion=3`. Otherwise, the child of a\n+        `nVersion=3` transaction could be replaced by a non-`nVersion=3` transaction, and thus there\n+        would be an `nVersion=3` transaction in the mempool with a non-`nVersion=3` child.\n+\n+        *Rationale*: Since V3 is inherited, this form of RBF signaling is implicitly inherited. That is,\n+        while a V3 transaction is unconfirmed, any descendant(s) accepted to the mempool must also be\n+        V3 and are thus also replaceable.\n+\n+3. The child transaction does not conflict with any transactions in the mempool.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Reduce complexity. Package RBF is intended for scenarios in which the user cannot\n+change the parent transaction (e.g. they were presigned with an untrusted party), but has control\n+over the child. For example, Package RBF can be used to replace the commitment transaction of an LN\n+counterparty by attaching a high-fee child to an anchor output. If the user later wants to update\n+the child (e.g. a further fee-bump), that can be done using a single transaction.\n+\n+4. The minimum between package feerate and ancestor feerate of the child is not lower than the\n+   individual feerates of all directly conflicting transactions and the ancestor feerates of all\n+   original transactions.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Attempt to ensure that the replacement transactions are not less incentive-compatible\n+to mine.\n+\n+5. The package fee pays an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original transactions.\n+   The additional fees (difference between absolute fee paid by the package after deduplication and the\n+   sum paid by the original transactions) pays for the package's bandwidth at or above the rate set\n+   by the node's incremental relay feerate. For example, if the incremental relay feerate is 1\n+   satoshi/vB and the package after deduplication contains 500 virtual bytes total, then the package\n+   fees after deduplication is at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the original transactions.\n+\n+*Rationale*: These fee-related rules are identical to the replacement [policy for individual\n+transactions](./mempool-replacements.md), treating the package (after deduplication) as one\n+composite transaction. This works because all of the transactions in a\n+child-with-unconfirmed-parents package are in the ancestor set of the child transaction.\n+\n+6. The number of original transactions does not exceed 100.",

This lets L2 contracts decide what values are acceptable for each tx type. For example, in the anchor outputs LN-penalty case, we know that commit txs only need an anchor child that can be constrained to be quite small, so commit txs could use a low value here, that can take into account the maximum weight of a commit tx.\r\n\r\nOr would this be adding too much complexity for only a marginal improvement? If so, we should probably bikeshed the protocol hard-coded value and use the lowest value we can to minimize the harm a malicious child tx can do.",

Similar to other fee-related requirements, [package\n+feerate](#Package-Fees-and-Feerate) may allow these transactions to be replaced.\n+\n+A package may replace mempool transaction(s) (\"Package RBF\") under the following conditions:\n+\n+1. All package transactions with mempool conflicts must be V3. This also means the \"sponsoring\"\n+   child transaction must be V3.\n+\n+*Note*: Combined with the V3 rules, this means the package must be a child-with-parents package.\n+Since package validation is only attempted if the transactions do not pay sufficient fees to be\n+accepted on their own, this effectively means that only V3 transactions can pay to replace their\n+parents' conflicts.\n+\n+*Rationale*: The fee-related rules are economically rational for ancestor packages, but not\n+necessarily other types of packages. A child-with-parents package is a type of ancestor package. It\n+may be fine to allow any ancestor package, but it's more difficult to account for all of the\n+possibilities, e.g. descendant limits.\n+\n+2. All original transactions signal replaceability, i.e., either through BIP125 or through being V3.\n+\n+3.

The package fee pays an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original transactions.\n+   The additional fees (difference between absolute fee paid by the package after deduplication and the\n+   sum paid by the original transactions) pays for the package's bandwidth at or above the rate set\n+   by the node's incremental relay feerate. For example, if the incremental relay feerate is 1\n+   satoshi/vB and the package after deduplication contains 500 virtual bytes total, then the package\n+   fees after deduplication is at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the original transactions.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Prevent network-wide DoS where replacements using the same outpoints are relayed over\n+and over again; require the replacement transactions to pay for relay using \"new\" fees. This\n+rule is taken from the [replacement policy for individual transactions](./mempool-replacements.md),\n+treating the package as one composite transaction.\n+\n+5.

Since these contracting transactions are shared between multiple parties and mempool\n+congestion is difficult to predict, mempool policy restrictions may accidentally allow a malicious\n+party to pin a transaction.  The goal here is create a policy for V3 transactions that retains\n+DoS-resistance and accepts transactions that are incentive-compatible to mine, while also avoiding\n+specific pinning attacks.\n+\n+All existing standardness rules apply to V3. The following set of additional restrictions apply to\n+V3 transactions:\n+\n+1. A V3 transaction can be replaced, even if it does not signal BIP125 replaceability. Other\n+   conditions rules apply, see [RBF rules](./mempool-replacements.md) and [Package RBF\n+rules][./packages.md#Package-Replace-By-Fee]. Use the (`-mempoolfullrbf`) configuration option to\n+allow transaction replacement without enforcement of any opt-in signaling rule.\n+\n+2. Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Combined with Rule 1, this gives us the property of \"inherited signaling\" when\n+descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created. Additionally, checking whether a transaction\n+signals replaceability this way does not require mempool traversal, and does not change based on\n+what transactions are mined.\n+\n+*Note*: The descendant of a *confirmed* V3 transaction does not need to be V3.\n+\n+3. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 descendant.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant limit, the more transactions may need to be\n+replaced. This is a problematic pinning attack, i.e., a malicious counterparty prevents the\n+transaction from being replaced by adding many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) at least 1 descendant is required to allow CPFP of the presigned\n+transaction. The contract protocol can create presigned transactions paying 0 fees and 1 output for\n+attaching a CPFP at broadcast time (\"anchor output\"). Without package RBF, multiple anchor outputs\n+would be required to allow each counterparty to fee-bump any presigned transaction. With package\n+RBF, since the presigned transactions can replace each other, 1 anchor output is sufficient.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction that has an unconfirmed V3 ancestor cannot be larger than 1000 virtual bytes.",

By always accepting a transaction that passes individual validation before\n trying package validation, we prevent any unintentional restriction of policy.\n+\n+### Package Replace by Fee\n+\n+A transaction conflicts with an in-mempool transaction (\"directly conflicting transaction\") if they\n+spend one or more of the same inputs. A transaction may conflict with multiple in-mempool\n+transactions. A directly conflicting transaction's and its descendants (together, \"original\n+transactions\") must be evicted in the event of a replacement.\n+\n+A package may contain one or more transactions that have directly conflicting transactions but do\n+not have high enough fees to meet the [replacement policy for individual\n+transactions](./mempool-replacements.md).  Similar to other fee-related requirements, [package\n+feerate](#Package-Fees-and-Feerate) may allow these transactions to be replaced.\n+\n+A package may replace mempool transaction(s) (\"Package RBF\") under the following conditions:\n+\n+1. All package transactions with mempool conflicts must be V3. This also means the \"sponsoring\"\n+   child transaction must be V3.\n+\n+*Note*: Combined with the V3 rules, this means the package must be a child-with-parents package.\n+Since package validation is only attempted if the transactions do not pay sufficient fees to be\n+accepted on their own, this effectively means that only V3 transactions can pay to replace their\n+parents' conflicts.\n+\n+*Rationale*: The fee-related rules are economically rational for ancestor packages, but not\n+necessarily other types of packages. A child-with-parents package is a type of ancestor package. It\n+may be fine to allow any ancestor package, but it's more difficult to account for all of the\n+possibilities, e.g. descendant limits.\n+\n+2. All original transactions signal replaceability, i.e., either through BIP125 or through being V3.\n+\n+3. The minimum between package feerate and ancestor feerate of the child is not lower than the\n+   individual feerates of all directly conflicting transactions and the ancestor feerates of all\n+   original transactions.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Attempt to ensure that the replacement transactions are not less incentive-compatible\n+to mine.\n+\n+4. The package fee pays an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original transactions.\n+   The additional fees (difference between absolute fee paid by the package after deduplication and the\n+   sum paid by the original transactions) pays for the package's bandwidth at or above the rate set\n+   by the node's incremental relay feerate. For example, if the incremental relay feerate is 1\n+   satoshi/vB and the package after deduplication contains 500 virtual bytes total, then the package\n+   fees after deduplication is at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the original transactions.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Prevent network-wide DoS where replacements using the same outpoints are relayed over\n+and over again; require the replacement transactions to pay for relay using \"new\" fees. This\n+rule is taken from the [replacement policy for individual transactions](./mempool-replacements.md),\n+treating the package as one composite transaction.\n+\n+5. The number of original transactions does not exceed 100.",

By always accepting a transaction that passes individual validation before\n trying package validation, we prevent any unintentional restriction of policy.\n+\n+### Package Replace by Fee\n+\n+A transaction conflicts with an in-mempool transaction (\"directly conflicting transaction\") if they\n+spend one or more of the same inputs. A transaction may conflict with multiple in-mempool\n+transactions. A directly conflicting transaction's and its descendants (together, \"original\n+transactions\") must be evicted in the event of a replacement.\n+\n+A package may contain one or more transactions that have directly conflicting transactions but do\n+not have high enough fees to meet the [replacement policy for individual\n+transactions](./mempool-replacements.md).  Similar to other fee-related requirements, [package\n+feerate](#Package-Fees-and-Feerate) may allow these transactions to be replaced.\n+\n+A package may replace mempool transaction(s) (\"Package RBF\") under the following conditions:\n+\n+1. All package transactions with mempool conflicts must be V3. This also means the \"sponsoring\"\n+   child transaction must be V3.\n+\n+*Note*: Combined with the V3 rules, this means the package must be a child-with-parents package.\n+Since package validation is only attempted if the transactions do not pay sufficient fees to be\n+accepted on their own, this effectively means that only V3 transactions can pay to replace their\n+parents' conflicts.\n+\n+*Rationale*: The fee-related rules are economically rational for ancestor packages, but not\n+necessarily other types of packages. A child-with-parents package is a type of ancestor package. It\n+may be fine to allow any ancestor package, but it's more difficult to account for all of the\n+possibilities, e.g. descendant limits.\n+\n+2. All original transactions signal replaceability, i.e., either through BIP125 or through being V3.\n+\n+3. The minimum between package feerate and ancestor feerate of the child is not lower than the\n+   individual feerates of all directly conflicting transactions and the ancestor feerates of all\n+   original transactions.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Attempt to ensure that the replacement transactions are not less incentive-compatible\n+to mine.\n+\n+4. The package fee pays an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original transactions.\n+   The additional fees (difference between absolute fee paid by the package after deduplication and the\n+   sum paid by the original transactions) pays for the package's bandwidth at or above the rate set\n+   by the node's incremental relay feerate. For example, if the incremental relay feerate is 1\n+   satoshi/vB and the package after deduplication contains 500 virtual bytes total, then the package\n+   fees after deduplication is at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the original transactions.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Prevent network-wide DoS where replacements using the same outpoints are relayed over\n+and over again; require the replacement transactions to pay for relay using \"new\" fees. This\n+rule is taken from the [replacement policy for individual transactions](./mempool-replacements.md),\n+treating the package as one composite transaction.\n+\n+5. The number of original transactions does not exceed 100.",

Since these contracting transactions are shared between multiple parties and mempool\n+congestion is difficult to predict, mempool policy restrictions may accidentally allow a malicious\n+party to pin a transaction.  The goal here is create a policy for V3 transactions that retains\n+DoS-resistance and accepts transactions that are incentive-compatible to mine, while also avoiding\n+specific pinning attacks.\n+\n+All existing standardness rules apply to V3. The following set of additional restrictions apply to\n+V3 transactions:\n+\n+1. A V3 transaction can be replaced, even if it does not signal BIP125 replaceability. Other\n+   conditions rules apply, see [RBF rules](./mempool-replacements.md) and [Package RBF\n+rules][./packages.md#Package-Replace-By-Fee]. Use the (`-mempoolfullrbf`) configuration option to\n+allow transaction replacement without enforcement of any opt-in signaling rule.\n+\n+2. Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Combined with Rule 1, this gives us the property of \"inherited signaling\" when\n+descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created. Additionally, checking whether a transaction\n+signals replaceability this way does not require mempool traversal, and does not change based on\n+what transactions are mined.\n+\n+*Note*: The descendant of a *confirmed* V3 transaction does not need to be V3.\n+\n+3. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 descendant.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant limit, the more transactions may need to be\n+replaced. This is a problematic pinning attack, i.e., a malicious counterparty prevents the\n+transaction from being replaced by adding many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) at least 1 descendant is required to allow CPFP of the presigned\n+transaction. The contract protocol can create presigned transactions paying 0 fees and 1 output for\n+attaching a CPFP at broadcast time (\"anchor output\"). Without package RBF, multiple anchor outputs\n+would be required to allow each counterparty to fee-bump any presigned transaction. With package\n+RBF, since the presigned transactions can replace each other, 1 anchor output is sufficient.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction that has an unconfirmed V3 ancestor cannot be larger than 1000 virtual bytes.",

Since these contracting transactions are shared between multiple parties and mempool\n+congestion is difficult to predict, mempool policy restrictions may accidentally allow a malicious\n+party to pin a transaction.  The goal here is create a policy for V3 transactions that retains\n+DoS-resistance and accepts transactions that are incentive-compatible to mine, while also avoiding\n+specific pinning attacks.\n+\n+All existing standardness rules apply to V3. The following set of additional restrictions apply to\n+V3 transactions:\n+\n+1. A V3 transaction can be replaced, even if it does not signal BIP125 replaceability. Other\n+   conditions rules apply, see [RBF rules](./mempool-replacements.md) and [Package RBF\n+rules][./packages.md#Package-Replace-By-Fee]. Use the (`-mempoolfullrbf`) configuration option to\n+allow transaction replacement without enforcement of any opt-in signaling rule.\n+\n+2. Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.",

Since these contracting transactions are shared between multiple parties and mempool\n+congestion is difficult to predict, mempool policy restrictions may accidentally allow a malicious\n+party to pin a transaction.  The goal here is create a policy for V3 transactions that retains\n+DoS-resistance and accepts transactions that are incentive-compatible to mine, while also avoiding\n+specific pinning attacks.\n+\n+All existing standardness rules apply to V3. The following set of additional restrictions apply to\n+V3 transactions:\n+\n+1. A V3 transaction can be replaced, even if it does not signal BIP125 replaceability. Other\n+   conditions rules apply, see [RBF rules](./mempool-replacements.md) and [Package RBF\n+rules][./packages.md#Package-Replace-By-Fee]. Use the (`-mempoolfullrbf`) configuration option to\n+allow transaction replacement without enforcement of any opt-in signaling rule.\n+\n+2. Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Combined with Rule 1, this gives us the property of \"inherited signaling\" when\n+descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created. Additionally, checking whether a transaction\n+signals replaceability this way does not require mempool traversal, and does not change based on\n+what transactions are mined.\n+\n+*Note*: The descendant of a *confirmed* V3 transaction does not need to be V3.\n+\n+3. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 descendant.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant limit, the more transactions may need to be\n+replaced. This is a problematic pinning attack, i.e., a malicious counterparty prevents the\n+transaction from being replaced by adding many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) at least 1 descendant is required to allow CPFP of the presigned\n+transaction. The contract protocol can create presigned transactions paying 0 fees and 1 output for\n+attaching a CPFP at broadcast time (\"anchor output\"). Without package RBF, multiple anchor outputs\n+would be required to allow each counterparty to fee-bump any presigned transaction. With package\n+RBF, since the presigned transactions can replace each other, 1 anchor output is sufficient.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction that has an unconfirmed V3 ancestor cannot be larger than 1000 virtual bytes.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant size limit, the more vbytes may need to be",

From my memory of the mailing list discussions and elsewhere, I think the current state of thinking, directly conflicting transactions versions number are not considered.\r\n\r\nFor the Lightning use-case, this is a significant security advantage as the ~80k of public channels, with all pre-signed revoked commitment transactions V2 can be replaced with newer version=3 package. Revoked commitment transactions, even if the honest counterparty is in knowledge of the revocation secret, are still consensus and policy valid transactions, and as such can be leveraged as pinning means.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think allowing V3 to replace V2 chain of transactions lead to the consequence than V2 users are implicitly subscribing to this new replacement regime. A receiver of a V2 transaction could apply the BIP125 rules to estimate the replacement odd of the transaction, and the application logic be broken when the actual rule 3 of minimum between package feerate and ancestor feerate is applied. I don't know if we're significantly interfering with any Bitcoin application here.",

Indeed, Lightning implementation could just blindly replace-by-fee the pinning transactions, paying up to the channel value. This wouldn't work at all against an attacker pinning with one single malicious transaction multiple channel from different parties where the malicious transaction fee is above the value of each channel. E.g channel A 10000 sats, channel B 25000 sats and channel C 8000 sats. If the malicious pinning transactions fee equals 26000 sats, none of the honest party will rationally fee-bump more than their own channel value. \r\n\r\nFeerate-only replacement rules scales up to the maximum package size and worst historical mempool reduce consideraly the fee-bumping reserves requirement for a LN node, which is a notable advantage I think.",

The following set of additional restrictions apply to\n+V3 transactions:\n+\n+1. A V3 transaction can be replaced, even if it does not signal BIP125 replaceability. Other\n+   conditions rules apply, see [RBF rules](./mempool-replacements.md) and [Package RBF\n+rules][./packages.md#Package-Replace-By-Fee].\n+\n+2. Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Combined with Rule 1, this gives us the property of \"inherited signaling\" when\n+descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created. Additionally, checking whether a transaction\n+signals replaceability this way does not require mempool traversal, and does not change based on\n+what transactions are mined.\n+\n+*Note*: A V3 transaction can spend outputs from *confirmed* non-V3 transactions.\n+\n+3. A V3 transaction's unconfirmed ancestors must all be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Ensure the ancestor feerate rule does not underestimate a to-be-replaced V3 mempool\n+transaction's incentive compatibility. Imagine the original transaction, A, has a child B and\n+co-parent C (i.e. B spends from A and C). C also has another child, D. B is one of the original\n+transactions and thus its ancestor feerate must be lower than the package's. However, this may be an\n+underestimation because D can bump C without B's help. This is resolved if V3 transactions can only\n+have V3 ancestors, as then C cannot have another child.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed descendant.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant limit, the more transactions may need to be\n+replaced. This is a problematic pinning attack, i.e., a malicious counterparty prevents the\n+transaction from being replaced by adding many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping.\n+See example #1 in [\"Rule 3\" Pining](#Rule-3-Pinning) section above.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) at least 1 descendant is required to allow CPFP of the presigned\n+transaction. The contract protocol can create presigned transactions paying 0 fees and 1 output for\n+attaching a CPFP at broadcast time (\"anchor output\"). Without package RBF, multiple anchor outputs\n+would be required to allow each counterparty to fee-bump any presigned transaction. With package\n+RBF, since the presigned transactions can replace each other, 1 anchor output is sufficient.\n+\n+5. A V3 transaction that has an unconfirmed V3 ancestor cannot be larger than 1000 virtual bytes.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant size limit, the more vbytes may need to be\n+replaced. With default limits, if the child is e.g. 100,000vB, that might be an additional\n+100,000sats (at 1sat/vbyte) or more, depending on the feerate. Restricting all children to 1000vB\n+bounds the potential fees by 1/100.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) the smaller this limit, the fewer UTXOs a child may use to fund this\n+fee-bump. For example, only allowing the V3 child to have 2 inputs would require L2 protocols to\n+manage a wallet with high-value UTXOs and make batched fee-bumping impossible. However, as the\n+fee-bumping child only needs to fund fees (as opposed to payments), just a few UTXOs should suffice.\n+\n+*Rationale*: With a limit of 1000 virtual bytes, depending on the output types, the child can have\n+6-15 UTXOs, which should be enough to fund a fee-bump without requiring a carefully-managed UTXO\n+pool. With 1000 virtual bytes as the descendant limit, the cost to replace a V3 transaction has much\n+lower variance.\n+\n+*Rationale*: This makes the rule very easily \"tacked on\" to existing logic for policy and wallets.\n+A transaction may be up to 100KvB on its own (`MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT`) and 101KvB with descendants\n+(`DEFAULT_DESCENDANT_SIZE_LIMIT_KVB`). If an existing V3 transaction in the mempool is 100KvB, its\n+descendant can only be 1000vB, even if the policy is 10KvB.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed ancestor.",

Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Combined with Rule 1, this gives us the property of \"inherited signaling\" when\n+descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created. Additionally, checking whether a transaction\n+signals replaceability this way does not require mempool traversal, and does not change based on\n+what transactions are mined.\n+\n+*Note*: A V3 transaction can spend outputs from *confirmed* non-V3 transactions.\n+\n+3. A V3 transaction's unconfirmed ancestors must all be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Ensure the ancestor feerate rule does not underestimate a to-be-replaced V3 mempool\n+transaction's incentive compatibility. Imagine the original transaction, A, has a child B and\n+co-parent C (i.e. B spends from A and C). C also has another child, D. B is one of the original\n+transactions and thus its ancestor feerate must be lower than the package's. However, this may be an\n+underestimation because D can bump C without B's help. This is resolved if V3 transactions can only\n+have V3 ancestors, as then C cannot have another child.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed descendant.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant limit, the more transactions may need to be\n+replaced. This is a problematic pinning attack, i.e., a malicious counterparty prevents the\n+transaction from being replaced by adding many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping.\n+See example #1 in [\"Rule 3\" Pining](#Rule-3-Pinning) section above.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) at least 1 descendant is required to allow CPFP of the presigned\n+transaction. The contract protocol can create presigned transactions paying 0 fees and 1 output for\n+attaching a CPFP at broadcast time (\"anchor output\"). Without package RBF, multiple anchor outputs\n+would be required to allow each counterparty to fee-bump any presigned transaction. With package\n+RBF, since the presigned transactions can replace each other, 1 anchor output is sufficient.\n+\n+5. A V3 transaction that has an unconfirmed V3 ancestor cannot be larger than 1000 virtual bytes.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant size limit, the more vbytes may need to be\n+replaced. With default limits, if the child is e.g. 100,000vB, that might be an additional\n+100,000sats (at 1sat/vbyte) or more, depending on the feerate. Restricting all children to 1000vB\n+bounds the potential fees by 1/100.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) the smaller this limit, the fewer UTXOs a child may use to fund this\n+fee-bump. For example, only allowing the V3 child to have 2 inputs would require L2 protocols to\n+manage a wallet with high-value UTXOs and make batched fee-bumping impossible. However, as the\n+fee-bumping child only needs to fund fees (as opposed to payments), just a few UTXOs should suffice.\n+\n+*Rationale*: With a limit of 1000 virtual bytes, depending on the output types, the child can have\n+6-15 UTXOs, which should be enough to fund a fee-bump without requiring a carefully-managed UTXO\n+pool. With 1000 virtual bytes as the descendant limit, the cost to replace a V3 transaction has much\n+lower variance.\n+\n+*Rationale*: This makes the rule very easily \"tacked on\" to existing logic for policy and wallets.\n+A transaction may be up to 100KvB on its own (`MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT`) and 101KvB with descendants\n+(`DEFAULT_DESCENDANT_SIZE_LIMIT_KVB`). If an existing V3 transaction in the mempool is 100KvB, its\n+descendant can only be 1000vB, even if the policy is 10KvB.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed ancestor.",

If some of your counterparties have not upgraded their software to support V3 transactions you might have a subset of your channel transaction still under V2 during the transition period. If you have a common child for batched fee-bumping shared between a V2 commitment transaction and V3 commitment transaction, the whole operation is likely to fail. Of course, batch fee-bumping should be considered harmful for time-sensitive commitment transactions (i.e ones with HTLC outputs) though we might have further silent issues even when it's not time-sensitive. In my opinion, this is a potential issue LN devs should be aware of, processing between V2 and V3 channels should be well isolated. ",

Other\n+   conditions rules apply, see [RBF rules](./mempool-replacements.md) and [Package RBF\n+rules][./packages.md#Package-Replace-By-Fee].\n+\n+2. Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Combined with Rule 1, this gives us the property of \"inherited signaling\" when\n+descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created. Additionally, checking whether a transaction\n+signals replaceability this way does not require mempool traversal, and does not change based on\n+what transactions are mined.\n+\n+*Note*: A V3 transaction can spend outputs from *confirmed* non-V3 transactions.\n+\n+3. A V3 transaction's unconfirmed ancestors must all be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Ensure the ancestor feerate rule does not underestimate a to-be-replaced V3 mempool\n+transaction's incentive compatibility. Imagine the original transaction, A, has a child B and\n+co-parent C (i.e. B spends from A and C). C also has another child, D. B is one of the original\n+transactions and thus its ancestor feerate must be lower than the package's. However, this may be an\n+underestimation because D can bump C without B's help. This is resolved if V3 transactions can only\n+have V3 ancestors, as then C cannot have another child.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed descendant.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant limit, the more transactions may need to be\n+replaced. This is a problematic pinning attack, i.e., a malicious counterparty prevents the\n+transaction from being replaced by adding many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping.\n+See example #1 in [\"Rule 3\" Pining](#Rule-3-Pinning) section above.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) at least 1 descendant is required to allow CPFP of the presigned\n+transaction. The contract protocol can create presigned transactions paying 0 fees and 1 output for\n+attaching a CPFP at broadcast time (\"anchor output\"). Without package RBF, multiple anchor outputs\n+would be required to allow each counterparty to fee-bump any presigned transaction. With package\n+RBF, since the presigned transactions can replace each other, 1 anchor output is sufficient.\n+\n+5. A V3 transaction that has an unconfirmed V3 ancestor cannot be larger than 1000 virtual bytes.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant size limit, the more vbytes may need to be\n+replaced. With default limits, if the child is e.g. 100,000vB, that might be an additional\n+100,000sats (at 1sat/vbyte) or more, depending on the feerate. Restricting all children to 1000vB\n+bounds the potential fees by 1/100.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) the smaller this limit, the fewer UTXOs a child may use to fund this\n+fee-bump. For example, only allowing the V3 child to have 2 inputs would require L2 protocols to\n+manage a wallet with high-value UTXOs and make batched fee-bumping impossible. However, as the\n+fee-bumping child only needs to fund fees (as opposed to payments), just a few UTXOs should suffice.\n+\n+*Rationale*: With a limit of 1000 virtual bytes, depending on the output types, the child can have\n+6-15 UTXOs, which should be enough to fund a fee-bump without requiring a carefully-managed UTXO\n+pool. With 1000 virtual bytes as the descendant limit, the cost to replace a V3 transaction has much\n+lower variance.\n+\n+*Rationale*: This makes the rule very easily \"tacked on\" to existing logic for policy and wallets.\n+A transaction may be up to 100KvB on its own (`MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT`) and 101KvB with descendants\n+(`DEFAULT_DESCENDANT_SIZE_LIMIT_KVB`). If an existing V3 transaction in the mempool is 100KvB, its\n+descendant can only be 1000vB, even if the policy is 10KvB.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed ancestor.",

For example, imagine that counterparties Alice (honest) and Mallory (malicious) have\n+conflicting transactions A and B, respectively. Mallory may be able to prevent A from being accepted\n+by first submitting B and taking advantage of some limitations and heuristics used in [RBF\n+policy](./mempool-replacements.md).\n+\n+### \"Rule 3\" Pinning\n+\n+RBF rules require the replacement transaction pay a higher absolute fee than the aggregate fees paid\n+by all original transactions. This means Mallory may increase the fees required to replace B by:\n+\n+1. Adding transaction(s) that descend from B and pay a feerate too low to fee-bump B through CPFP.\n+   For example, assuming the default descendant size limit is 101KvB and B is 1000vB paying a\n+feerate of 2sat/vB, adding a 100KvB, 2sat/vB child increases the cost to replace B by 200Ksat.\n+\n+2. Adding a high-fee descendant of B that also spends from a large, low-feerate mempool transaction,\n+   C. The child may pay a very large fee but not actually be fee-bumping B if its overall ancestor\n+feerate is still lower than B's individual feerate. For example, assuming the default ancestor size\n+limit is 101KvB, B is 1000vB paying 2sat/vB, and C is 99KvB paying 1sat/vB, adding a 1000vB child of\n+B and C increases the cost to replace B by 101Ksat.\n+\n+## Version 3 Rules\n+\n+All existing standardness rules apply to V3. The following set of additional restrictions apply to\n+V3 transactions:\n+\n+1. A V3 transaction can be replaced, even if it does not signal BIP125 replaceability. Other\n+   conditions rules apply, see [RBF rules](./mempool-replacements.md) and [Package RBF\n+rules][./packages.md#Package-Replace-By-Fee].\n+\n+2. Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Combined with Rule 1, this gives us the property of \"inherited signaling\" when\n+descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created. Additionally, checking whether a transaction\n+signals replaceability this way does not require mempool traversal, and does not change based on\n+what transactions are mined.\n+\n+*Note*: A V3 transaction can spend outputs from *confirmed* non-V3 transactions.\n+\n+3. A V3 transaction's unconfirmed ancestors must all be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Ensure the ancestor feerate rule does not underestimate a to-be-replaced V3 mempool\n+transaction's incentive compatibility. Imagine the original transaction, A, has a child B and\n+co-parent C (i.e. B spends from A and C). C also has another child, D. B is one of the original\n+transactions and thus its ancestor feerate must be lower than the package's. However, this may be an\n+underestimation because D can bump C without B's help. This is resolved if V3 transactions can only\n+have V3 ancestors, as then C cannot have another child.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed descendant.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant limit, the more transactions may need to be\n+replaced. This is a problematic pinning attack, i.e., a malicious counterparty prevents the\n+transaction from being replaced by adding many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping.\n+See example #1 in [\"Rule 3\" Pining](#Rule-3-Pinning) section above.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) at least 1 descendant is required to allow CPFP of the presigned\n+transaction. The contract protocol can create presigned transactions paying 0 fees and 1 output for\n+attaching a CPFP at broadcast time (\"anchor output\"). Without package RBF, multiple anchor outputs\n+would be required to allow each counterparty to fee-bump any presigned transaction. With package\n+RBF, since the presigned transactions can replace each other, 1 anchor output is sufficient.\n+\n+5. A V3 transaction that has an unconfirmed V3 ancestor cannot be larger than 1000 virtual bytes.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant size limit, the more vbytes may need to be\n+replaced. With default limits, if the child is e.g. 100,000vB, that might be an additional\n+100,000sats (at 1sat/vbyte) or more, depending on the feerate. Restricting all children to 1000vB\n+bounds the potential fees by 1/100.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) the smaller this limit, the fewer UTXOs a child may use to fund this\n+fee-bump. For example, only allowing the V3 child to have 2 inputs would require L2 protocols to\n+manage a wallet with high-value UTXOs and make batched fee-bumping impossible. However, as the\n+fee-bumping child only needs to fund fees (as opposed to payments), just a few UTXOs should suffice.\n+\n+*Rationale*: With a limit of 1000 virtual bytes, depending on the output types, the child can have\n+6-15 UTXOs, which should be enough to fund a fee-bump without requiring a carefully-managed UTXO\n+pool. With 1000 virtual bytes as the descendant limit, the cost to replace a V3 transaction has much\n+lower variance.\n+\n+*Rationale*: This makes the rule very easily \"tacked on\" to existing logic for policy and wallets.\n+A transaction may be up to 100KvB on its own (`MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT`) and 101KvB with descendants\n+(`DEFAULT_DESCENDANT_SIZE_LIMIT_KVB`). If an existing V3 transaction in the mempool is 100KvB, its\n+descendant can only be 1000vB, even if the policy is 10KvB.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed ancestor.",

Perhaps a constrained V3-only version of #26451 could remove the pin?\r\n\r\nThe asymmetry above is annoying and a mild pinning vector.\r\n\r\nAs of this PR, wallet authors can avoid this pinning scenario entirely by not moving fee utxos between different unconfirmed parents, but it would be nice if asymmetry was avoided to make wallet reasoning simpler.",

For example, imagine that counterparties Alice (honest) and Mallory (malicious) have\n+conflicting transactions A and B, respectively. Mallory may be able to prevent A from being accepted\n+by first submitting B and taking advantage of some limitations and heuristics used in [RBF\n+policy](./mempool-replacements.md).\n+\n+### \"Rule 3\" Pinning\n+\n+RBF rules require the replacement transaction pay a higher absolute fee than the aggregate fees paid\n+by all original transactions. This means Mallory may increase the fees required to replace B by:\n+\n+1. Adding transaction(s) that descend from B and pay a feerate too low to fee-bump B through CPFP.\n+   For example, assuming the default descendant size limit is 101KvB and B is 1000vB paying a\n+feerate of 2sat/vB, adding a 100KvB, 2sat/vB child increases the cost to replace B by 200Ksat.\n+\n+2. Adding a high-fee descendant of B that also spends from a large, low-feerate mempool transaction,\n+   C. The child may pay a very large fee but not actually be fee-bumping B if its overall ancestor\n+feerate is still lower than B's individual feerate. For example, assuming the default ancestor size\n+limit is 101KvB, B is 1000vB paying 2sat/vB, and C is 99KvB paying 1sat/vB, adding a 1000vB child of\n+B and C increases the cost to replace B by 101Ksat.\n+\n+## Version 3 Rules\n+\n+All existing standardness rules apply to V3. The following set of additional restrictions apply to\n+V3 transactions:\n+\n+1. A V3 transaction can be replaced, even if it does not signal BIP125 replaceability. Other\n+   conditions rules apply, see [RBF rules](./mempool-replacements.md) and [Package RBF",

For example, imagine that counterparties Alice (honest) and Mallory (malicious) have\n+conflicting transactions A and B, respectively. Mallory may be able to prevent A from being accepted\n+by first submitting B and taking advantage of some limitations and heuristics used in [RBF\n+policy](./mempool-replacements.md).\n+\n+### \"Rule 3\" Pinning\n+\n+RBF rules require the replacement transaction pay a higher absolute fee than the aggregate fees paid\n+by all original transactions. This means Mallory may increase the fees required to replace B by:\n+\n+1. Adding transaction(s) that descend from B and pay a feerate too low to fee-bump B through CPFP.\n+   For example, assuming the default descendant size limit is 101KvB and B is 1000vB paying a\n+feerate of 2sat/vB, adding a 100KvB, 2sat/vB child increases the cost to replace B by 200Ksat.\n+\n+2. Adding a high-fee descendant of B that also spends from a large, low-feerate mempool transaction,\n+   C. The child may pay a very large fee but not actually be fee-bumping B if its overall ancestor\n+feerate is still lower than B's individual feerate. For example, assuming the default ancestor size\n+limit is 101KvB, B is 1000vB paying 2sat/vB, and C is 99KvB paying 1sat/vB, adding a 1000vB child of\n+B and C increases the cost to replace B by 101Ksat.\n+\n+## Version 3 Rules\n+\n+All existing standardness rules apply to V3. The following set of additional restrictions apply to\n+V3 transactions:\n+\n+1. A V3 transaction can be replaced, even if it does not signal BIP125 replaceability. Other\n+   conditions apply, see [RBF rules](./mempool-replacements.md) and [Package RBF\n+rules][./packages.md#Package-Replace-By-Fee].\n+\n+2. Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Combined with Rule 1, this gives us the property of \"inherited signaling\" when\n+descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created. Additionally, checking whether a transaction\n+signals replaceability this way does not require mempool traversal, and does not change based on\n+what transactions are mined.\n+\n+*Note*: A V3 transaction can spend outputs from *confirmed* non-V3 transactions.\n+\n+3. A V3 transaction's unconfirmed ancestors must all be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Ensure the ancestor feerate rule does not underestimate a to-be-replaced V3 mempool\n+transaction's incentive compatibility. Imagine the original transaction, A, has a child B and\n+co-parent C (i.e. B spends from A and C). C also has another child, D. B is one of the original\n+transactions and thus its ancestor feerate must be lower than the package's. However, this may be an\n+underestimation because D can bump C without B's help. This is resolved if V3 transactions can only\n+have V3 ancestors, as then C cannot have another child.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed descendant.",

A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed descendant.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant limit, the more transactions may need to be\n+replaced. This is a problematic pinning attack, i.e., a malicious counterparty prevents the\n+transaction from being replaced by adding many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping.\n+See example #1 in [\"Rule 3\" Pining](#Rule-3-Pinning) section above.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) at least 1 descendant is required to allow CPFP of the presigned\n+transaction. The contract protocol can create presigned transactions paying 0 fees and 1 output for\n+attaching a CPFP at broadcast time (\"anchor output\"). Without package RBF, multiple anchor outputs\n+would be required to allow each counterparty to fee-bump any presigned transaction. With package\n+RBF, since the presigned transactions can replace each other, 1 anchor output is sufficient.\n+\n+5. A V3 transaction that has an unconfirmed V3 ancestor cannot be larger than 1000 virtual bytes.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant size limit, the more vbytes may need to be\n+replaced. With default limits, if the child is e.g. 100,000vB, that might be an additional\n+100,000sats (at 1sat/vbyte) or more, depending on the feerate. Restricting all children to 1000vB\n+bounds the potential fees by 1/100.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) the smaller this limit, the fewer UTXOs a child may use to fund this\n+fee-bump. For example, only allowing the V3 child to have 2 inputs would require L2 protocols to\n+manage a wallet with high-value UTXOs and make batched fee-bumping impossible. However, as the\n+fee-bumping child only needs to fund fees (as opposed to payments), just a few UTXOs should suffice.\n+\n+*Rationale*: With a limit of 1000 virtual bytes, depending on the output types, the child can have\n+6-15 UTXOs, which should be enough to fund a fee-bump without requiring a carefully-managed UTXO\n+pool. With 1000 virtual bytes as the descendant limit, the cost to replace a V3 transaction has much\n+lower variance.\n+\n+*Rationale*: This makes the rule very easily \"tacked on\" to existing logic for policy and wallets.\n+A transaction may be up to 100KvB on its own (`MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT`) and 101KvB with descendants\n+(`DEFAULT_DESCENDANT_SIZE_LIMIT_KVB`). If an existing V3 transaction in the mempool is 100KvB, its\n+descendant can only be 1000vB, even if the policy is 10KvB.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed ancestor.",

Other\n+   conditions apply, see [RBF rules](./mempool-replacements.md) and [Package RBF\n+rules][./packages.md#Package-Replace-By-Fee].\n+\n+2. Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Combined with Rule 1, this gives us the property of \"inherited signaling\" when\n+descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created. Additionally, checking whether a transaction\n+signals replaceability this way does not require mempool traversal, and does not change based on\n+what transactions are mined.\n+\n+*Note*: A V3 transaction can spend outputs from *confirmed* non-V3 transactions.\n+\n+3.
