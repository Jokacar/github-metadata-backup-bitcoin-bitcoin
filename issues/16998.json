    "body": "Steps to reproduce :\r\n\r\nConfigure with `--enable-debug` and run with `-checkblockindex=1` .\r\n\r\n1. invalidateblock ...\r\n2. reconsiderblock ...\r\n\r\nProgress for reconsiderblock stops at some point, at least in the log. But CPU activity remains at 100%. It seems to happen shortly after it connects to new peers. Calling `setnetworkactive false` before reconsiderblock seems to prevent the issue.\r\n\r\nctrl + c will not stop bitcoind, it doesn't go beyond \"addcon thread exit\" and\r\n\"net thread exit\".\r\n\r\nWhen running QT, it becomes completely unresponsive.\r\n\r\n`bitcoin-cli stop` will say \"Bitcoin Core stopping\", but that's a lie.\r\n\r\nIn addition, calling `reconsiderblock` very early after start, before you see `ERROR: AcceptBlockHeader: block 0000000000000000000212eb9b17aeb6e2a1527923ba79527cd8373f1d44307d is marked invalid`, will prevent the chain from moving until you force-quit.\r\n\r\nLaunching bitcoind without `-checkblockindex=1` doesn't seem to have this issue. \r\n\r\nTried on master @ c3a8e097b1afe27bce2f71817fd23cb857236d9d.\r\n",

And in process viewers, I can see that there's a single thread blocking ALL other threads in a tight loop using 100% CPU in a tight loop.\r\n\r\nI've seen that this is occurs in any db indexer (notably the chainstate indexer during IBD, or the txindexer, or the coinstat db indexer), notably in some critical steps where new blocks are added to the chain (once every about 15 minutes). This seems to happen when a new block contains a transaction validating a better chain, and invalidating other blocks from dead branches. In that case, the ongoin indexer will fail with unchecked conditions in its internal iterator, apparently because it expect the next block to be present and locks it incorrectly, and is not able to release it and retry if that next valid block has been replaced by a better block in the chain.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-08-21T19:44:15.875834Z [net_processing.cpp:2797] [ProcessMessage] New outbound peer

indexer (note the difference of time between the last too events). And in fact nothing else occured: no resposes to other peers, the coindb indexer was stalled, the RPC service stopped to respond even locally.\r\n\r\nIt seems then that there are malicious nodes on the P2P network sending bad blocks that \"partially pass\" the basic security, but can cause BitCoin Core to be blocked and become unresponsive. It can no longer respond even to a basic RPC such as \"bitcoin -getinfo\", or \"bitcoin -netinfo\"\r\n\r\nIt will not even repond to a \"bitcoin-cli stop\": some threads are stopped, but not all, and the indexer thread is still running in its tight loop; if you are in that situation, the only way to recover is to KILL the process entirely, and you'll get the related index to become invalid as it was not committed, it will have to be reconstructed from zero.\r\n\r\nMost often, you have no way to recover (given that the RPC service is not responsive, and even the CTRL+C breaker, or a simple kill -hangup\" will not work. You have to do an instant kill (kill -9 on Linux, or manual kill in the Process Viewer on Windows: nothing else will be synced to disk).\r\n\r\nIf the index was the IBD index, the chainstate can only be recovered by check level 4 (works often, but not necessarily always, but never with check level 3). If it does not work, then you have to rebuild the chainstate entirely.\r\n\r\nBut for any other index (such as the \"txindex\" or \"coinstats\" index, there's NO check at all with recovery at startup, so the only way to recover is to entirely delete the content of that index directory and rebuild it from zero (and this will take many hours, and may fail again in the middle, due to bad blocks sent by malicious peers and that may have still not been replaced by valid blocks in the main chain).\r\n\r\nApparently these bad blocks seem to come from unapproved forks (possibly implementing SegWit with too large block sizes?), which are not correctly detected and cause the indexer to fail or run into some infinite loops, or some bad signatures using unsupported/snon-standard bytecodes, taking extremely long time to validate or just discard rapidly as invalid.\r\n\r\nSuch events with bad blocks coming from malicious peers tend to be frequent now. Unfortunately it's not easy to track which nodes caused that bug as they may not even be connected since long: they have sent their garbage and have disconnected themselves as soon as done, just to crash specific versions of Bitcoin Core not detecting them.\r\n\r\n(Note: this is once again occuring with the current unmodified release v23.0 from your official site; it affects both Linux and Windows versions).\r\n\r\nAre there blocks that are extremely long to validate or index (taking much more than just about 1 minutes normally needed here to process every logged group of about 15 blocks, such as more than 30 minutes in the 1st break above, but still not completed after several hours at end of the logs above)? Isn't it one of the reasons why SegWit was asked for, with blocks grouping many signatures, for example those generated by very large miner pools and needing tons of transactions to validate all their micropayments to many participants?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSee also Bug https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25365 (may be related with the same race issue when there's a new chaintip updated while the indexer is running and iterating from the older chain view)\r\n\r\nIf this is the cause, the bug is manifested only when you run it on a machine with enough cores to allow more threads to run concurrently. The crashes/hangs I experiment are all runing with 8 cores activates; your test environment may just have 1 or 2 cores configured, most probably not enough to experiment the race issue between concurrent threads, and not experienced by people running it on cheap PC or notebooks, or in cheap/free VMs for Azure and Amazon (if you get just 1 or 2 non dedicated cores).\r\n\r\nNote also that synchronization issues in code may even more likely to cause bugs on CPUs running multiple threads per core, or using more complex parallelism (e.g. new Intel processors with power-efficient and performance CPUs, with more complex caching layers, or needing special kernel-initiated firmware mitigations like Retpoline against attacks based on latency response time on caches and with speculative execution models; those possibile attacks and firmware or OS mitigations exist on many processors, and their effect on execution latency may vary, depending on the number of active concurrent threads; if you have low I/O latency on disk storage, this will also increase the likelyhood of race issues caused by improper synchronization. But in all these cases this greatly impacts the leveldb indexers, not properly iterating over the main chain of blocks.)\r\n\r\nIf you want to experiment it faster, you may want to test it on a machine with many more CPU cores, like newest AMD ThreadRipper (48 concurrent threads!). And then try running multiple indexers running in parallel (the chainstate indexer in IBD, the coinsdbindexer, the txindex, and the coinsdbindex: one of them will crash/hand, or report \"data corruption\", but not caused by any hardware issue, but incorrect synchronization in Bitcoin Core's code).\r\n\r\nAs well it seems that all bugs like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25894 (reported quite often, but always diagnosed in replies\" incorrectly as a \"hardware issue\", just supposed but never really verified) are also related to the same synchronization issues between any indexer thread and the thread handling any changes of the tips on the chainstate (notably if there's a change between concurrent forks for new blocks after establishing a consensus. They more likely occurs at end of a trading day, when more blocks are announced for compensating transactions made by major traders (it's then more frequent to get new blocks emitted more rapidly than just once every 10 minutes during the rest of the day.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSubsidiary question: Is there way to have a knonw list of trustable peers, and a blacklist for bad peers sending fake/corrupted data? Isn't Bitcoin missing some additional checks of the structure of these blocks (not just the validation of the individual attempted transactions, but basically its assumed format, includnig for complex multipart signature schemes, or peers attempting to force the use of a hard fork with a disappoved BIP proposal, or attemping to use it too early before a valid date and proper nogociation, if they run some specific subchains)?\r\n\r\nOne remote peer I remarked was always present when I saw crashes/hangs was this one:\r\n\r\n<->   type   net  mping   ping send recv  txn  blk  hb addrp addrl  age id address                     version\r\nout   full  ipv6     27     27    4    1    0           1002          1 11 [2001:41d0:303:2b2b::]:8333 70015/Satoshi:0.14.2(bitcore-sl)/UASF-Segwit:1.0(BIP148)/\r\n\r\nI've seen it several times sending groups of 2 or 3 unconfirmed blocks with large transactions in a row. It is likely a non-upgraded miner node.\r\n\r\n(According to WHOIS, is is hosted by OVH in France, and likely on a fiber access; it uses the most antique version of Satoshi I seen for a \"full node\", but with local patches trying to enforce BIP148 but with wrong version announcements).\r\n\r\nDo I need to list it in my banlist?",
