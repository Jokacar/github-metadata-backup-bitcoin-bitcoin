    "body": "This PR adds test coverage for the following check in `TxOrphanage::AddTx`, where large orphan txs are ignored in order to avoid memory exhaustion attacks:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5abb9b1af49be9024f95fa2f777285c531785d85/src/txorphanage.cpp#L22-L34\r\nNote that this code-path isn't reachable under normal circumstances, as txs larger than `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT` are already rejected earlier in the course of doing the mempool standardness checks (see `MemPoolAccept::PreChecks` -> `IsStandardTx` -> `reason = \"tx-size\";`), so this is only relevant if tx standardness rules are disabled via `-acceptnonstdtxns=1`. The ignore path is checked by asserting the debug log, which is ugly, but as far as I know there is currently no way to access the orphanage entries from the outside. As an alternative to adding test coverage, one might consider removing this check altogether (or replacing it with an `Assume`), as it's redundant as explained above.",

Worked well.\r\n\r\n> The ignore path is checked by asserting the debug log, which is ugly, but as far as I know there is currently no way to access the orphanage entries from the outside. As an alternative to adding test coverage, one might consider removing this check altogether (or replacing it with an Assume), as it's redundant as explained above.\r\n\r\nRPC already has a way to get mempool transactions (e.g. `getrawmempool` and `getmempoolentry`), but as far as I can tell, not orphans. Unless I'm overlooking something (or there's a history I'm not aware of), might be nice to have a `getorphantxs` (returning orphan txids, etc.) and `getorphan \"txid\"` (details for an orphan). Orphans do expire relatively quickly, so results from these RPC would be pretty ephemeral, but it might still be worth knowing. I'm taking a look at implementation options.\r\n\r\nAn added bonus would be that `p2p_orphan_handling` could call `getorphantxs` directly (rather than search the debug log). If others agree that these new RPCs are worthwhile, then the RPCs should be implemented in a separate/followup PR, and in my opinion shouldn't impact this PR getting merged (an adjustment of the test could be done later).",
