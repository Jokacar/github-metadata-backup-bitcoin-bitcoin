    "body": "The timeout interval for the send and recv buffers was changed from 90\r\nminutes to 20 minutes in commit f1920e86 in 2013, except for peers that\r\ndid not support the pong message (where the recv buffer timeout remained\r\nat 90 minutes). A few observations:\r\n\r\n- for peers that support BIP 31 (pong messages), this recv buffer\r\n  timeout is almost redundant with the ping timeout. We send a ping\r\n  message every two minutes, and set a timeout of twenty minutes to\r\n  receive the pong response. If the recv buffer was really timing out,\r\n  then the pong response would also time out.\r\n- BIP 31 is supported by all nodes of p2p version 60000 and higher, and\r\n  has been in widespread use since 2013. I'd be very surprised if there\r\n  are many nodes on the network that don't support pong messages.\r\n- The recv buffer timeout is not specified in any p2p BIP. We're free to\r\n  set it at any value we want.\r\n- A peer that doesn't support BIP 31 and hasn't sent any message to us\r\n  at all in 90 minutes is unlikely to be useful for us, and is more likely\r\n  to be evicted AttemptToEvictConnection() since it'll have the worst\r\n  possible ping time and isn't providing blocks/transactions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we remove this check, and set the recv buffer timeout to 20\r\nminutes for all peers. This removes the final p2p version dependent\r\nlogic from the net layer, so all p2p version data can move into the\r\nnet_processing layer.\r\n\r\nAlternative approaches:\r\n\r\n- Set the recv buffer timeout to 90 minutes for all peers. This almost\r\n  wouldn't be a behaviour change at all (pre-BIP 31 peers would still\r\n  have the same recv buffer timeout, and we can't ever reach a recv buffer\r\n  timeout higher than 21 minutes for post-BIP31 peers, because the pong\r\n  timeout would be hit first).\r\n- Stop supporting peers that don't support BIP 31. BIP 31 has been in\r\n  use since 2012, and implementing it is trivial.",

      "message": "[net] Make p2p recv buffer timeout 20 minutes for all peers\n\nThe timeout interval for the send and recv buffers was changed from 90\nminutes to 20 minutes in commit f1920e86 in 2013, except for peers that\ndid not support the pong message (where the recv buffer timeout remained\nat 90 minutes). A few observations:\n\n- for peers that support BIP 31 (pong messages), this recv buffer\n  timeout is almost redundant with the ping timeout. We send a ping\n  message every two minutes, and set a timeout of twenty minutes to\n  receive the pong response. If the recv buffer was really timing out,\n  then the pong response would also time out.\n- BIP 31 is supported by all nodes of p2p version 60000 and higher, and\n  has been in widespread use since 2013. I'd be very surprised if there\n  are many nodes on the network that don't support pong messages.\n- The recv buffer timeout is not specified in any p2p BIP. We're free to\n  set it at any value we want.\n- A peer that doesn't support BIP 31 and hasn't sent any message to us\n  at all in 90 minutes is unlikely to be useful for us, and is more likely\n  to be evicted AttemptToEvictConnection() since it'll have the worst\n  possible ping time and isn't providing blocks/transactions.\n\nTherefore, we remove this check, and sent the recv buffer timeout to 20\nminutes for all peers. This removes the final p2p version dependent\nlogic from the net layer, so all p2p version data can move into the\nnet_processing layer.\n\nAlternative approaches:\n\n- Set the recv buffer timeout to 90 minutes for all peers. This almost\n  wouldn't be a behaviour change at all (pre-BIP 31 peers would still\n  have the same recv buffer timeout, and we can't ever reach a recv buffer\n  timeout higher than 21 minutes for post-BIP31 peers, because the pong\n  timeout would be hit first).\n- Stop supporting peers that don't support BIP 31. BIP 31 has been in\n  use since 2012, and implementing it is trivial.",

          "title": "Move remaining application layer data to net processing",
          "body": "The application layer is any data that is transmitted within P2P message payloads, and the processing of that data. Examples are tx inventory, addr gossiping, ping/pong processing.\r\n\r\n`CNode` currently contains many data and function members that are concerned with the application layer. These should be moved into net processing, so that `CNode` is only concerned with the network layer (sending/receiving bytes, keeping statistics, eviction logic, etc).\r\n\r\nOne blocker to moving these is that the existing peer data structure in net processing is `CNodeState`, which is guarded by cs_main. Moving all application layer data into `CNodeState` would expand where we need to take and hold cs_main locks. Instead, we should create a new data structure in net processing called `Peer` which doesn't require a cs_main lock, and move the application layer data there.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/2020-06-cnode-comments is a move/comment only branch that re-orders the `CNode` data members into logical groups and adds comments for each member, including TODOs for members that should be moved to net processing. The branch isn't intended for merging, but is a guide for what I think needs to change in `CNode`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/2020-06-cs-main-split is a branch that implements `Peer` and starts moving application layer data into that structure. I intend to peel off commits from that branch into separate PRs. That branch also starts moving data that doesn't require the cs_main lock from `CNodeState` into `Peer`. Longer term, I believe almost all `CNodeState` data can be moved into `Peer`, greatly reducing the scope that cs_main locks are held in net processing.\r\n\r\nAny help reviewing or implementing these changes would be very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nPRs:\r\n\r\n- [x] #19219 Replace automatic bans with discouragement filter\r\n- [x] #19472 Reduce cs_main scope in MaybeDiscourageAndDisconnect()\r\n- [x] #19583 clean up Misbehaving()\r\n- [x] #19607 Add Peer struct for per-peer data in net processing\r\n- [x] #19910 Move peer_map to PeerManager\r\n- [x] #20624 Remove nStartingHeight check from block relay\r\n- [x] #19829 Move block inventory state to net_processing\r\n- [x] #20651 Make p2p recv buffer timeout 20 minutes for all peers\r\n- [x] #20811 Move net_processing implementation details out of header\r\n- [x] #20927 Clean up InactivityCheck()\r\n- [x] #20721 Move ping data to net_processing\r\n- [x] #21187 Only call PushAddress() from net_processing\r\n- [x] #21236 Extract `addr` send functionality into MaybeSendAddr()\r\n- [x] #21186 Move addr data into net_processing\r\n- [x] #21162 Move RelayTransaction() into PeerManager\r\n- [x] #21160 Move tx data into net_processing\r\n\r\n<details><summary><code>CNode</code> with comments.

Only touches one line of code so hopefully shouldn't interfere with any other PRs in the works. Don't think it has any denial-of-service impact; buggy nodes all seem like they'll announce bip31 compliant version numbers anyway, and people doing deliberate attacks can just do ping/pong to keep the connection open anyway.",
