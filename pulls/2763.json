Since at least @genjix is MIA, we probably also need to discuss how to handle such actions when BIP champions disappear - BIP 1 allows for me to assign an additional champion to take over, but I'm not sure anyone would necessarily _want_ to do so in this case.\n\nBIP 50: Proposed action items, including the hardfork, are completed. @gavinandresen\n\nBIP 60: BIP 37 was apparently not clear on whether the new \"relay transactions\" flag was mandatory or optional. BIP 60 sought to explicitly make it mandatory. In parallel, Jeff Garzik interpreted BIP 37's field as mandatory in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2534 and Pieter Wuille implemented the changes required for that (and BIP 60) in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2763 . Numerous forks of Bitcoin Core since then have also picked up this change. @genjix\n\nBIP 64: The getutxo message was implemented for use between (pre-contentious hardforks) Bitcoin XT and Lighthouse. Both of these are unmaintained now, but this does not seem relevant. @mikehearn\n\nBIP 66: Softfork accepted by a supermajority of miners. @sipa\n\nBIP 73: Implemented by at least Bitcoin Core and BitPay. @gasteve\n",

Since @genjix is MIA, and @mikehearn ignores Bitcoin, we need to discuss how to handle such actions when BIP champions disappear - BIP 1 allows for me to assign an additional champion to take over, but I'm not sure anyone would necessarily want to do so in these cases.\n\nBIP 60: BIP 37 was apparently not clear on whether the new \"relay transactions\" flag was mandatory or optional. BIP 60 sought to explicitly make it mandatory. In parallel, Jeff Garzik interpreted BIP 37's field as mandatory in bitcoin/bitcoin#2534 and Pieter Wuille implemented the changes required for that (and BIP 60) in bitcoin/bitcoin#2763 . Numerous forks of Bitcoin Core since then have also picked up this change.\n\nBIP 64: The getutxo message was implemented for use between (pre-contentious hardforks) Bitcoin XT and Lighthouse. Both of these are unmaintained now, but this does not seem relevant.\n",
