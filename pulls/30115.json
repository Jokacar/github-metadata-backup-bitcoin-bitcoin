    "body": "These are the simple (and hopefully obviously correct) copies that can be moves instead.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30094#issuecomment-2108751842\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, there are hundreds of places where we copy UniValues needlessly. It should be the case that moves are always preferred over copies, so there should be no downside to these changes.\r\n\r\n@willcl-ark, however, noticed that memory usage may increase in some cases. Logically this makes no sense to me. The only plausible explanation imo is that because the moves are faster, more ops/second occur in some cases.\r\n\r\nThis list of moves was obtained by changing the function signatures of the UniValue functions to accept only rvalues, then compiling and fixing them up one by one. There still exist many places where copies are being made. These can/should be fixed up, but weren't done here for the sake of doing the easy ones first.\r\n\r\nI ran these changes through clang-tidy with `performance-move-const-arg` and `bugprone-use-after-move` and no bugs were detected (though that's obviously not to say it can be trusted 100%).\r\n\r\nAs stated above, there are still lots of other less trivial fixups to do after these including:\r\n- Using non-const UniValues where possible so that moves can happen\r\n- Refactoring code in order to be able to move a UniValue without introducing a use-after-move\r\n- Refactoring functions to accept UniValues by value rather than by const reference",

UniValue copies are reasonable in many cases, but our use of them often lends itself to moving. So we can't detect and disable copies as a rule, and (I assume) if clang-tidy could detect and suggest possible moves as optimizations, it would be offering a generic version of that already.\r\n\r\nHere's an upstream discussion about it that has apparently gone stale: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/53489",

(There was a `DISABLE_IMPLICIT_COPIES` macro proposed in #24641 that tried to do this, but it didn't seem possible to generalize the implementation so we never added it.) It think it would be probably be reasonable to allow univalue to be explicitly but not implicitly copied, but I'm sure @theuni would have a better intuition.",

Logically this makes no sense to me. The only plausible explanation imo is that because the moves are faster, more ops/second occur in some cases.\r\n\r\nI still have not been able to explain why i see these type of results, but I think it's most likely user error somewhere along the line.\r\n\r\nHere is one example of a puzzling result I have, in this test fetching every 5000th block via REST (previously largely addressed by #30094). In all screenshots **this PR is on the right hand side**:\r\n\r\nWe can see here this PR made 96m allocations, vs 137m, a strict improvement?\r\n\r\n![screenshot_20240517-131022](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/158b4f0d-2509-498c-b9d6-857b86c44570)\r\n\r\nThe unnecessary calls to allocator functions are clearly gotten rid of:\r\n\r\n![screenshot_20240517-131039](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/731fdcec-bdb5-423d-aa60-4ae7a3529b3c)\r\n\r\nHowever despite that total resource usage increases, albeit only a little, ~10MB (also see first image) :\r\n\r\n![screenshot_20240517-131046](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/a120b44e-8db7-42e4-b61b-03740f7f1893)\r\n\r\n![easy-univalue-moves-comparison](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/c89ab584-536f-4086-9e92-a0de07d81562)\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR which affect this test (since #30094) are in [core_write.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30115/files#diff-48fa743e653b0ceebb1e454766c5a2e70981a44503eca6adf24895016db9eb26)\r\n\r\nI guess this may just be allocator stuff I might never get to the bottom of, but I will continue to investigate this for a little bit before bringing a full ACK back :)\r\n\r\nFWIW these changes **did** provide a measurable speedup on my test, roughly of this order:\r\n\r\n- this PR: ~ 1:43\r\n- master: ~ 1:55\r\n\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nI also see similar result just fetching a single block (in this case block 800,000). Many fewer allocations, but larger total usage:\r\n\r\n![screenshot_20240517-134351](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/24721337-4151-4693-8789-6661115f32e1)\r\n\r\n![screenshot_20240517-134513](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/cf711912-bd96-4de5-ab9f-56ef8aab720f)\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the clues may lie in here, but I am too dumb to know what they are. For some reason after this PR a second ~30MB allocation is made. Without this PR there are 37.2MB and 24.0MB allocations made,, and with this PR those are 38.2MB and 30.9MB, and I don't understand why:\r\n\r\n![screenshot_20240517-135346](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/9a471ba8-254b-4b6c-bde8-458c431e4ab8)\r\n\r\nheaptrack dumps in case anyone else wants to take a look:\r\n\r\n[heaptrack_dumps.zip](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/15349481/heaptrack_dumps.zip)\r\n\r\n",
