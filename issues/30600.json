    "title": "use MiniWallet in functional test `rpc_signrawtransactionwithkey.py` for funding txs",
    "body": "### Motivation\n\nThe functional test `rpc_signrawtransactionwithkey.py` currently creates funding transactions by spending the coinbases of newly mined blocks, which is rather slow and leads to unnecessary complex code (see method [`send_to_address`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2987ba66375863cdfb0e6065a36c5d3302499c0b/test/functional/rpc_signrawtransactionwithkey.py#L52)). It would be simpler to use a [MiniWallet](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2987ba66375863cdfb0e6065a36c5d3302499c0b/test/functional/test_framework/wallet.py#L90) instance for that purpose, in combination with the pre-generated test chain which already contains UTXOs for MiniWallet's default mode `ADDRESS_OP_TRUE`. That way, the test code is not cluttered with low-level tx details of funding tx creation and more readable. While touching the test, other small improvements could be considered as well (e.g. do we really need spin up two different nodes to achieve our testing goals?).\n\n### Possible solution\n\n_No response_\n\n### Useful Skills\n\n* Basic Python 3 skills\r\n* Basic understanding of transactions, difference between output scripts and addresses\r\n* Being familiar with MiniWallet's capabilities (how to send funds to an arbitrary output script?)\r\n\n\n### Guidance for new contributors\n\nWant to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
