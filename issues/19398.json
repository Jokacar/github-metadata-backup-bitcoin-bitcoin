    "title": "Move remaining application layer data to net processing",
    "body": "The application layer is any data that is transmitted within P2P message payloads, and the processing of that data. Examples are tx inventory, addr gossiping, ping/pong processing.\r\n\r\n`CNode` currently contains many data and function members that are concerned with the application layer. These should be moved into net processing, so that `CNode` is only concerned with the network layer (sending/receiving bytes, keeping statistics, eviction logic, etc).\r\n\r\nOne blocker to moving these is that the existing peer data structure in net processing is `CNodeState`, which is guarded by cs_main. Moving all application layer data into `CNodeState` would expand where we need to take and hold cs_main locks. Instead, we should create a new data structure in net processing called `Peer` which doesn't require a cs_main lock, and move the application layer data there.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/2020-06-cnode-comments is a move/comment only branch that re-orders the `CNode` data members into logical groups and adds comments for each member, including TODOs for members that should be moved to net processing. The branch isn't intended for merging, but is a guide for what I think needs to change in `CNode`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/2020-06-cs-main-split is a branch that implements `Peer` and starts moving application layer data into that structure. I intend to peel off commits from that branch into separate PRs. That branch also starts moving data that doesn't require the cs_main lock from `CNodeState` into `Peer`. Longer term, I believe almost all `CNodeState` data can be moved into `Peer`, greatly reducing the scope that cs_main locks are held in net processing.\r\n\r\nAny help reviewing or implementing these changes would be very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nPRs:\r\n\r\n- [x] #19219 Replace automatic bans with discouragement filter\r\n- [x] #19472 Reduce cs_main scope in MaybeDiscourageAndDisconnect()\r\n- [x] #19583 clean up Misbehaving()\r\n- [x] #19607 Add Peer struct for per-peer data in net processing\r\n- [x] #19910 Move peer_map to PeerManager\r\n- [x] #20624 Remove nStartingHeight check from block relay\r\n- [x] #19829 Move block inventory state to net_processing\r\n- [x] #20651 Make p2p recv buffer timeout 20 minutes for all peers\r\n- [x] #20811 Move net_processing implementation details out of header\r\n- [x] #20927 Clean up InactivityCheck()\r\n- [x] #20721 Move ping data to net_processing\r\n- [x] #21187 Only call PushAddress() from net_processing\r\n- [x] #21236 Extract `addr` send functionality into MaybeSendAddr()\r\n- [x] #21186 Move addr data into net_processing\r\n- [x] #21162 Move RelayTransaction() into PeerManager\r\n- [x] #21160 Move tx data into net_processing\r\n\r\n<details><summary><code>CNode</code> with comments.

Instead of checking `setInventoryTxToSend`, maintain an explicit bloom filter with the 3500 most recently announced invs, and permit fetching any of these as long as they're in the relay pool or the mempool. In addition, permit relay from the mempool after just 2 minutes instead of 15.\r\n\r\nThis:\r\n\r\n* Fixes the brief opportunity an attacker has to request unannounced invs just after the connection is established (pointed out by naumenkogs, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18861#issuecomment-627627010).\r\n* Guarantees that locally resubmitted invs after `filterInventoryKnown` rolls over can still be requested (pointed out by luke-jr, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18861#discussion_r419695831).\r\n\r\nIt adds 37 KiB of filter per peer.\r\n\r\nThis is also a step towards dropping the relay pool entirely and always relaying from the mempool directly (see #17303), but that is still blocked by dealing properly with NOTFOUNDs (see #18238).",

          "body": "We currently have two structures for per-peer data:\r\n\r\n- `CNode` in net, which should just contain connection layer data (eg socket, send/recv buffers, etc), but currently also contains some application layer data (eg tx/block inventory).\r\n- `CNodeState` in net processing, which contains p2p application layer data, but requires cs_main to be locked for access.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a third struct `Peer`, which is for p2p application layer data, and doesn't require cs_main. Eventually all application layer data from `CNode` should be moved to `Peer`, and any data that doesn't strictly require cs_main should be moved from `CNodeState` to `Peer` (probably all of `CNodeState` eventually).\r\n\r\n`Peer` objects are stored as shared pointers in a net processing global map `g_peer_map`, which is protected by `g_peer_mutex`. To use a `Peer` object, `g_peer_mutex` is locked, a copy of the shared pointer is taken, and the lock is released. Individual members of `Peer` are protected by different mutexes that guard related data. The lifetime of the `Peer` object is managed by the shared_ptr refcount.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `Peer` object and moves the misbehaving data from `CNodeState` to `Peer`. This allows us to immediately remove 15 `LOCK(cs_main)` instances.\r\n\r\nFor more motivation see #19398",

      "body": "> One blocker to moving these is that the existing peer data structure in net processing is CNodeState, which is guarded by cs_main. Moving all application layer data into CNodeState would expand where we need to take and hold cs_main locks. Instead, we should create a new data structure in net processing called Peer which doesn't require a cs_main lock, and move the application layer data there.\r\n\r\nCould you explain why this is a blocker?  In practice, most of our net code is single-threaded anyway (one message processing thread), so my intuition is that there are limited places where it's actually problematic that we might hold cs_main longer.  Could you point me to those places where it'd be a concern?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that there are two things going on here: one is moving application layer code to `net_processing` data structures and out of `net` data structures, which seems like an obvious win to me (adding some new p2p features can be tedious because of the current split).  The other is redoing the locking, which is less clear to me; I can imagine some potential use cases, but given our current architecture and behavior it's not clear to me that it's necessary to make changes here at the same time, as I don't expect there to be any real improvements until someone proposes more fundamental changes to our message processing logic.\r\n\r\nAlso, relating to the moving of data structures between `net` and `net_processing`, I think it'll be important to understand what you imagine the interface between those two modules to look like.  For instance I think we've run into implementation difficulties/complexity when writing code that is right at the intersection of those two things -- such as stale tip checking, block-relay-only peer negotiation, eviction logic for inbound peers, etc -- so it would be helpful in a new design to talk about how you envision that working.  \r\n\r\nI suppose understanding how you expect the locking/synchronization to work would make sense as well, as that might also show how tightly coupled these changes are?\r\n\r\n(A gist that explains all this at a high level would be very helpful.)",

      "body": "> Could you explain why this is a blocker? In practice, most of our net code is single-threaded anyway (one message processing thread), so my intuition is that there are limited places where it's actually problematic that we might hold cs_main longer. Could you point me to those places where it'd be a concern?\r\n\r\n\"Most of our net code is single-threaded, so it's not a problem to hold cs_main longer\" is thinking about this the wrong way round. Instead, it makes more sense to say \"we hold cs_main almost everywhere in net_processing, so our current opportunities for parallelism are limited\". Breaking up cs_main has a couple of very important benefits: firstly, it reduces the coupling between validation and net_processing and enforces a cleaner separation between those components. That's good because it allows better testing of individual components and reduces the cognitive overhead when thinking about changes in either. Secondly it allows the possibility of parallelism between net_processing and validation. That's something that's been discussed and proposed many times before:\r\n\r\n- \"The biggest gain I'm aware of from concurrency is that right now when connecting multiple blocks at a time (due to out of order fetching in IBD) we stop downloading new blocks ... fixing that would be a big gain; so it might be worth prioritizing improvements that would let that happen.\"\r\nhttp://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/bitcoin-core-dev/2018/bitcoin-core-dev.2018-05-03-19.00.log.html#l-256\r\n- \"relaying compact block gettxn during block connection [...] is the one big cheapish win left for block-relay-latency\"\r\nhttp://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/bitcoin-core-dev/2018/bitcoin-core-dev.2018-05-03-19.00.log.html#l-258\r\n- \"Explicitly simplifying the concurrency model hopefully reduces a bit the cognitive burden of future code changes...\"\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12934#issuecomment-383747761\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16323\r\n\r\nImplementing parallelism between validation and net_processing would be useful, but without reducing cs_main scope in net_processing, the gains are limited:\r\n\r\n> It's not going to be really at all useful until we do a ton of locking cleanups in net_processing (it'll let us run ahead to the next message, which almost always requires cs_main, and we'll end up blocking on validation anyway).\"\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12934#issuecomment-385131498\r\n\r\n> It seems to me that there are two things going on here: one is moving application layer code to net_processing data structures and out of net data structures, which seems like an obvious win to me (adding some new p2p features can be tedious because of the current split). The other is redoing the locking, which is less clear to me;\r\n\r\nCurrently, the model is that the per-peer data in CNode is owned by net, with synchronized access managed by mutexes in net. The proposal here is to change that so the data is owned by net_processing, with synchronized access managed by mutexes in net_processing. That's not currently possible because access to CNodeState is managed by a mutex in validation (cs_main). Hence the need to add a structure to net_processing whose access is managed by mutexes in net_processing.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (moving the data to have synchronized access managed by validation) is adding technical debt. Everything moved under cs_main will need to be unwound if we want to get the full benefits of making validation asynchronous.\r\n\r\nMore generally speaking, it's just good practice to have finer grained locks and to hold those locks for the minimum time possible:\r\n\r\n> Hopefully it's obvious that if you have one mutex protecting an entire data structure, not only is there likely to be more contention for the lock, but also the potential for reducing the time that the lock is held is diminished. More of the operation steps will require a lock on the same mutex, so the lock must be held longer. This double whammy of a cost is also a double incentive to move toward finer-grained locking wherever possible.\r\n> \r\n> As this example shows, locking at an appropriate granularity isn't only about the amount of data locked; it's also about how long the lock is held and what operations are performed while the lock is held. _In general, a lock should be held for only the minimum possible time needed to perform the required operations_. [emphasis his] This also means that time-consuming operations such as acquiring another lock (even if you know it won't deadlock) or waiting for I/O to complete shouldn't be done while holding a lock unless absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nAnthony Williams, C++ Concurrency In Action\r\n\r\n> Also, relating to the moving of data structures between net and net_processing, I think it'll be important to understand what you imagine the interface between those two modules to look like.\r\n\r\nI'm not proposing any changes to the interface here (except moving data that is only used in net_processing into net_processing). Once that movement is complete, further improvements to the interface may suggest themselves (and be easier to implement), but for now the goal is just to untangle the data ownership model between the two.\r\n\r\n> I suppose understanding how you expect the locking/synchronization to work would make sense as well, as that might also show how tightly coupled these changes are?\r\n\r\n> (A gist that explains all this at a high level would be very helpful.)\r\n\r\nThis is implemented in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19607. It's a pretty small PR, so should be fairly easy to review. I don't think I can add any clarity in a gist, but if there's anything that's unclear in the code, I'm very happy to expand the code comments so it's clear what's going on. https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/2020-06-cs-main-split builds on that and moves the CNode members into the new Peer structure.",

Instead, it makes more sense to say \"we hold cs_main almost everywhere in net_processing, so our current opportunities for parallelism are limited\".\r\n\r\nMy point was that you're calling this locking issue a blocker; work gets done more quickly when there are fewer blockers, so I was trying to probe whether this is actually so.  This is not the same as suggesting that we not pursue parallelism!  But a question about whether we can pursue parallelism, ahem, in parallel with these other changes, rather than serially.\r\n\r\nFor example, another way to achieve your goals would be to dump everything into CNodeState, and then have a separate PR that unlocks parallelism by moving that which should not be synchronized by cs_main into something protected by its own lock. That's a worse strategy than doing it right the first time, to be sure, but to code reviewers who don't yet know how it's going to work eventually, it's hard to verify that what you're doing is right to begin with.\r\n\r\nFrom reading everything you wrote, it seems like the main motivation behind the locking changes you're proposing is in support of parallelizing validation with net_processing.  Is that correct?  If so, I think it would be helpful to understand what the semantics of such parallelism would look like, in order to understand what locking semantics are useful in support of that concurrency.  Ideas on how to parallelize net processing with validation have indeed been thrown around for years by many different people, but I'm not aware of any design that has been circulated to help us all understand what can be parallelized and, importantly, what cannot or should not be.\r\n\r\nFor example, one question I have is whether your design will allow for parallelizing net_processing with itself -- can we support more than 1 message processing thread?  Are the design considerations for that different than if we just have 1 message processing thread?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if there is a small specific proposal (like asynchronous ProcessNewBlock) that is achievable on top of the specific refactors you're proposing, then that could be a great way to demonstrate why the design you're picking makes sense.  But in the absence of a concrete goal it's very hard for me to say that one design is better than another -- I took a brief look at #19607 and it seems fine to me, but if you moved everything into CNodeState that would seem fine to me as well.  If one of those designs works and the other doesn't for a feature we want, then obviously we should pick the design that works.  But until that point, it seems to me that in the absence of a design document that we all agree on, other contributors may offer up code changes that don't conform to your particular design philosophy, and it will be hard to argue whether one or another is correct/incorrect.\r\n\r\nAnyway I certainly don't mean to throw sand in the gears at all, because moving data structures out of net and into net_processing seems like a clear win, however you do it; I just want to explain why it's hard for me to understand the bigger picture about the path forward and why it should to be done in a particular way that you're proposing.",

While there's currently a 1-1 mapping between\r\nthose ideas right now, separate the two concepts more clearly so that in the\r\nfuture it'll be easier to reason about changes, particularly if we add more\r\nconnection types which do not relay transactions.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review.

          "body": "Compact blocks are used for efficient relay of blocks, either through High Bandwidth or Low Bandwidth mode. See [BIP 152](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki) for full details.\r\n\r\nFor compact block relay to work, the receiver must have a mempool containing transactions which are likely to be included in the block. The receiver uses these transactions to reconstruct the block from the short transaction ids included in the `cmpctblock` message. Compact blocks are therefore only useful for relaying blocks at or near the tip of the block chain. For older blocks, the recipient won't have the transactions in their mempool and so would need to request them using a `getblocktxn` message. In such cases, just requesting the full block is more efficient.\r\n\r\nBIP 152 supports two versions: version 1 (without witnesses) and version 2 (with witnesses). Version 2 is required to reconstruct segwit blocks. Segwit was activated in August 2017, and providing non-witness blocks to peers is no longer useful. Since the witnesses are not included, the peer would not be able to fully validate all the consensus rules on the provided block.\r\n\r\nTherefore, stop supporting version 1 compact blocks. Ignore `sendcmpct` messages with version=1, and don't advertise support by sending `sendcmpct` with version=1. Only send `sendcmpct` to peers with `NODE_WITNESS`. Respond to all requests for compact blocks or blocktxns with witness-serialized blocks and transactions.",

It works as follows:\r\n\r\n- A pre-segwit (i.e. v0.13.0 or older) node is running.\r\n-  Segwit activates. The pre-segwit node remains sync'ed to the tip, but is not enforcing the new segwit rules.\r\n- The user upgrades the node to a segwit-aware version (v0.13.1 or newer).\r\n- On startup, in `AppInitMain()`, `RewindBlockIndex()` is called. This walks the chain backwards from the tip, disconnecting and erasing blocks that from after segwit activation that weren't validated with segwit rules.\r\n- those blocks are then redownloaded (with witness data) and validated with segwit rules.\r\n\r\nThis logic probably isn't required any more since:\r\n\r\n- Segwit activated at height 481824, when the block chain was 130GB and the total number of txs was 250 million. Today, we're at height 667704, the blockchain is over 315GB and the total number of txs is over 600 million. Even if 20% of that added data is witness data (a high estimate), then around 150GB of transactions would need to be rewound to get back to segwit activation height. It'd probably be faster to simply validate from genesis, especially since we won't be validating any scripts before the assumevalid block. It's also unclear whether rewinding 150GB of transactions would even work. It's certainly never been tested.\r\n- Bitcoin Core v0.13 is hardly used any more. https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/software.html shows less than 50 nodes running it. The software was EOL on Aug 1st 2018. It's very unlikely that anyone is running 0.13 and will want to upgrade to 0.22.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `NeedsRedownload()` which merely checks for insufficiently validated segwit blocks and requests that the user restarts the node with `-reindex`. Reindexing the block files upon restart will make the node rebuild chain state and block index from the `blk*.dat` files on disk. The node won't be able to index the blocks with `BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS`, so they will be missing from the chain and be re-downloaded, with witness data.\r\n\r\nRemoving this code allows the following (done in follow-up #21090):\r\n\r\n- removal of tests using `segwitheight=-1` in `p2p_segwit.py`.\r\n- in turn, that allows us to drop support for `-segwitheight=-1`, which is only supported for that test.\r\n- that allows us to always set `NODE_WITNESS` in our local services. The only reason we don't do that is to support `-segwitheight=-1`.\r\n- that in turn allows us to drop all of the `GetLocalServices() & NODE_WITNESS` checks inside `net_processing.cpp`, since our local services would always include `NODE_WITNESS`\r\n\r\n",

It refactors `addr` send functionality into its own function `MaybeSendAddr()` and flattens/simplifies the code. Isolating and simplifying the addr handling code makes subsequent changes (which will move addr data and logic into net processing) easier to review.\r\n\r\nThis is a pure refactor. There are no functional changes.\r\n\r\nFor motivation of the project, see #19398.",

This bundle may _apparently_ introduce usage of `g_chainman` or `::Chain(state|)Active()` globals, but these are resolved later on in the overall PR. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n2. There may be seemingly obvious local references to `ChainstateManager` or other validation objects which are not being used in callers of the current function in question, this is done intentionally to **_keep each commit centered around one function/method_** to ease review and to make the overall change systematic. We don't assume anything about our callers. Rest assured that once we are considering that particular caller in later commits, we will use the obvious local references. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n3. When changing a function/method that has many callers (e.g. `LookupBlockIndex` with 55 callers), it is sometimes easier (and less error-prone) to use a scripted-diff. When doing so, there will be 3 commits in sequence so that every commit compiles like so:\r\n\t1. Add `new_function`, make `old_function` a wrapper of `new_function`, divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the local module only**\r\n\t2. Scripted-diff to divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the rest of the codebase**\r\n\t3. Remove `old_function`",

          "body": "Efficient isolated fuzzing of our message processing code (net processing) would be very valuable. However, to make that deterministic, fast and fuzzer friendly it appears that extensive refactoring is required. There are three main blockers: module separation (net/net processing/validation split), determinism, performance.\r\n\r\nI am gonna use this issue to track and motivate the work that needs to be done. It would be great if we can achieve the same outcome with less refactoring but I don't see how at the moment. Open to suggestions and feedback.\r\n\r\n### Module separation\r\n\r\nOnce we have a clean separation between our net, net processing and validation modules, we can fuzz/test them in isolation to maximize the bug yield (🐛, 🪲, 🪳). By design, most fuzzing engines are not great at finding bugs when the scope of the targets is too large (e.g. fuzzing net, net processing and validation all at once).\r\n\r\n* net / net processing split\r\n  * Move application layer data from net to net processing ([#19398](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19398))\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26621\r\n  * Define a clean interface between net processing <-> net \r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25268\r\n      - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25500\r\n      - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25572\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25515\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27407\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27257\r\n* net processing / validation split (lots of overlap with kernel)\r\n  * Reduce `cs_main` usage in net processing\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26151\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26140\r\n    - [ ] Kill CNodeState\r\n  * Define a clean interface between net processing <-> validation\r\n\r\n### Determinism\r\n\r\nNon-deterministic fuzz targets are less efficient at finding bugs and debugging non-reproducible bugs is annoying/costly.\r\n\r\n* All required components should be newly setup for each target execution\r\n  * Can be done currently using our testing setup suite but that's waaaay too slow for fuzzing.\r\n* Avoid  `GetRand()` (mock it?)\r\n* Avoid globals (are there any globals left in net processing?)\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nFuzzing is a search, the faster the search - the better.\r\n\r\n* LevelDB (is in memory but still slow?)\r\n  * Probably solved by mocking out validation?\r\n* PeerManager construction is expensive because it requires multi megabyte allocations each time (mostly due to large bloom filters)\r\n* Disk usage\r\n  * Block storage\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125\r\n    - [ ] Create a mock of BlockManager for in memory block storage?\r\n  * BanMan (banlist is written to disk)\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n* Decouple net processing from ArgsMan (args setup is slow)\r\n  * Allows to fuzz the peerman options without depending on the global args man \r\n  - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27499\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you think there are PRs that aren't listed here but should be.\r\n",

Ensured that all members always initialized correctly in proper order if LLMQContext exists.\r\n\r\nBlockAssembler, CChainState use too many agruments and they are making wrong assumption that members of LLMQContext can be constructed and used independently, but that's not true. Instead, let's pass LLMQContext whenever possible.\r\n\r\n## Issue being fixed or feature implemented\r\nhttps://github.com/dashpay/dash-issues/issues/52\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nRun unit/functional test and introduce no breaking changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [x] I have assigned this pull request to a milestone",
