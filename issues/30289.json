This duplicates some work but is significantly simpler in implementation.\r\n* No ancestor-set based presplitting inside the search is performed; instead, the `best` value is initialized with the best topologically valid set known to the LIMO algorithm before search starts: the better one out of the highest-feerate remaining ancestor set, and the highest-feerate prefix of remaining transactions in `old_linearization`.\r\n* Work items are represented using an included set *inc* and an undefined set *und*, rather than included and excluded.\r\n* Potential sets *pot* are not computed for work items with empty *inc*.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, the only missing optimization from that post is bottleneck analysis; my thinking is that it only really helps with clusters that are already relatively cheap to linearize (doing so would need to be done at a higher level, not inside the search algorithm).\r\n",

It is currently not hooked up to anything.\r\n\r\nUltimately, what this PR adds is a function `Linearize` which operates on instances of `DepGraph` (instances of which represent pre-processed transaction clusters) to produce and/or improve linearizations for that cluster.\r\n\r\nTo provide assurance, the code heavily relies on fuzz tests. A novel approach is used here, where the fuzz input is parsed using the serialization.h framework rather than `FuzzedDataProvider`, with a custom serializer/deserializer for `DepGraph` objects. By including serialization, it's possible to ascertain that the format can represent every relevant cluster, as well as potentially permitting the construction of ad-hoc fuzz inputs from clusters (not included in this PR, but used during development).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe `Linearize(depgraph, iteration_limit, rng_seed, old_linearization)` function is an implementation of the (single) [LIMO](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/limo-combining-the-best-parts-of-linearization-search-and-merging/825) algorithm, with the $S$ in every iteration found as the best out of (a) the best remaining ancestor set and (b) randomized computationally-bounded search. It incrementally builds up a linearization by finding good topologically-valid subsets to move to the front, in such a way that the resulting linearization has a diagram that is at least as good as the `old_linearization` passed in (if any).\r\n* Despite using both best ancestor set and search, this is not Double LIMO, as no intersections between these are involved; just the best of the two.\r\n* The `iteration_limit` and `rng_seed` only control the (b) randomized search. Even with 0 iterations, the result will be as good as the old linearization, and the included sets at every point will have a feerate at least as high as the best remaining ancestor set at that point.\r\n\r\nThe search algorithm used in the (b) step is very basic. See #30286 for optimizations to make it more efficient.",
