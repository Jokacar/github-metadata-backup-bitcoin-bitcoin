    "body": "This is intended to be a safer way for functions to accept only a subset of sigversion values.\r\n\r\nIt's intended to solve the uninitialized value warning seen here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25972#issuecomment-1246632859\r\n\r\nNow that all possible values in the `enum class` are tested, there's no need for a default case and thus the compiler should be able to deduce that there's no way for this value to be used uninitialized.\r\n\r\nSadly it's not possible to do any type of inheritance with an `enum class`, so instead it's faked by using `std::underlying_type_t<SigVersion>`, which should ensure that it's in sync with `SigVersion` even if it changes in the future.\r\n\r\nImo this is safe enough that there's no need for a default case as suggested here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25972#issuecomment-1248193244 , but that's up for discussion here.\r\n\r\nThe second commit is simply a cleanup that removes the need to pass a sigversion to EvalChecksigTapscript because it's only intended to ever be used with... tapscript.",

          "body": "The current taproot signing code will end up creating transactions which do not meet the feerate target. This is primarily seen when spending a taproot output with the script path. In this scenario, because the public key is known, the dummy signer would incorrectly choose to create a dummy signed transaction that used the key path spend when the actual transaction would use script path. This results in a transaction that has a significantly lower fee rate because script path spends are much larger than key path spends. This is fixed by choosing the witness with the largest stack size rather than the smallest when doing size estimation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this change can result in massively overestimating the transaction fees which is undesirable. More discussion is needed to find a good solution to avoiding that problem.\r\n\r\nThere is an additional issue in the PSBT workflow where the sighash type would be appended during finalizing, but not during size estimation. That results in a transaction that is slightly larger than estimated so there is a lower feerate. This is resolved by having the DUMMY_MAXIMUM_SIGNATURE_CREATOR include the sighash type so that when funding with a watchonly wallet, we will estimate enough fee for the largest possible signature (as we do for ECDSA with high R).\r\n\r\nTests are updated to catch these case. `wallet_taproot.py` will now use a set feerate and check if the result meets that feerate.",

          "title": "Simplify BaseSignatureChecker virtual functions and GenericTransactionSignatureChecker constructors",
          "body": "`BaseSignatureChecker` has virtual functions which are overridden by its child classes. These virtual functions have a default implementation. However because of the default implementation, bugs can be introduced by failing to implement one of them (e.g. #21151). To avoid this, those functions are made into pure virtual functions so that child classes must implement those functions. There are a few places where a `BaseSignatureChecker` was being created; these instances have been replaced with the `DUMMY_CHECKER`.\r\n\r\n`GenericTransactionSignatureChecker` has two constructors, one which takes a `PrecomputedTransactionData` and one which does not. It can be difficult to understand which one to use, and whether a particular `GenericTransactionSignatureChecker` has a `PrecomputedTransactionData`. This has lead to some bugs as well (e.g. #22784). Looking through the codebase, the only place where `PrecomputedTransactionData` does not need to be provided is in the unit tests. As such, this PR changes `GenericTransactionSignatureChecker` to have only one constructor which requires `PrecomputedTransactionData` to be provided. This has a side effect of requiring the same for `MutableTransactionSignatureCreator`, which also had two constructors, and the one that did not require `PrecomputedTransactionData` was only used in tests.",
