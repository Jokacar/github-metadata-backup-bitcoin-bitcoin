(If there is, then that is a bug in Bitcoin Core, which should be fixed)\r\n\r\n> https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/\r\n\r\nThis example has many issues:\r\n\r\n* It is not machine readable\r\n* It does not indicate the version of Bitcoin Core that is documented\r\n* It is wrong and outdated. For example https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/getrawtransaction.html#argument-2-verbose is wrong. The type should be `int`, not a `bool`. Also it is missing verbose=3.\r\n* It has all the problems that I mentioned in the original post.\r\n\r\n>  https://wbnns.github.io/bitcoin-dev-docs/reference/rpc/index.html\r\n\r\nThis is the same as above, just rendered differently.\r\n\r\n>  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md\r\n\r\nI am aware of the file, because I initially wrote it. It describes the concept of the interface, but it is not a specification.\r\n\r\n> https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_%28JSON-RPC%29\r\n\r\nThis is a wiki page that lists some manually maintained software projects, so all of them have the issues I mentioned in the original post. I don't have the time right now to list all the bugs they have, but if you spend enough time you will find that they are either not a specification, or that they are unmaintained for years, or that they have implementation errors.\r\n\r\nEdit: If there is a single software project out there, which currently correctly and fully implements the RPC API in a type-safe manner, it would be interesting to see how they approached it. But I doubt there is one?",
