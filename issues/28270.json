    "title": "Any JavaScript functional test for this repo?",
    "body": "### Motivation\n\nHi,\r\nI am learning Bitcoin using this repo, and I have some experience with JavaScript, but my level with Python is very limited.  I want to run some tests using JavaScript, but I found that all the functional tests are in Python.  I want to know if it is possible to have the same functional tests in JavaScript.\r\nOr give me some ideas on how can I do this with JavaScript?\r\nFor example for test_node.py and test_framework.py; if I want to use JavaScript with Bitcoin-core npm package, can I do the same as test_node.py & test_framework.py using JavaScript.  I can rewrite all the Python code in JavaScript with help of AI.  But give me some ideas on how to setup the environment: like setup 2 bitcoin core nodes (Alice & Bob) in a docker image with regest mode, so later I can use JavaScript to mine some BTCs in Alice node and send half of the mined BTCs to Bob.  In short, how to setup environment and run some tests in JavaScript like what the test_node.py & test_framework.py (under functional/test_frawmwork/ folder) can do?\n\n### Possible solution\n\nNeed some advice\n\n### Useful Skills\n\nJavaScript\n\n### Guidance for new contributors\n\nWant to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",

      "body": "This would not be possible without a large refactor. The Bitcoin-core npm package is very good for communicating with the bitcoind server to run RPC commands, the internal testing suite of python code spins up various instances of bitcoind with different flags and executes commands against those instances. You would have to replicate this in JS. As such this is more of a discussion topic and not an issue.\r\n\r\nAll in all the npm Bitcoin core package would not  be a good candidate as a wrapper for test_runner.py  \r\n\r\nThis issue should be closed.",
