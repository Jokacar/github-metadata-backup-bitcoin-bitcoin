    "title": "Bitcoin Core \"not opened\" after software update to macOS  Sequoia 15.0.1 (24A348)",
    "body": "Hello, \r\nI have a macbook pro 2021 (1 TB) and this has been my primary device to store my bitcoins. I had downloaded bitcoin core wallet on this mac about 2-3 years ago ( I don't exactly remember when). It was working fine all this while but after this new mac update to Sequoia 15.0.1, I am unable to see the bitcoin core wallet on my mac. I can't see it on the \"applications\" or in the \"finder\" or in the \"launchpad\" of my mac. \r\n\r\nI can see that the storage is still occupied in my mac worth about 720 GB and I don't have any other applications on this mac so it is somewhere on my mac. \r\n\r\nI contacted Apple Support and they told me to make a backup of my mac. They tried everything on their end and they couldn't find why the application is not showing. They told me that \"it might not be compatible with the new macOS, so contact the application developer\". \r\n\r\nNow since there is no \"About us\" on the bitcoin core page or anywhere, my option is to ask for help over here. Please if somebody can look into this and help me out. I had all of my life savings in this application. \r\n\r\nUpdate: It gives me an error called \"bitcoin core: not opened\" .",
