    "body": "Opening this for discussion.\r\n\r\nCurrently it's possible in our RBF rules to evict a transaction with higher mining score from our mempool, in favor of a transaction with a higher total fee but lower feerate.  This patch would fix this incentive incompatibility, by requiring that any new transaction have a mining score (as defined by the minimum of its feerate and its feerate including ancestors) to be greater than the individual feerates of all transactions that would be evicted.\r\n\r\nBecause this new feerate criteria includes the ancestors of a new transaction in the score, we are able to eliminate the prohibition against including new unconfirmed parents in a replacement transaction, a slight relaxation of the prior rules.",

If you look at the test I've added, the feerate needed in order to get the new transaction into the mempool is extremely high, illustrating the point that fixing incentive compatibility appears to make the pinning problem much, much worse.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we are interested in incentive compatibility of our replacement rules, I believe this is the most straightforward set of rules that we could adopt which would ensure that we never evict something that has a better mining score than a new incoming transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "This is built on top of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933 - please review that first.\r\nSee #27463 for overall project tracking.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 2 projects: v3 policy and package RBF. Mailing list posts: [package RBF 1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019464.html) and [V3 + package RBF 2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html). It stems from a long discussion about RBF pinning, across a [mailing list thread](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html) and [gist](https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff).\r\n\r\nV3 Policy: A simple set of additional policy rules applied to transactions with their `nVersion` field set to 3. These rules are designed to be anti-DoS (effectively limits cluster size without specifically adding cluster-based logic to the mempool) and enable the node to efficiently assess incentive compatibility. If adopted by many nodes in the network, V3 mitigates various RBF pinning attacks. See doc/policy/version3_transactions.md for the exact rules and rationale, and [these review club notes](bitcoincore.reviews/25038) for more background and discussion.\r\n\r\nPackage RBF: In addition to allowing a child to pay for its parents within the package, also allow the child to pay for replacing the parent's conflicts. For example, this allows LN users to replace commitment transactions existing in the mempool, simply by broadcasting their respective commitment transactions with a high-fee child. The commitment transactions can be signed with 0 fees, which means no overpaying.",

      "body": "Would it be better to make this change as part of a rethink for package rbf?\r\n\r\n> Currently it's possible in our RBF rules to evict a transaction with higher mining score from our mempool, in favor of a transaction with a higher total fee but lower feerate.\r\n\r\nIn particular, doesn't this block some cases where you could currently replace a pair of txs [A,B] \r\nwith [C,D]  (A and C conflicting; B spending A, and D spending C) where D has the highest mining score? That is, without package relay, you have to consider whether to evict both of A,B while only considering C, which will often lead you to make a suboptimal choice. With package relay, you can wait and consider C's inclusion only when you also have D available, and use that extra information to make a better decision...\r\n\r\nGetting the incentive compatible answer here seems hard even with package relay (if you receive C on its own first, you should reject it; but if you add its txid to a hard reject filter and forget it, then when D arrives you'll reject it for having a rejected parent, rather than recalculating the fee and seeing that it is worth replacing). Incentive compatibility may also result in the mempool repeatedly swapping between A and C, eg if they were pre-signed transactions being CPFPed by a series of B1/D1/B2/D2/.. CPFP txs taking a scorched earth approach of incrementally burning the potential profits to fees, though that's presumably solved by requiring Bn/Dn to pay an incremental relay fee for the package, not just itself.\r\n\r\nOther than that, this seems reasonable to me.\r\n\r\n> Based on discussions, I think the issue is that a new unconfirmed input could be included that actually would have been mined anyways, thus giving the replacement child a higher estimated miner score than it otherwise should have. Raising the \"min\" in the function between the ancestor and individual score.\r\n\r\nCan you give a concrete example of this? As far as I can see that case only works when the new conflict C replacing A+B, spends some new unconfirmed tx Y, and \"Y + X + C\" has a lower fee rate than \"Y + X + A + B\". But we compare C's feerate with A and B's raw feerate, and only accept the replacement if that's larger; and having Y as a parent can only serve to reduce C's feerate from raw? So having mined Y and X, it seems to me that mining C is always superior to A or A+B, except in the edge case where you've run out of block space.",

If so, what are they?\r\n\r\n * Is it reasonable to enforce BIP 125's rbf rules on all transactions, if those rules themselves are not always incentive compatible?\r\n\r\n * If someone were to propose a command line option that breaks v3 transaction relay in the future, is there a logical basis for opposing that which is consistent with moving towards fullrbf now?\r\n",

Sorry if the test is a little ugly, but if you inspect you'll see that there are three initial unrelated transactions in the mempool:\r\ntxA - feerate 961 sat/vbyte\r\ntxP1 - feerate 9.6 sat/vbyte\r\ntxP2 - feerate 9615 sat/vbyte\r\n\r\nThen we construct transaction A' that conflicts with A but spends P1 and P2.  The feerate of A' by itself is 1073 sat/vbyte, but the feerate of (A', P1) is 715 sat/vbyte. So assuming blocks are full with other similarly good transactions, a miner would rather include P2 + A in a block than include P2 + P1 + A'.",

      "body": "> @instagibbs I pushed up a test that I believe shows the insufficiency of the logic. Sorry if the test is a little ugly, but if you inspect you'll see that there are three initial unrelated transactions in the mempool: txA - feerate 961 sat/vbyte txP1 - feerate 9.6 sat/vbyte txP2 - feerate 9615 sat/vbyte\r\n> \r\n> Then we construct transaction A' that conflicts with A but spends P1 and P2. The feerate of A' by itself is 1073 sat/vbyte, but the feerate of (A', P1) is 715 sat/vbyte. So assuming blocks are full with other similarly good transactions, a miner would rather include P2 + A in a block than include P2 + P1 + A'.\r\n\r\nI think with rounder numbers this looks like:\r\n\r\n * P2 1000vb, 10Msat (10,000sat/vb)\r\n * A 1000vb, 1Msat (1,000sat/vb)\r\n * B 1000vb, 1.1Msat (1,100sat/vb)  (conflicts with A, spends P1 and P2)\r\n * C 1000vb, 600ksat (600sat/vb\r\n * P1 1000vb, 10ksat (10sat/vb)\r\n\r\nWith A in the mempool, your block ordering would be [P2, A, C, P1]. With B in the mempool, your block ordering would be [P2, C, P1, B]. That has the usual complexities with limited block sizes -- if we were at the last 2000vb or 3000vb in the block, we'd prefer to have A; but if we had 4000vb in the block (and no other txs), we'd prefer B.\r\n\r\nEven if we fixed that, and only counted P1 towards B's score and thus chose to keep A, we could just go a layer down due to the possibility of another tx cpfp'ing P1: if we added a tx,\r\n\r\n * D 1000vb, 100Msat (100,000 sat/vb) (spends P1, doesn't conflict with anything)\r\n\r\nthen our block ordering would be [P1, D, P2, A, C] or [P1, D, P2, B, C] and we would always prefer to have B in our mempool, no matter how much space we had left in the block. And then if a tx E came in, that conflicts with D, but doesn't spend P1, we'd go back to preferring A rather than B.\r\n\r\nThat is to say: there are at least two \"non-local\" issues that affect whether we prefer A or B: how close A or B would be to the end of the block, and whether other higher-scoring transactions are already cpfp'ing in-mempool parents.\r\n\r\nI think maybe what we're trying to achieve is something more simple, like \"relay tx replacements if and only if they're obviously sensible\", ie:\r\n\r\n * if the signers of a tx are willing to spend more in fees (rules 3/4) on a replacement tx\r\n * and we're sure the replacement tx is more attractive to miners than the original (rules 2/5/6)\r\n * then include it in our mempool and relay it onwards\r\n\r\nIf we can't be sure which of A/B is best because it could change depending on unrelated txs in the mempool, then we just don't do anything, though of course the signers could always contact miners directly. We'll still get this wrong at edge cases due to the block limit (a larger replacement with more fees might not fit in a block when the smaller original would, and despite having lower fees, the next best alternative might be even lower than that), but the only way to avoid that would be to require the tx always be smaller, which seems unreasonably limiting.\r\n\r\nIn light of that, rather than just doing away with rule 2, maybe examining it explicitly might be better? If you're replacing A with B, and A's in-mempool parents are X,Y and B's are X,Z; then maybe you want to compare the minimum score of (B, B+Z.ancestor_score) compared to the minimum score of (A, A+Y.ancestor_score)? For multiple parents, I think you'd want to sort them by their ancestors scores (smallest to largest), and continue until your accumulated score is lower than next parent's ancestor score. That will have some false negatives still, but I think it would avoid false positives (allowing replacements that are less appealing to miners) and might not be too complicated?",

The symmetric comparison seems easier to reason about, in that we can switch the sides around from an ordering perspective, and you get identical results, i.e. not seeming to introduce pinning vector. If deemed \"incentive compatible\", it seems tighter than the `CheckMinerScores` check in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038/files#diff-fa5cb2d84034ff72cdb9d479b17cf8c744a9bf3fc932b3a77c1a017edd767dfaR185 which suffers from an order-dependent pinning vector when adding new unconfirmed inputs.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> I think maybe what we're trying to achieve is something more simple, like \"relay tx replacements if and only if they're obviously sensible\r\n\r\nYes this is how I'm thinking about it as well.\r\n\r\n> In light of that, rather than just doing away with rule 2, maybe examining it explicitly might be better? If you're replacing A with B, and A's in-mempool parents are X,Y and B's are X,Z; then maybe you want to compare the minimum score of (B, B+Z.ancestor_score) compared to the minimum score of (A, A+Y.ancestor_score)?\r\n\r\n@ajtowns I don't think this works, because if Y has other, higher feerate children besides A, then (A+Y).ancestor_score can understate the miner's incentive to include (Y, A) in a block -- Y might already be scheduled for inclusion due to some unrelated descendant.  An easy heuristic to avoid that issue is to just look at A's individual feerate (but that will risk overstating A's desirability -- which is ok if our goal is to merely ensure that any replacements that do happen are sensible, and not to ensure that all replacements that \"should\" happen are able to take place, but this would make pinning much worse of a problem).\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it's beneficial to avoid looking at all the ancestors of the transactions being removed, because that could be a large number of ancestors to traverse. \r\n\r\n> For multiple parents, I think you'd want to sort them by their ancestors scores (smallest to largest), and continue until your accumulated score is lower than next parent's ancestor score. That will have some false negatives still, but I think it would avoid false positives (allowing replacements that are less appealing to miners) and might not be too complicated?\r\n\r\nI think this might work (when applied to the replacement transaction only) -- will try this approach.  I think the easiest way to do this would be to ignore that the topology of the ancestors may imply that this is more of a \"worst case\" analysis than is always warranted, but if we're only worried about avoiding incentive incompatible replacements, then I think this might suffice.",

          "body": "This PR is a reattempt of #19645, which has been abandoned.\r\n\r\nCurrently, an existing mempool transaction can't be replaced by a transaction that's identical except for its witness (same txid, different wtxid); the request is rejected as a duplicate. This PR changes this behavior such that the mempool will replace the existing transaction if the new transaction has a smaller witness by at least 5% (an anti-Dos measure). The replacement transaction can't increase the fee (since its inputs and outputs cannot change), but it necessarily has a higher fee _rate_ than the existing transaction, since its overall size is lower. Miners should always prefer the replacement transaction.\r\n\r\nAn important difference between what this PR implements and the existing RBF (replace-by-fee, BIP125) is that the replacement can occur even if the original transaction is not marked as replaceable. This is because the replacement transaction will pay the same outputs as the transaction being replaced (identical txids ensures this), so the recipients of the existing transaction have no reason to fear not being paid by the replacement transaction. Unlike RBF, all of the existing transaction's descendants, if any, remain in the mempool.\r\n\r\nInitially, we'll limit this to single transactions (not packages); this can be reconsidered later.",

To prevent them, I think you need a different goal, eg \"relay tx replacements in all circumstances, picking a consistent winner even when it's not obvious that's necessarily sensible\". That is, there's a big difference between designing something that just tries to maximise the \"obvious\" cases and one that prevents attackers from being able to find and take advantage of a \"non-obvious\" case.",

If you go from (A+C) to (A+B+C2) with (A+B+C2) having to have a greater feerate than C alone did, that ends up pretty crazy -- if A was 10kvb and C was 100vb, and C's paying most of the fees, then C's feerate will be 100x A+C's, and A+B+C2's feerate is greater still, so you're forced to do a 100x fee bump. Still clearly safe, and no worse than saying \"you can't add an input ever\", but maybe not worth the effort of coding :(\r\n",

Would be curious if @0xB10C has some data on use cases impacted.\r\n\r\nI would expect that the heuristic I propose here would certainly make pinning worse if people wanted to take advantage of this.  For instance, imagine two conflicting transactions A, A'.  A is in the mempool and has two children, B and C.\r\n\r\nSuppose B is large -- 49kvb, and has very low feerate (could be 0 feerate, once package relay is in place).  C is relatively small, say 100vb[1], but pays a very large feerate, say 49.1k sats.  Then under the policy I've proposed here, someone wanting to get A' to replace A would not only need to pay more than 49.1k sats more than whatever fee A has on it, the feerate would also need to be at least 491sat/vbyte, even though B+C together only pay 1 sat/vbyte.\r\n\r\nUnder the old rules, the person creating transaction A' may have had some incentive to just make their transaction bigger, so that the increased total fee that needs to be paid can be put to use by at least consolidating UTXOs, which otherwise would cost something on their own (this would be reasonable to do if the feerate on the replacement transaction wouldn't need to be very large compared with the direct conflicts).  But with the new rule, doing that would be disastrous as a bigger transaction would also be at a much higher feerate than before.\r\n\r\n[1] I can't remember right now what the smallest reasonable transaction size I should include here, so replace this number with whatever is achievable (I assume 100 is pretty close to the size of a 1-in, 1-out segwit transaction nowadays).",

      "body": "I've searched through my RBF data specifically for replacements with a negative feerate deltas. I've looked at data from 2022-02-11 to 2022-10-31 captured with a Bitcoin Core node with a [patched ZMQ interface](https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin-zmq-mempool-chain-events/blob/v23.0-zmce/PATCH.md) running with default parameters for mempool and policy. During this period my node has seen 1.65M transactions being replaced in 363k RBF-sequences (multiple replacements related by conflicting inputs). Out of these RBF-sequences, only 223 included a replacement where the replaced-transactions feerate was higher than the replacement-transactions feerate (i.e. negative feerate delta).\r\n\r\nInitially, I thought there might be a single entity with a clear pattern doing these negative feerate delta replacements on purpose. However, by categorizing by transaction versions and transaction locktime (set or unset) showed various combinations of transactions being replaced. Additionally, the transactions are a mix of simple payment transactions (few inputs, few outputs), consolidation transactions (high input to output ratio), and _payout_ transactions (high output to input ratio). I don't think they come from the same source given the different wallet fingerprints. My thesis is, that **most of these are probably cases where unconfirmed outputs are spent by a different party and the original sender (maybe unaware of the child transactions) replaces and \"cancels\" them**.\r\n\r\nGiven that there's no real pattern, I've picked out some examples.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19157360/201697803-5962223a-c942-49a3-bd31-dff7f26a07e3.png)\r\n\r\nExample 1: This graph shows the RBF-sequence of a transaction confirming as [03a86cf6..](https://blockstream.info/tx/03a86cf631ce9e57ba2d43e670653d9e4b0722cfb6a1ed8cd128aff490557279)(tx2 here). First, tx0 (version=2, inputs=4, outputs=2, likely a payment, locktime set) was broadcast with a feerate of 2.92 sat/vByte. About 25 min later tx1 (version=**1**, inputs/outputs=2, likely also a payment, locktime unset) was broadcast at 15.9 sat/vByte spending an unconfirmed UTXO of tx0. Half an hour later, tx2 (version=2, inputs=4, outputs=2, likely a payment, locktime set) was broadcast at 12.37 sat/vByte which replaced both tx0 and tx1. The inputs and output scripts of tx0 and tx2 are equal, the only thing that changed was the fee: this is a simple fee bump. However, the outputs of tx1 are not contained in tx2. This transaction is effectively removed from the network before it could confirm (i.e cancelled). The feerate delta between tx1 and tx2 is negative. This is possible because we don't check the feerate of children in our RBF rule 6 checks. With the proposed change in this PR, tx2 would have had to pay more than tx1's feerate of 15.9 sat/vByte. \r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19157360/201697920-b1f958d1-c3dd-4a3b-8dda-7840439639ba.png)\r\n\r\nExample 2: This example shows a fee bump from 1 sat/vByte to 5 sat/vByte of a consolidation (tx0 and [tx3](https://blockstream.info/tx/bf46e55fc81fb2ea34ea4f37f9a404a1d117b0bf2c933d27a59fae348fc71b0a); circle size grows with tx vsize). In between, tx1 as child of tx0 and tx2 as child of tx1 were broadcast with a higher feerate. Here, the fingerprints of tx1 and tx2 are the same as tx0 and tx2 so the sender of these might be the same (also you usually consolidate to your own wallet). We can't tell if tx1 and tx2 were canceled on purpose (double spent attempt?) or if that wasn't what the party expected to do by replacing tx0. Also, interesting to note is that tx1 has a locktime lower than tx0. This could mean that this transaction came from a Bitcoin Core or an Electrum wallet and it just happened to hit the 10% chance of setting the locktime to `currentHeight - rand(1, 100)` ([Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/48174c0f287b19931ca110670610bd03a03eb914/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L725-L731), [Electrum](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/b357391c4806acbc3d34a907b8f414601276b5fe/electrum/wallet.py#L222-L225)). A few potential learnings (~will create issues for this in Bitcoin Core and Electrum~):\r\n- ~Warn users if doing a fee-bump would cancel a child transaction.~ Bitcoin Core `bumpfee` RPC docs mention \"The command will fail if the wallet or mempool contains a transaction that spends one of T's outputs.\".\r\n- Don't set the locktime to `currentHeight - rand(1, 100)` when replacing a transaction. (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26526, https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/8073)\r\n- Don't set the locktime to `currentHeight - rand(1, 100)` when we are spending from unconfirmed transactions with a locktime set. The \"could be a pre-signed transaction\" argument doesn't work here as the parent has a higher locktime than the child indicating that the child was constructed before the parent. (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26527, https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/8073)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19157360/201698034-aa354212-37f1-4942-a8d0-4268aa975031.png)\r\n\r\nExample 3: This is an example where tx1 could have somewhat cheaply pinned the consolidation transaction tx0. With the proposed change, the fee-bump [tx2](https://blockstream.info/tx/a3290913b632f24688758fc70ca7b3c638664c8f1ad22c59eaa52b9650fb8272) would have needed to pay more than 225 sat/vByte. However, as is a consolidation and the transactions share a fingerprint, these transactions might be from the same party. Not necessarily a malicious pin, but maybe one that would have happened on accident.\r\n\r\nA few complexer examples with less commentary:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19157360/201698189-baad2acc-8139-4210-b7bd-cde6d30310ea.png)\r\nExample 4: Consolidation and payout transaction where (probably) multiple parties already spent their unconfirmed UTXOs before tx0 was replaced. [tx6](https://blockstream.info/tx/39dfa317f36fa47f96d3af717a96e88ca509d175c9332e042a7200dc03b851ec)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19157360/201699269-1d449280-e7c0-4003-8c2d-83cf63864206.png)\r\nExample 5: [tx4](https://blockstream.info/tx/ce10b618ec9cdce8ad9814d84655658a62ac0834d3e4221c69c77d5525a711d5)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19157360/201779475-eb6e7acc-0d04-4a4d-8294-9088a77d1653.png)\r\nExample 6: [tx8](https://blockstream.info/tx/85e81777a512ce01b746ef5ff719dfeefba419d8893ec7ca2946e531e44e0747)\r\n\r\nI don't have a strong opinion on this change yet. I think it's a trade-off between (accidental and malicious) pinning and incentive compatibility. Doesn't seems like implementing this change would impact too many current RBF sequences (223 out of 363k) based on the data from this year. Happy to take another look to answer follow-up questions.

      "body": "In my view the goals for adding a \"miner score\" rule are: Primarily, prevent using RBF to \"knock down\" a transaction's mining priority, either intentionally by an attacker or unintentionally by a wallet not accurately considering unconfirmed inputs' fees. Most notably, currently attackers can delay an ACP tx's confirmation by replacing it with something that spends from a large, low feerate ancestor. Also, it allows removing the \"no new unconfirmed inputs\" rule with more confidence it won't cause problems, thus allowing users to use new unconfirmed inputs to fund their RBFs.\r\n\r\nI'll note that, in the V3 world, min(ancestor feerate, feerate) == the miner score, since there can't be anything else bumping anybody. If we have a V3 replacing a V3, this should work fine. In the non-V3 world, min(ancestor feerate, feerate) can underestimate. Maybe applying this check when all directly-conflicting transactions are V3 makes sense? That achieves the first goal since the replacement (even if non-V3) must have a higher miner score. This would save ACP users if they switch to V3?\r\n\r\nAny underestimation of to-be-replaced mempool transactions' miner scores is a pinning attack, so I'm not completely convinced it's a good idea to use this particular heuristic as a \"miner score\" check on every RBF. For an accurate \"miner score,\" I think the best way is to run the block template algorithm. I implemented this in #26152, which runs the algo on a transaction cluster rather than the whole mempool, but I'm still not sure if the computational complexity is appropriate for use in mempool validation.",

This could result in\ntransactions that would be mined in the next block from being evicted from the\nmempool in favor of transactions which may not be mined for a long time.\nEliminate this behavior to ensure all replacements are incentive compatible.\n\nAt the same time, we also eliminate the restriction against including new\nunconfirmed inputs in a replacement transaction, because we now consider the\nancestor feerate of the new transaction and compare that with the feerates of\nthe transactions being evicted.",

      "body": "I updated this PR with @ajtowns' suggestion:\r\n\r\n> For multiple parents, I think you'd want to sort them by their ancestors scores (smallest to largest), and continue until your accumulated score is lower than next parent's ancestor score.\r\n\r\nI think this is very conservative, but I believe now it should be impossible for non-incentive-compatible replacements to take place.\r\n\r\n>  In the non-V3 world, min(ancestor feerate, feerate) can underestimate. \r\n\r\nThis can both underestimate and overestimate, essentially for the reason that the earlier draft I had of this PR was broken. If a transaction has an ancestor that, say, depends on nothing else and has a very high feerate, then the minimum of ancestor feerate and feerate might just be the feerate of the transaction itself. However, the parent transaction with a higher feerate can be selected first, and then the true mining score of the transaction will be the minimum of its feerate and that with some other parents, which might be lower than the transactions own feerate.  So this shows that we might overestimate a transaction's mining score with this calculation.\r\n\r\n> Any underestimation of to-be-replaced mempool transactions' miner scores is a pinning attack, so I'm not completely convinced it's a good idea to use this particular heuristic as a \"miner score\" check on every RBF. For an accurate \"miner score,\" I think the best way is to run the block template algorithm. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand the first part of this sentence: I think that underestimating the replacement transaction's score might create a pinning attack, and overestimating the score of the to-be-replaced transactions can also create a pinning attack.  And I think this PR in its current form does both.\r\n\r\nI am also not convinced what I've done here is a good idea, and I think comparing this approach to some kind of transaction selection algorithm that operates on a relevant transaction subgraph is worth thinking about.  Some issues to consider:\r\n- How important is it that the RBF replacement rules be understandable to wallets? I think it's fair to say that most wallets aren't able to inspect the mempool anyway, so the BIP 125 rules already aren't something most wallets use to calculate needed fees.  Instead I think the approach I've heard from the lightning community, of firing off transactions and bumping them if they haven't confirmed in a while, seems much more doable. And in that world, having an opaque calculator that governs when a transaction's feerate is high enough to warrant replacement may be good enough?\r\n- How important is it that we accept replacement transactions as soon as they are \"better\" to mine, rather than be conservative and impose higher fee requirements (as this PR would do)?  In a world where v3 transactions can opt out of pinning, is it ok for non-v3 transactions to face worse pinning behaviors? (In that vein, does anyone even worry about pinning anymore now that v3 is being proposed to solve this problem?)\r\n- On the flip side, is there a risk that if we make pinning worse for non-v3 transactions, that we'll drive use towards v3 transactions, and some of those use cases might not be incentive compatible when applied to the rules that govern v3?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> How important is it that the RBF replacement rules be understandable to wallets? ...  And in that world, having an opaque calculator that governs when a transaction's feerate is high enough to warrant replacement may be good enough?\r\n\r\nThat's how I understand it. Idealized functionality is that there is a \"going feerate\" and that the proposed transaction package should be able to get in at that rate, or close to it. Wallets don't know the going rate since it's actually a stochastic variable, so as long as we're approximating this behavior it is likely fine.\r\n\r\n> (In that vein, does anyone even worry about pinning anymore now that v3 is being proposed to solve this problem?)\r\n\r\nLong term, probably not much, but the transition period of currently deployed systems will likely be years even if things were merged today.\r\n\r\n> On the flip side, is there a risk that if we make pinning worse for non-v3 transactions, that we'll drive use towards v3 transactions, and some of those use cases might not be incentive compatible when applied to the rules that govern v3?\r\n\r\nThe risk here is that we make V2 txn topology support so bad that people hand-roll their own policies or directly connect to miners; I think focusing on V3 in that context is nearly orthogonal. i.e. if we merged a V2 tightening that was overly broad, and did not move forward with an alternative policy, this risk already exists.\r\n\r\nFrom a sheer numeric perspective, it looks like this PR's change(at least before latest modification) doesn't effect much: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26451#issuecomment-1313934927 Is that a strike for the change or against it, I don't know!\r\n",

The arguments for this include miner incentive compatibility, maximization of fees per block through next-block priority-competition, utility for merchants and consumers, intelligent double-spend risk mitigation, protection of the user space, and optimization of Bitcoin adoption, utility, and activity.\r\n\r\nI apologize for not yet having a reference link with full details of all of my arguments, but I am happy to interact with commenters on any arguments for a full RBF agenda here. I can also alleviate any concerns with current zero-conf acceptance risk mitigation.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate being heard, and having a fair chance to be reviewed and considered.\r\n\r\nI also need time for consideration because I am assisting some merchants and users with understanding how to interface with Bitcoin Core and what is happening, so they can express their support for this PR, and their value of zero-conf being useful as a service. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I am advocating for the Bitcoin network state that has thrived for its entire history so far, and asking that Bitcoin Core avoid steering policy.",

          "title": "Proposal for a new mempool design",
          "body": "@sipa and I gave a presentation to some other developers recently about some work we've been doing to redesign how the mempool works, and I wanted to share a writeup outlining our thoughts with a broader audience to further the discussion.  I've also attached a PDF of slides that go along with this: [Reinventing the Mempool.pdf](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/11490409/Reinventing.the.Mempool.pdf).\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\nThe current mempool is primarily designed around maintaining two different sort orders, where for each transaction we keep track of its position in an ancestor-feerate-sort and in a descendant-feerate-sort.  We then use those two cached sort orders in order to implement eviction and mining.\r\n\r\nThose algorithms are deficient in several ways. In particular, the eviction algorithm (which removes the transaction with lowest descendant feerate, along with its descendants) does not guarantee that the first transaction evicted would be the last transaction mined, and there exist situations where we could evict a transaction that would otherwise actually be mined in the next block.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the mining algorithm is more complex than the ancestor feerate sort we maintain, and it is insufficient to merely do lookups into our ancestor feerate index to determine which of two transactions will be mined from the mempool first. This lack of a total ordering on mempool transactions makes RBF calculations difficult to align with miner incentives, and creates distortions where we sometimes can replace transactions via RBF that would actually be better for a miner than the replacement.\r\n\r\nTo solve all these problems, we propose maintaining a total ordering on mempool transactions, which we use to implement a mining and eviction algorithm that are symmetrically opposite and provide better RBF rules for determining when to allow a replacement to occur.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## Eviction and mining are not opposite\r\n\r\nSometimes our eviction criteria might remove something that would be mined in the next block from our mempool. Consider the following transaction graph _(with (ancestor, descendant) feerates in sat/byte in parentheses)_:\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\ngraph TD;\r\n    A[\"Tx A: size 250, fee 250 (1, 2)\"]-->B;\r\n    A-->C;\r\n    A-->E[\"Tx E: size 250, fee 49750 (100, 199)\"];\r\n    B[\"Tx B: size 50000, fee 50000 (1, 2.02)\"]-->D[\"Tx D: size 500, fee 52000 (1.51, 104)\"];\r\n    C[\"Tx C: size 50000, fee 50000 (1, 2.02)\"]-->D;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the ancestor feerate of E is 100 sat/byte, while the descendant feerate of A is 2 sat/byte.  In particular, the descendant feerate of A is lowest among all transactions in this diagram, so if it were also the lowest descendant feerate package in the mempool, then we might evict A, and therefore E, even though (A, E) might otherwise be selected for the next block.\r\n\r\n## RBF is not incentive compatible\r\n\r\nThere are many forms of incentive incompatibility baked into the BIP 125 replacement rules:\r\n * The \"no-new-parents\" rule doesn't consider the replacement transaction's desirability to a miner -- it might be better than all the to-be-replaced transactions, despite the new unconfirmed parent.\r\n * The rule requiring that a new transaction pays a higher feerate than its direct conflicts is insufficient to ensure that the new transaction is more desirable than what is being evicted. One of the direct conflicts could have a smaller set of unconfirmed parents than the new transaction, resulting in a higher ancestor feerate. Moreover, because we don't compare feerates of any indirect conflicts -- that is, descendants of direct conflicts -- with the feerate of the new transaction, it's possible that we're evicting a child transaction that would otherwise be mined in the next block with something that will not be mined for a long time.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26451 for more discussion of the second point.\r\n\r\n# Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIf we're able to maintain a total ordering on the mempool, then we can design efficient algorithms that will solve these problems.\r\n\r\n## How to maintain a total ordering\r\n\r\nWith the current algorithm and rules, it is infeasible to continuously maintain a fully-ordered mempool at all times. Ordering an $n$-transaction mempool from scratch scales with $O(d n \\log n)$, where $d$ is the descendant limit (default 25), which quickly becomes too much when the mempool grows beyond a trivial size. And unfortunately, doing this incrementally (just re-ordering affected transactions whenever updates happen) does not help, because even a single added transaction can change the ordering of all remaining ones.\r\n\r\n[_Edited to use a better example_] As an example of this effect, consider the following transaction graph (all transactions are same size, with ancestor feerates of children in parentheses):\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\ngraph TD;\r\n    A[Tx A: fee 16]-->D[\"Tx D: fee 17 (16.5)\"];\r\n    A-->E[\"Tx E: fee 19 (16)\"];\r\n    B[Tx B: fee 13]-->E;\r\n    B-->F[\"Tx F: fee 23 (14.67)\"];\r\n    C[Tx C: fee 8]-->F;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these ancestor feerates, Tx D should be included first along with its parent Tx A. Once Tx A is included, Tx E will have the next highest ancestor feerate and it is included next with its parent, and so on to produce the ordering: [A, D, B, E, C, F].\r\n\r\nNow consider a single transaction being added, Tx G:\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\ngraph TD;\r\n    A[Tx A: fee 16]-->D[\"Tx D: fee 17 (16.5)\"];\r\n    A-->E[\"Tx E: fee 19 (16)\"];\r\n    B[Tx B: fee 13]-->E;\r\n    B-->F[\"Tx F: fee 23 (14.67)\"];\r\n    C[Tx C: fee 8]-->F;\r\n    C-->G[\"Tx G: fee 29 (18.5)\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTransaction G now has the highest ancestor feerate, and so it would be chosen first in our ancestor-feerate-based ordering. Once Tx G and its parent Tx C are included, Tx F will see its ancestor feerate increase (as it only has one remaining ancestor) to 18, making it the next best to include (along with its parent Tx B). Once Tx B is in, Tx E has the next highest ancestor feerate and we can see that the final ordering of transactions is: [C, G, B, F, A, E, D]. Note that the order in which the child transactions appear has been reversed, and moreover, the number of transactions in this graph could be extended arbitrarily while retaining this behavior.\r\n\r\nFundamentally this means that we need to bound the number of transactions whose ordering can be affected by individual changes to the mempool. Our main insight is that this number is exactly the size of the largest \"cluster\" of transactions that we might have in the mempool, where a \"cluster\" is a maximal set of transactions that are connected via ancestor/descendant relationships in the transaction graph.\r\n\r\nOur proposal is thus to introduce a limit on the size of clusters in the mempool. It then becomes feasible to maintain an ordering for all the individual clusters at all times, and perform a quick merge sort over all of them whenever a total ordering of the entire mempool is needed.\r\n\r\n### Definitions\r\n\r\n#### Clusters\r\n\r\nWe associate the transactions in the mempool with a graph, where each transaction corresponds to a vertex and two transactions are adjacent (ie have an edge between them) if one spends any outputs of the other. We say that two transactions are in the same cluster if there exists a path of edges between them. The overall graph of transactions is partitioned into disjoint clusters, where each transaction is in exactly one cluster. \r\n\r\n#### Linearizations\r\n\r\nWe introduce the term \"linearization\" to refer to any topologically valid ordering of transactions, that is, any ordering of transactions that would be valid in a block under Bitcoin's consensus rules. This could be an ancestor-feerate-based ordering of transactions (like we use in the mining code today), or it could be the optimal ordering (one where we choose amongst all possible subsets of transactions the topologically valid subset that maximizes feerate, and repeat until all transactions are selected).  Or it could be something in between; for the purposes of discussion we abstract away the details of the cluster ordering algorithm, or \"linearization\", that we might settle on.\r\n\r\n#### Chunks\r\n\r\nOur intuition for cluster linearization algorithms is that we often will choose transactions with lower feerate before we choose transactions with higher feerate, because of topology constraints. This is a consequence of behaviors like \"child- pays-for-parent\".  So when thinking about how we might compare transactions from two different clusters to determine which  one is \"better\" (eg for mining) or \"worse\" (eg for eviction), we don't just want to look at the first or last transaction in the cluster. Instead, our intuition is that we want to look at the same package of transactions that our ordering algorithm would have used in coming up with the ordering in the first place.\r\n\r\nThis concept, that transactions should be looked at in some aggregate with other transactions, can be generalized in a way that is indifferent to the underlying linearization algorithm that is used. For a given linearized cluster  $[tx_1, ..., tx_n]$, we can partition the cluster into a series of disjoint \"chunks\" $[c_1, c_2, ..., c_j]$ where $c_1 = [tx_1, ..., tx_{i_1}]$, $c_2 = [tx_{i_1+1}, ..., tx_{i_2}]$ ,..., $c_j = [tx_{i_{j-1}+1}, ..., tx_n]$, such that the feerate of each chunk is no greater than the feerate of the chunk that precedes it. \r\n\r\nAnother way of putting it: chunks are the partitioning of a cluster that respects the linearization in a way that ensures that feerates from one chunk to the next are monotonically decreasing.\r\n\r\n(_Note that due to ties there can be more than one chunking that is compatible with the given definition; generally we'll prefer smaller chunks and therefore not merge together chunks with the same feerate._)\r\n\r\nGiven any cluster linearization, it turns out that it's possible to construct the chunks for the cluster in linear time, and this operation is independent of the linearization algorithm that may have been used.\r\n\r\n### Implementing fundamental mempool operations\r\n\r\nFor the sake of discussion below, let's now imagine that our mempool is grouped into its different clusters, and each cluster is linearized using some algorithm (perhaps the ancestor-feerate-based mining algorithm in use today, or perhaps an optimal ordering), and those linearized clusters are each chunked into their monotonically decreasing feerate order.  Given such a mempool, we can design algorithms to implement the fundamental mempool operations.\r\n\r\n#### Mining\r\n\r\nOur goal with mining is to maximize the fees in a block template, and we do so by applying a greedy algorithm. \r\n\r\n1. Make a highest-feerate-sorted heap consisting of the first chunk from each cluster.  Note that these will be each cluster's highest feerate chunk.\r\n2. While the candidate block is not yet full:\r\n    i. Remove the top of the heap and add to the block candidate.\r\n    ii. If the cluster from which the selection was made has more chunks left, insert the next best chunk from that cluster into the heap.\r\n\r\nNote that when we approach the end of a block, we run into a knapsack problem where chunks may not fit. How we might optimize the end of a block is deferred for later discussion.\r\n\r\n#### Eviction\r\n\r\nOur goal with eviction is to remove the transactions that would be the last ones selected by our mining algorithm. With a  fully ordered mempool, this calculation is straightforward and mirrors the mining algorithm.\r\n\r\n1. Make a lowest-feerate-sorted heap consisting of the last chunk from each cluster. Note that these will be each cluster's lowest feerate chunk.\r\n2. While the mempool is over its size limit:\r\n    i. Remove the top of the heap and evict from the mempool.\r\n    ii. If the cluster from which the selection was made has more chunks left, insert the next lowest feerate chunk from that cluster into the heap.\r\n\r\nAs with our current eviction algorithm, we will also bump up the mempool's minimum fee to be an increment above the highest feerate chunk that was evicted.\r\n\r\n#### RBF\r\n\r\nOur goal with RBF is to allow a \"better\" transaction (something a miner would prefer to have) to evict some existing, conflicting transactions in a way that is DoS-resistant but is otherwise as permissible as practical.\r\n\r\nGiven a mempool where all clusters are ordered and chunked, we can assign a score to a transaction which is the chunk feerate of the chunk to which it belongs.  Then our main RBF incentive compatibility rule just becomes:\r\n\r\n1. A replacement transaction must have a chunk feerate greater than that of all transactions which it would evict.\r\n\r\nThis would eliminate the BIP 125 rule against replacements introducing new unconfirmed parents and replaces the BIP 125 feerate rule in which a replacement transaction must have a higher individual feerate than all direct conflicts.\r\n\r\nHowever, at least for now, we would retain some of the additional anti-DoS rules:\r\n\r\n1. A replacement transaction must pay more total fees than the sum of fees paid by all evicted transactions.\r\n2. A replacement transaction must not evict more than (100?) existing transactions.\r\n\r\nThe first of those rules prevents free-relay attacks, while some version of the second rule is necessary to prevent us from needing to re-cluster/re-order too much of the mempool while processing a single transaction.\r\n\r\n## Some open questions\r\n\r\n1. Philosophically, is it problematic for RBF rules to be even more of a \"black box\" than the BIP 125 algorithm?\r\n2. Are there usage patterns for wallets or other protocols that would be fundamentally harmed by cluster size limits? Do we know what values would be acceptable or what values would be insufficient?\r\n3. What can we do if a high feerate transaction arrives that would violate the cluster limit? Can we design some sort of \"cluster-sibling eviction\" algorithm that is DoS-resistant and would help reduce the downsides of cluster size limits?\r\n4. Is it problematic if linearization algorithms used on the network are non-deterministic?\r\n   * We could imagine using a variety of linearization algorithms at any given moment -- perhaps for small clusters we use an exponential run-time optimal ordering algorithm, while for medium sized clusters we do something different, like an ancestor-feerate-based ordering, or an optimal ordering with some bounded computation limits.\r\n   * Are there situations where different nodes having different orders causes meaningful user-facing issues with transactions not relaying effectively, eg because of the use of chunk feerates in the RBF algorithm?\r\n6. Chunk sizes should be bounded in vbytes, so that we don't exacerbate the knapsack problem during mining. However, what is the best way to do that?\r\n   * We could just bound the vbytes allowed in a single cluster, which would guarantee that chunks are not too big.\r\n   * Or we could design linearization algorithms and adapt our chunking logic to never produce chunks bigger than a certain size -- but this would come at the expense of chunks within a cluster no longer having monotonically decreasing feerates. This may be possible to do, but is the need for large clusters (measured in vbytes) great enough to warrant the complexity that this would introduce in our algorithms?\r\n\r\n# Current status and next steps\r\n\r\n1. First draft implementation of this logic is done (link to be added).\r\n2. Analyzing effects of this logic on historical transaction data is in process, to try to answer questions like:\r\n   * How big are the clusters we've historically seen / what is the cluster size distribution on the network today\r\n   * How would the network have been affected if we'd had cluster sizes bounded at various different values in the past\r\n3. Performance analysis of all the mempool operations (particularly as a function of cluster size) to ensure that mempool operations are optimized with this approach.\r\n4. The information gathered will (eventually) inform a concrete proposal for what cluster size limits we might consider (along with chunk vbyte and/or cluster vbyte limits).\r\n",

          "body": "**WORK IN PROGRESS.** Please do not run it for any use other than testing.\r\n  \r\nThis PR is not meant for merge. This branch exists to help reviewers see what package relay would look like all together. I will open separate PRs for these components and expect to add more tests, docs, and polish along the way. This PR contains all of the functionality built in a linear manner. However, since there are pieces in various areas of the codebase and they can make progress in parallel, commits don't necessarily need to be merged in this order.\r\n\r\n**See #27463 for what PR(s) are open for review right now.**\r\n\r\n## Note to Reviewers\r\n\r\nThe major purpose of this PR is to solicit \"approach\" review.\r\n\r\nThis is a large project, and the first few p2p commits essentially define the interface. I'd like to get rough consensus on approach before we start looking at code details and merging PRs, because I believe it will help us \"get useful stuff in\" faster and avoid premature optimizations.\r\n\r\nHere are some questions I hope are answered before we try to merge anything (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27742#issuecomment-1572205313):\r\n\r\n1. Does the proposed protocol look sound?\r\n2. Are these 3 milestones appropriate?\r\n3. Is there important functionality that is in the \"todo improvements\" section but should be included in one of the 3 milestones? Alternatively, is there not-that-important stuff in the milestones that we should defer until later?\r\n4. Does it make sense to have this PeerManager <-> TxPackageTracker <-> TxOrphanage relationship?\r\n\r\n\r\nComments about naming, typos, code details, etc. are also appreciated but please note I may wait until their respective PRs are open to incorporate your comments. Thank you for your patience.\r\n\r\n## Project Structure\r\n\r\n### 3 Major Milestones\r\n\r\nThis project is split into 3 milestones, each of which gives us something useful.\r\n\r\n1. Modularize and improve orphan-handling (also some refactoring).\r\n\t- Introduce a `TxPackageTracker` class, responsible for orphan handling. It starts out as a wrapper for the `TxOrphanage`.\r\n\t- Use all announcers as potential candidates for resolving an orphan. Add a `TxRequestTracker` Orphan Request Tracker which helps track orphans we need to resolve. Preferentially request orphan resolution from outbounds, preferred relay, etc., over inbounds.\r\n\r\n2. When package relay peers are available, use `ancpkginfo` instead of missing parents when handling orphans.\r\n\t- Add `sendpackages` negotiation logic.\r\n\t- Add a separate rejections filter for transactions that are eligible for reconsideration when validated together as a package, so that children of low-feerate transactions are still considered.\r\n\t- Send `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO)` to package relay peers for orphan resolution. Use `ancpkginfo` to request missing ancestors through normal individual transaction relay.\r\n\r\n3. Download and validate ancestor packages using `getpkgtxns` and `pkgtxns`.\r\n\t- Add support for `getpkgtxns` and `pkgtxns`. Send a `pkgtxns` using the list of missing transactions from `ancpkginfo`.\r\n\t- Ensure we can process \"normal\" orphans even if a peer is trying to overwhelm/churn our orphanage. Do this by \"opportunistically\" protecting orphans from random eviction if they were sent by package relay peers, and redownloading orphans if we cannot afford to protect them. Each peer is allocated a certain amount of orphans they can protect at a time (\"token bucket\" style but the number of tokens is static for now). Outbound peers get more than inbounds.\r\n\t- If a transaction's parent(s) are below the fee filter, don't announce it (save the bandwidth of legacy nodes).\r\n\r\n###  Todo improvements \r\nThese could be added to the milestones or deferred until basic functionality is deployed.\r\n- Store orphans serialized instead of as CTransactionRefs to significantly reduce their memory usage.\r\n- Perhaps try to keep orphans in disk and/or process them asynchronously, given the incredibly DoSable nature of orphan handling.\r\n- Dynamically allocate tokens for orphan protection. For example, if a long-standing inbound peer continuously provides good packages for orphans, they should have more tokens. If a peer is obviously serving us garbage, reduce their tokens.\r\n- Detect when we have received all the transactions for a package, regardless of how (individual or block or other), and return `PackageToValidate`  in `GetTxToReconsider`.\r\n- New format for mempool.dat, packages instead of transactions.",

      "body": "I think this type of policy changes would benefit from a more binding definition of \"incentive compatibility\". If we speak about a world where the network mempools backlog is always superior to `MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT`, optimizing for mining score based on feerate sounds the most obvious. If we add the dimension of mempools congestion variance where emptyness is a non-null outcome, I think a miner could adopt a \"pure-replace-by-fee\" mempool acceptance policy until reaching `MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT`.\r\n\r\nAnother layer of complexity in devising \"incentive compatibility\" could be to realize the best feerate mempool plausible is a combination of the replacement policy and an order of events. E.g, if you evict 2sat/vb A for 4sat/vb A' though after 1 min you receive 4 sat/vb B child of A, your mempool is at loss. This scenario sounds far from unplausible to me in a shared-utxo future (e.g 2-of-2 LN channels), where spenders are building chain of transactions in blindness of every co-spender. A miner mempool optimization could be to run a cache of all the replacements.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, earlier this year on the ML: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-February/019921.html\r\n\r\nOf course, we could make abstraction of order of events complexity by assuming all received transactions are following templates (e.g nversion=3) where the design assumes only the most efficient package/chain of transactions propagate. However, I'm not sure how much our network transaction-relay \"transaction patterns\" (current and future) are realistic of potential miner mempools running with `DEFAULT_ANCESTOR_LIMIT=$HUGE` and out-of-band transaction-relay. If our design give margin for non-marginal fee asymmetries, in a future where fees are significantly contributing to block reward, you should expect some miners doing the efforts of capturing them.\r\n\r\nAll thoughts for future works, I think this is a good improvement for now.",
