      "body": "Concept ACK, but the motivation for this PR could be explained a bit better. \r\n\r\nMy take would be that as it is, Bitcoin Core will spend all types of UTXOs together anyway, so matching a recipient output's type to then spend the funds together with e.g. P2TR outputs in a later transaction would mean that in many cases there would be heavy indication what the change was upon spending (if it wasn't obvious for other tell-tales already). So, as it is, it would seem that output matching provides at best a temporary privacy benefit. On the other hand, legacy outputs incur significantly more cost in blockweight and fees upon spending. So, it seems fine to me to never create legacy outputs unless it's explicitly demanded or unavoidable. @josibake tried to convince me of the benefits of output matching generally recently, so I'd be curious to get a refresher of his arguments on this matter.\r\n\r\nI am actually thinking right now that recipient output type matching could be a lot more beneficial, if we preferentially built input sets for coin selection from a single type of UTXOs. The resulting input sets would probably also be more waste-effective than mixed input sets, as e.g. legacy input sets would be preferred at low feerates and more modern output types should be more attractive at higher feerates than mixed sets of the same input count.",

          "body": "# Concept\r\n\r\nFollowing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23789, Bitcoin Core wallet will now generate a change address that matches the payment address type. This improves privacy by not revealing which of the outputs is the change at the time of the transaction in scenarios where the input address types differ from the payment address type. However, information about the change can be leaked in a later transaction. This proposal attempts to address that concern.\r\n\r\n## Leaking information in a later transaction\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n![mix input types(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7444140/158597086-788339b0-c698-4b60-bd45-9ede4cd3a483.png)\r\n\r\n1. Alice has a wallet with bech32 type UTXOs and pays Bob, who gives her a P2SH address\r\n2. Alice's wallet generates a P2SH change output, preserving her privacy in `txid: a`\r\n3. Alice then pays Carol, who gives her a bech32 address\r\n4. Alice's wallet combines the P2SH UTXO with a bech32 UTXO and `txid: b` has two bech32 outputs\r\n\r\nFrom a chain analysis perspective, it is reasonable to infer that the P2SH input in `txid: b` was the change from `txid: a`. To avoid leaking information in this scenario, Alice's wallet should avoid picking the P2SH output and instead fund the transaction with only bech32 Outputs. If the payment to Carol can be funded with just the P2SH output, it should be preferred over the bech32 outputs as this will convert the P2SH UTXO to bech32 UTXOs via the payment and change outputs of the new transaction.\r\n\r\n**TLDR;** Avoid mixing output types, spend non-default `OutputTypes` when it is economical to do so.\r\n\r\n# Approach\r\n\r\n`AvailableCoins` now populates a struct, which makes it easier to access coins by `OutputType`. Coin selection tries to find a funding solution by each output type and chooses the most economical by waste metric. If a solution can't be found without mixing, coin selection runs over the entire wallet, allowing mixing, which is the same as the current behavior.\r\n\r\nI've also added a functional test (`test/functional/wallet_avoid_mixing_output_types.py`) and unit test (`src/wallet/test/availablecoins_tests.cpp`.",

Also, commit `wallet: switch to new shuffle, erase, push_back` will fail to compile, but this is fixed in the next commit with a scripted-diff. the commits are separate like this (code change then scripted-diff) to improve legibility.\r\n",

          "title": "wallet: group outputs only once, decouple it from Coin Selection",
          "body": "The idea originates from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24845#issuecomment-1130310321.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nFor clarity, it's recommended to start reviewing from the end result to understand the structure of the flow.\r\n\r\n#### GroupOutputs function rationale:\r\nIf \"Avoid Partial Spends\" is enabled, the function gathers outputs with the same script together inside a container. So Coin Selection can treats them as if them were just one possible input and either select them all or not select them. \r\n\r\n#### How the Inputs Fetch + Selection process roughly works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Fetch user’s manually selected inputs.\r\n2. Fetch wallet available coins (walks through the entire wallet txes map) and insert them into a set of vectors (each vector store outputs from a single type).\r\n3. Coin Selection Process:\r\n   Call `AttemptSelection` 8 times. Each of them expands the coin eligibility filter (accepting a larger subset of coins in the calculation) until it founds a solutions or completely fails if no solutions gets founds after the 8 rounds.\r\n\r\n   Each `AttemptSelection` call performs the following actions:\r\n     - For each output type supported by the wallet (P2SH, P2PK, P2WPKH, P2WSH and a combination of all of them):\r\n       Call ‘ChooseSelectionResult’ providing the respective, filtered by type, coins vector. Which:\r\n           I. Groups the outputs vector twice (one for positive only and a second one who includes the negative ones as well).\r\n              - GroupOutputs walks-through the entire inputted coins vector one time at least, + more if we are avoiding partial spends, to generate a vector of OutputGroups.\r\n           II. Then performs every coin selection algorithm using the recently created vector of OutputGroup: (1) BnB, (2) knapsack and (3) SRD.\r\n           III. Then returns the best solution out of them.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe perform the general operation of gathering outputs, with the same script, into a single container inside:\r\nEach coins selection attempt (8 times —> each coin eligibility filter), for each of the outputs vector who were filtered by type (plus another one joining all the outputs as well if needed), twice (one for the positive only outputs effective value and a second one for all of them).\r\n\r\nSo, in the worst case scenario where no solution is found after the 8 Coin Selection attempts, the `GroupOutputs` function is called 80 times (8 * 5 * 2).\r\n\r\n#### Improvements:\r\n\r\nThis proposal streamlines the process so that the output groups, filtered by coin eligibility and type, are created in a single loop outside of the Coin Selection Process. \r\n\r\nThe new process is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Fetch user’s manually selected inputs.\r\n2. Fetch wallet available coins.\r\n3. Group outputs by each coin eligibility filter and each different output type found.\r\n4. Coin Selection Process: \r\n   Call AttemptSelection 8 times. Each of them expands the coin eligibility filter (accepting different output groups) until it founds a solutions or completely fails if no solutions gets founds after the 8 rounds.\r\n   \r\n   Each ‘AttemptSelection’ call performs the following actions:\r\n      - For each output type supported by the wallet (P2SH, P2PK, P2WPKH, P2WSH and all of them):\r\n          A. Call ‘ChooseSelectionResult’ providing the respective, filtered by type, output group. Which:\r\n             I. Performs every coin selection algorithm using the provided vector of OutputGroup: (1) BnB, (2) knapsack and (3) SRD.\r\n             II. Then returns the best solution out of them.\r\n```\r\n\r\nExtra Note:\r\nThe next steps after this PR will be to:\r\n1) Merge `AvailableCoins` and `GroupOutputs` processes.\r\n2) Skip entire coin selection rounds if no new coins are added into the subsequent round.\r\n3) Remove global feerates from the OutputGroup class.\r\n4) Remove secondary \"grouped\" tx creation from `CreateTransactionInternal` by running Coin Selection results over the aps grouped outputs vs non-aps ones.",

      "body": "I've been thinking more about the proposed change here. I would argue that before #24584, matching output types mostly improved privacy temporarily for the time between a transaction was created and the change output was spent, as the circumstances in which the change was later spent would more often reveal that it was the change, e.g. when it got spent together with more modern outputs which would indicate that the other output probably was the cause for using legacy outputs. There might have been more of a benefit if the change was a solitary input on the next transaction. However, especially given that there are many other heuristics that also hint at the change output, it seemed a bit unreasonable to increase the future cost of spending the change output by a factor 2.17× for this tenuous privacy benefit.\r\n\r\nAfter #24584 our wallets are presumably achieving single-type input sets for most transactions, and this actually changes the benefit of matching legacy outputs more to a question of “privacy vs cost”. Although other heuristics that allow recognizing change would still not be impacted (e.g. based on amounts, or general wallet fingerprints matching between original and change transaction but not recipient transaction), but at least the legacy output is less likely to be mixed in with other outputs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is also a meta question of whether creating more legacy outputs helps sustain the acceptability of legacy use. Fewer legacy outputs on the network in general would also make matching legacy and then later spending legacy stick out more. Right now feerates are extremely low, so maybe the additional cost is currently worth the privacy benefit, but if the feerates go up significantly again, sitting on more legacy outputs would be more costly—although they should get selected quickly at the current low feerates as well. And potential higher feerates in the future would prompt more people to switch to blockweight-efficient output types to lower their own future cost, which would reduce our creation of legacy outputs in turn then.\r\n\r\nSo, perhaps we don't need to get active at this time and remove matching of legacy outputs now. Most of the downsides will fix themselves in the long run anyway, and at current feerates the cost is likely low anyway.\r\n\r\nI.e. code looks good to me, I could see the argument go either way for various reasons.",

Not trying to block something at last moment that has lot of consensus but this PR started with disagreements. \r\n\r\nFinding change in a transaction is a big win for chain analysis algos and @MarcoFalke did a great work in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23789 that would make it difficult. There were some issues which @josibake partially fixed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24584. This is a rare event in bitcoin core and I dont want to undo it.\r\n\r\nℹ️ Even samourai (privacy wallet) has not fixed the issues mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24584\r\n\r\nPrivacy matters a lot in bitcoin but wasn't appreciated by everyone and I have seen comments for PRs in past (Example: Coin Control being opposed by one influential dev in 2011). In some cases bank accounts provide better privacy for clients. They don't broadcast every transaction, we do. So change address plays an important role in UTXO transactions. \r\n\r\nWorld is not going to end if some users send bitcoin to legacy address using bitcoin core wallet which is already less used. However, this may inspire other projects using bitcoin core RPC.",

      "body": "> Why not? If the user is sending bitcoin to legacy address it should be okay to use a legacy change address by default.\r\n\r\nNot necessarily. The user is sending Bitcoin to an address given to them by the recipient - they have no control over that address type. However the user may want to use segwit or taproot because those types are cheaper when spending. In a scenario where the user is trying to optimize for least fees (which many users do), it is actually not okay to send to change to legacy because that will incur higher fees in the future.\r\n\r\n> This affects privacy and makes no sense.\r\n\r\nPrivacy is not the end all be all of wallet design. Bitcoin Core's wallet is not a privacy focused wallet - we do not advertise as being private nor is privacy the primary focus. We try to encourage privacy and implement privacy improving behavior, but not to the detriment of other factors, such as cost to the user and effect on all the other nodes in the network. Given that legacy address types cost more to the user, cost more in block space, and can cost more to validate (in terms of CPU time), I think it is better for us to avoid making legacy outputs as much as possible, and that would include the contents of this PR. While it does have a negative impact on privacy, I do not think that the privacy gained from this behavior outweights the effects that continued legacy use has on everyone else.\r\n\r\nA potential alternative is to add an option that enables strict change type matching. Instead of removing this behavior entirely, it can be put behind a startup option or a transaction creation option so that users who do want the additional privacy can choose to enable it.",

And potential higher feerates in the future would prompt more people to switch to blockweight-efficient output types to lower their own future cost, which would reduce our creation of legacy outputs in turn then.\r\n> \r\n> So, perhaps we don't need to get active at this time and remove matching of legacy outputs now. Most of the downsides will fix themselves in the long run anyway, and at current feerates the cost is likely low anyway.\r\n\r\nThis sums up my feelings on this. I'd add that high feerates is a future problem, whereas privacy is a current problem. Not saying that we shouldn't be optimizing for fees now, but rather saying that I'd prefer we improve privacy today with slight tradeoffs in efficiency vs solutions that improve efficiency today at the expensive of privacy.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth mentioning that there are often ways to intervene with inefficient UTXOs (e.g migrating legacy UTXOs to newer types manually in low fee periods, improved coin-selection algos that are fee and address type aware, etc), whereas damaging privacy on-chain is a permanent mistake.\r\n",

I care about the changes in this pull request because neither I want to make such mistakes in bitcoin transactions nor I want to see others being affected. Example:\r\n\r\nAlice: I just a did a transaction using bitcoin core and chainalysis won't be able to find change address in this\r\n\r\nBob: I hope you didn't send it to legacy address?\r\n\r\nAlice: :cry:\r\n\r\n`bumpfee` RPC doesn't even allow users selecting inputs, change etc.\r\n\r\nPrivacy is more important than other things and if this bothers some developers, there should be an option in GUI and bitcoin.conf to optimize certain things in transactions based on fees, privacy etc. Example:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94559964/184239543-9ce290ad-ad46-4605-8567-ce228a437ede.png)\r\n\r\nAt least users won't have to carefully look at several things when doing bitcoin transactions.\r\n\r\n> The argument is not about whether there is a privacy benefit (we all agree), but about **how the privacy benefit weighs compared to the increased cost**. I would request that you provide evidence for the tradeoff being worth it rather than just repeatedly demanding the best possible privacy at any cost—the former would be a contribution to the conversation, the latter lacks nuance and becomes just noise.\r\n\r\n1. I am not demanding anything. I am disagreeing with the changes in this pull request as a reviewer and responding to comments.\r\n\r\n2. If we all agree there is a privacy benefit in not merging this pull request there is no point in speculating about future fees and fingerprints. If change address could be identified using other things, we should try to fix them if possible and not make things worse. If they really affect privacy then #23789 #24584 are useless and should never have been merged.\r\n\r\n> Also, if you don't mind, which other wallets match Bitcoin Core's fingerprints?\r\n\r\nBluewallet: Version 2, Locktime 0\r\nBlockstream Green: Version 2, Locktime 0\r\nHexa: Version 2, Locktime 0\r\n\r\nI am sure there might be more wallets that use same version and locktime. Some wallets also match the fingerprint partially because either locktime or version matches. Wallets that use Bitcoin Core RPC which I had also mentioned in earlier comments would most probably have the same fingerprint. Transactions could even be sent to other bitcoin core user. \r\n\r\n-- -\r\n\r\nI am working as developer for an exchange and we will be using bitcoin core wallets so it can be added to the list of exchanges that use same fingerprint.",

      "body": "#23789 and #24584 clearly were privacy improvements. While the former traded that off for additional cost, the latter actually seems to result both in a privacy improvement and a cost reduction. I agree with you that we should continue to work on removing privacy leaks. If you're looking for a project that is 100% focused on privacy, you will continue to be disappointed.\r\n\r\nBeyond that I think it's fair I explain myself to you before going back to mostly ignoring you:\r\nI get that you consider privacy the utmost priority. It's a valid point-of-view, and valuable for the project someone take that position. However, Bitcoin Core has a heterogeneous user base. While you care deeply for privacy, other users might care more about other things, e.g. usability or fees. Our decision should consider all of our users' needs, not just yours, and must be achievable within the available resources we an muster: we must consider security, reliability, privacy, cost, feasibility, maintainability, usability, relatability, and current network circumstances, etc.…\r\n\r\nWhile you appear to gladly suffer any sort of discomfort, costs, and overabundance of configuration options (which need to be developed, maintained, documented, and may be confusing to users) for better privacy, another user might be surprised and annoyed to pay more than twice the fees and never even consider changing defaults. While the additional cost is easy to denominate, the privacy reduction is not a binary all-or-nothing as you make it out to be, but depends on its actual real-world effect in context of the transaction's publication. Privacy is inherently contextual to the corresponding UTXO pool, the involved parties, the unique transaction history they appear in as well as what everyone else is doing on the network and the threat-model you're considering.\r\n\r\nAs someone that does care above average about privacy (and has contributed to a number of privacy improvements over the years), but does not hold the \"privacy-at-any-cost\" position, frankly, I consider your constant barrage of “contributions” to the mailing list, issues and PRs a disservice to our goals. By intransigently taking the fundamental position “privacy-over-everything” and _piss-poorly arguing for it_, you're undermining more nuanced discussions on the topics you care most about and inject noise that hampers progress. Perhaps you should consider whether your actions actually further your goals or whether you're doing more harm than good.",

We have already made it difficult to make legacy addresses through the GUI (starting with `-addresstype=legacy` is the only way). The default address type is bech32. So it seems that we should consider stop automatically generating legacy, and probably p2sh-segwit, descriptors.\r\n\r\nThis would simply be removing the automatic creation of descriptors for the `LEGACY` and `P2SH_SEGWIT` output types for new wallets. We would still retain the ability to spend those outputs, parse those descriptors, and make those types of addresses if the user's wallet has descriptors for these output types. Additionally, if a user wanted to add such a descriptor to their wallet, they could via `importdescriptors`. There can also be some RPC which can add an automatically generated single key descriptor of whatever type that could legacy and p2sh-segwit descriptors to the wallet. Such an RPC would be the generic version of the one that will add `tr` descriptors (or perhaps the same RPC).",
