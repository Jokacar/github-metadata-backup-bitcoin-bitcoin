This paper describes Clang Thread Safety Analysis, a tool which uses annotations to declare and enforce thread safety policies in C and C++ programs.\r\n> [â€¦]\r\n> It has been deployed on a large scale at Google; all C++ code at Google is now compiled with thread safety analysis enabled by default.\r\n> [â€¦]\r\n> The GUARDED_BY attribute declares that a thread must lock `mu` before it can read or write to `balance`, thus ensuring that the increment and decrement operations are atomic. Similarly,\r\nREQUIRES declares that the calling thread must lock mu before calling `withdrawImpl`. Because the caller is assumed to have locked `mu,` it is safe to modify `balance` within the body of the method.",

Switching the primitives in the sync module from boost to std should be done in an atomic commit, without doing any other change.\r\n\r\nI didn't know about this pull request before opening issue #11166 (from which you referred me here), I'm pretty close to having that ready to open a pull request, (just changing boost to std). Will update here when it's ready. I think it'd be better if that were reviewed and merged, and only then follow up with other changes. \r\nEDIT: Opened pull request #11199 ",

          "body": "Add additional Clang thread safety analysis annotations as discussed with @sipa (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10866#issuecomment-316238630) and others.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to #10866 ~~which this PR is rebased upon (awaiting merge of #10866). The first three commits (8a1dc09, e022990 and cbae151) can be reviewed in #10866.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR contains three types of changes:\r\n1. Add missing locks (based on the `GUARDED_BY(...)` analysis below). Please review thoroughly.\r\n2. Add `GUARDED_BY(...)` annotations to allow for Clang's thread safety analysis at compile-time. Does not change run-time behaviour.\r\n3. Add `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(...)` annotations to allow for Clang's thread safety analysis at compile-time. Does not change run-time behaviour.\r\n\r\nBackground reading: The [\"C/C++ Thread Safety Analysis\"](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/42958.pdf) paper (Hutchins, Ballman & Sutherland, 2014) paper describing Clang thread safety analysis and how it is used for the Google C++ codebase:\r\n\r\n> They essentially provide a static type system for threads, and can detect potential race conditions and deadlocks. This paper describes Clang Thread Safety Analysis, a tool which uses annotations to declare and enforce thread safety policies in C and C++ programs.\r\n> [â€¦]\r\n> It has been deployed on a large scale at Google; all C++ code at Google is now compiled with thread safety analysis enabled by default.\r\n> [â€¦]\r\n> The `GUARDED_BY` attribute declares that a thread must lock `mu` before it can read or write to `balance`, thus ensuring that the increment and decrement operations are atomic. Similarly, `REQUIRES` declares that the calling thread must lock mu before calling `withdrawImpl`. Because the caller is assumed to have locked `mu,` it is safe to modify `balance` within the body of the method.",

Not making the actual fix in this commit to maintain max compatibility with previous behavior.\r\n\r\nResolves #11166 ",

Not standing for non-canon, heâ€™ll ban and heâ€™ll ban. Some heroes wear capes, but BanMan? A Bandana.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDespite the diff size, this is mostly move-only. It breaks the ban/unban functions out of CConnman and into a new class because, while logically bans are tied to connections, they're really just entries in a database. Like CConnman, a global is still required due to RPC (and qt). I plan to address this along with CAddrMan, which I'll be breaking out next.\r\n\r\nThis also makes testing easier as different implementations can be dropped in.\r\n\r\nThere are a few small behavioral changes here, which are pretty insignificant:\r\n- Banning no longer implies disconnecting. If you want both, you need to call both.\r\n- For simplicity, The ban db is read in the constructor, meaning that it happens in init rather than net.\r\n- RPC returns RPC_DATABASE_ERROR if the bandb is not loaded. This should not be possible now, but the idea is for future changes to allow us to disable p2p but still interact with the ban commands.",

You can squash these changes into the \"Fix -Wthread-safety-analysis warnings\" commit, which should make it smaller.",

          "body": "While cherry-picking upstream locking PRs (for example, #5034), I've come across several that add clang [thread safety annotations](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html). These additional checks occur at compile-time, but have no effect on our default build; they require the `-Wthread-safety` compile (`clang++`) argument. Enabling this warning generates many warnings. I consulted with @zebambam, and he says that at least some of the warnings, maybe most, are false-positives.\r\n\r\nThis ticket is to suggest that we may want to spend some effort trying to build cleanly with `-Wthread-safety`, or, if that's not practical, to fix any real bugs that are discovered along the way. I'm not sure if it's worth spending any effort at all, but this ticket serves to at least document this topic.\r\n\r\nHere are relevant upstream PRs that we haven't merged yet:\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10866\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16127\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18635",
