    "title": "Balance calculation and coin selection should arrive at the same conclusions",
    "body": "Currently balance calculation and coin selection operate completely independently of each other, and have slightly different criteria for determining what outputs should be included in their respective calculations. This results in their conclusions differing from each other in various edge cases which can be very confusing to users. They should probably be unified so that computed balances match the available utxos that coin selection may choose from.\r\n\r\nA possible solution is to have the wallet actually track its (U)TXOs and compute the balance and available coins from that, rather than each having to iterate all txs in the wallet and try to figure out what's relevant.",

Not sure about the performance implication, but if the approach is OK, caching can also be used with this solution.\r\n\r\nThis approach also fixes the bug mentioned at the end of the `wallet_abandonconflict.py` file.",
