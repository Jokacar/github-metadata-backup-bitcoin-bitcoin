    "body": "\r\nSome of the README contents in **doc/** seems to be misplaced, and I suspect it is an heritage from before QT was merged upstream. Mainly I'm thinking about a few instances of _Unpack the files into a directory, and then..._ (and similarly) and also the entire file **doc/README_windows.txt**.\r\n\r\nThere may be reasons for this that I don't know about. However, in my opinion, all instructions related to running an already built version of Bitcoin Core belong on bitcoincore.org only, not duplicated (poorly) in the developer documentation. Except for maybe the last line of the build instructions.\r\nThe README already links to the releases page, which is nice. \r\n\r\nIs this about right? If so, I'd be happy to supply a related PR. \r\n",

This PR fixes that by instead linking to the official docs about running a node. \r\n \r\nAlso, changed the download link to point to the download page instead of the releases page.\r\n\r\nThis is a near-duplicate of [PR14755](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14755) that was closed (maybe prematurely).  Please see that PR for some discussion.",
