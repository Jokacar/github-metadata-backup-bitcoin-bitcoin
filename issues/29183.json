    "body": "This issue will be edited frequently to reflect the current status of the project.\r\n\r\n#### What should I review now? \r\n\r\n👇 👇 👇 👇 \r\n-- #28955 --\r\n☝️ ☝️ ☝️ ☝️\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to enable complete blockchain rescan capability on prune nodes, allowing these storage-limited nodes to import new wallet descriptors and update existing ones at any time, as well as loading external and un-synced wallets with a birth-time older than 48 hours. This, in turn, enables the monitoring of new addresses/scripts and tracking balance changes without the need to repeatedly download the entire blockchain.\r\n\r\nThe first project milestone introduces the feature for prune nodes that construct and maintain a local block filters set database. The node will request and keep track of the missing historical blocks that match the wallet scripts filters set to subsequently perform the rescan.\r\n\r\n#### The following sections are ordered by their PRs dependencies:\r\n\r\n##### Net: Single Block Requests Tracking System and On Download Failure Retry Mechanism\r\n* [x] #28170\r\n* [x] #28120\r\n* [ ] #27837\r\n\r\n##### Indexes Stability and Performance Improvements\r\n* [X] #27607\r\n* [X] #27720\r\n* [ ] #28955\r\n* [ ] #26966\r\n\r\n##### Wallet Rescan (depends on the net section)\r\n* [X] #27469\r\n* [ ] Cache wallet filters' set and connect it to the current wallet rescan functionality. (Pending)\r\n* [ ] Wallet: implement \"rescan status\" class to track the progress and retrieve it via an RPC command. (Pending)\r\n* [ ] Wallet: introduce prune node rescan functionality.

Prune: last wallet synchronisation goes beyond pruned data.

Start Bitcoin-qt\r\n2. Select File->Open Wallet->[Wallet name]\r\n\r\nReproducible every time in prune mode. The wallet was created at the time for which data were pruned.

In\r\nsuch cases, upon reconnecting to the network, the node might only establish\r\nconnections with limited peers, filling up all available outbound slots.

          "body": "Coming from #27652, part of #29183.\r\n\r\nThe general idea is to keep track of the user requested blocks so, in\r\ncase of a bad behaving peer or a network disconnection, they can be\r\nfetched from another one automatically without any further user interaction.\r\n\r\nThis was requested by users because the `getblockfrompeer` RPC command\r\nlacks the functionality to notify them about block request failures or peer\r\ndisconnections (which is expected due to the asynchronous nature of the block\r\nrequests).\r\n\r\nCurrently, this new functionality is limited to blocks requested by the\r\nuser via the 'getblockfrompeer' RPC command.\r\n\r\nIn the future, this class could expand its scope and be utilized in the\r\nregular chain synchronization process. Or, even could be employed in\r\nspecial procedures like a prune node rescan that uses BIP158 block filters,\r\nor even into BIP157 itself.",
