    "title": "Minor bug? CalculateAncestorsAndCheckLimits off-by-one error when checking ancestor/descendant count limits",
    "body": "A subtle (and minor) bug in how limits are calculated & checked in `CalculateAncestorsAndCheckLimits` https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/txmempool.cpp#L207\r\n\r\nThis helper can be invoked in a few cases:\r\n\r\n1. `CTxMemPool::CalculateMemPoolAncestors` invokes it, if `fSearchForParents` is `true`, and `entry` is not in the mempool, then `CalculateAncestorsAndCheckLimits` will be exact/correct.\r\n2. `CTxMemPool::CalculateMemPoolAncestors` invokes it, in the cases where `entry` is already in the mempool, we have an off-by-one error here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/txmempool.cpp#L230 (because `stageit->GetCountWithDescendants()` will include `entry` in its count\r\n\r\n**So (2) highlights the case where there's a bug, and it's quite common.**\r\n\r\nWe also need to think about how `CTxMemPool::CheckPackageLimits` uses this helper. I think it works better in this case because we have the assumption:\r\n```\r\nCalculate all in-mempool ancestors of a set of transactions not already in the mempool and\r\n* check ancestor and descendant limits\r\n```\r\nie we know none of the txns in `package` are in the mempool. So no double counting.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI doubt this is a serious bug, but I though it's at least worth bringing up. It also seemed tricky to fix this with minimal/simple changes that works in all cases this helper is/may be used.\r\n\r\nie here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/txmempool.cpp#L309, when `fSearchForParents` is `true` and one/some of the parents of this transaction **are not** in the mempool. Currently these parents (and any of their potential ancestors) are not included in the unconfirmed parents check. Again I don't know if this actually matters, or if its unnecessary complexity, but want to check",

          "title": "Implement RBF inherited signaling and fix getmempoolentry returned bip125-replaceable status",
          "body": "This PR is on top of #22867 which adds test coverage relevant to this PR, and motivates it by highlighting some of the behavior this improves upon.\r\n\r\nIt aims to resolve issue #22209 as well as [CVE-2021-31876](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-31876)\r\n> Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- As a followup to this PR I think some fuzz testing would be useful.\r\n- Also an optimization followup can be done, putting some stricter bounds on `IsRBFOptIn` when it invokes `CalculateMemPoolAncestors`. However, I don't do that in this PR to keep it as simple as possible, and I don't think it's necessary. a) default mempool limits are much stricter than BIP125 Rule 5's `MAX_BIP125_REPLACEMENT_CANDIDATES{100}`, because `DEFAULT_DESCENDANT_LIMIT == 25`. b) I don't see a major performance tradeoff (please double check me). I think https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/mempool_updatefromblock.py is a good worst-case scenario stress test for additional runtime required to check for inherited signaling, and this test seems to run in approx the same amount of time after this PR. Which seems acceptable to me, and not a risk for a DOS vector. But again, please be critical of this in the review. I also noticed #23621 when testing, and would like to see where that lands before I try any optimization.",

      "body": "This is a good observation: the `if (stageit->GetCountWithDescendants() + entry_count > limitDescendantCount)` condition will overestimate the descendant count when entry is an in-mempool descendant of the entry in `stageit`. In the 3 cases you've nicely enumerated, this logic is only hit when `CalculateMemPoolAncestors()` is called for an in-mempool entry:\r\n\r\n> CTxMemPool::CalculateMemPoolAncestors invokes it, in the cases where entry is already in the mempool, we have an off-by-one error here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/txmempool.cpp#L230 (because stageit->GetCountWithDescendants() will include entry in its count\r\n\r\nIn practice, these calls are always made with ancestor/descendant limits set to `noLimit` (see calls in [miner.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e521c5589e253b1a6631d085b3ac578751883082/src/node/miner.cpp#L403-L405), [mempool removal](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/txmempool.cpp#L414), and verify by grepping for `CalculateMemPoolAncestors(... false)`). While this means the \"bug\" never results in a failure due to the overestimation, it is brittle to rely on this caller behavior.\r\n\r\nRe: correctness in `CheckPackageLimits`, `package` will never contain in-mempool entries. It would currently result in a rejected package; in the future, we will de-duplicate and remove already-in-mempool transactiosn from the argument passed in to `CheckPackageLimits()`. If you're curious, see [this assertion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22290/commits/cda84edb0953beb2220621fa517abd6d8f5dc3d9#diff-97c3a52bc5fad452d82670a7fd291800bae20c7bc35bb82686c2c0a4ea7b5b98R958-R960) in the draft implementation.\r\n\r\nThanks for bringing this up @mjdietzx. This is not an issue in practice, but is brittle code that can be patched pretty simply, e.g. by creating separate interfaces/code paths for an in-mempool and outside-mempool entry. We can group it in with a refactor, e.g. making the limits members of txmempool.",

      "body": "Thanks, nice write-up @glozow. Agreed on all points. And after reading your comment and double checking codebase I realize that the incorrect case \"case 2\" is not currently hit.\r\n\r\nAnyways I do think the code is brittle and there's room for improvement (I may give it another try making it a little more robust myself) in `CalculateAncestorsAndCheckLimits`. And in a followup to #22698 I may try optimizing `IsRBFOptIn` a bit by putting a hard bound here, where \"case 2\" would be hit:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\npool.CalculateMemPoolAncestors(entry, ancestors, noLimit, noLimit, /* limitDescendantCount= */ MAX_BIP125_REPLACEMENT_CANDIDATES, noLimit, dummy, false);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's a little more to it (the optimization), but that just highlights the case where the caller (myself a week ago) encounters some unexpected behavior with `CalculateMemPoolAncestors`",

          "title": "Use util::Result in for calculating mempool ancestors",
          "body": "Upon reviewing the documentation for `CTxMemPool::CalculateMemPoolAncestors`, I noticed `setAncestors` was meant to be an `out` parameter but actually is an `in,out` parameter, as can be observed by adding `assert(setAncestors.empty());` as the first line in the function and running `make check`. This PR fixes this unexpected behaviour and introduces refactoring improvements to make intents and effects of the code more clear.\r\n\r\n## Unexpected behaviour\r\nThis behaviour occurs only in the package acceptance path, currently only triggered by `testmempoolaccept` and `submitpackage` RPCs. \r\n\r\nIn `MemPoolAccept::AcceptMultipleTransactions()`, we first call `PreChecks()` and then `SubmitPackage()` with the same `Workspace ws` reference. `PreChecks` leaves `ws.m_ancestors` in a potentially non-empty state, before it is passed on to `MemPoolAccept::SubmitPackage`. `SubmitPackage` is the only place where `setAncestors` isn't guaranteed to be empty before calling `CalculateMemPoolAncestors`. The most straightforward fix is to just forcefully clear `setAncestors` at the beginning of CalculateMemPoolAncestors, which is done in the first bugfix commit.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n### Return value instead of out-parameters\r\nThis PR updates the function signatures for `CTxMemPool::CalculateMemPoolAncestors` and `CTxMemPool::CalculateAncestorsAndCheckLimits` to use a `util::Result` return type and eliminate both the `setAncestors` `in,out`-parameter as well as the error string. It simplifies the code and makes the intent and effects more explicit.\r\n\r\n### Observability\r\nThere are 7 instances where we currently call `CalculateMemPoolAncestors` without actually checking if the function succeeded because we assume that it can't fail, such as in [miner.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/69b10212ea5370606c7a5aa500a70c36b4cbb58f/src/node/miner.cpp#L399). This PR adds a new wrapper `AssumeCalculateMemPoolAncestors` function that logs such unexpected failures, or in case of debug builds even halts the program. It's not crucial to the objective, more of an observability improvement that seems sensible to add on here.",
