    "body": "This patch creates four threads for connecting to the P2P network on startup. This allows more attempts based on peers.dat before the timeout for connecting to two peers hits and the DNS seeds are queried for more peers. Once an initial quorum of outbound peers are connected, these extra threads end, and long term behaviour continues unchanged.\r\n\r\nFixes #15434 \r\n\r\nMarked as draft, looking for concept acks. Second patch just dumps some statistics on how successful connections are (successful = connection established, not a VERACK actually received). I get 20%-30% on initial startup; after running a while seems to be down to ~17%.",

          "body": "This is an implementation of [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518), using primitives in the BIP-330 (see the updated spec [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki)). Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk on the topic is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670).\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I'll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n- save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n- increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n- improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\nObviously looking for review, let's try to start with a high-level concerns, and keep nits for later.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nPlease don't be scared of 8,000 LOC added. 7,000 of them is minisketch added as a subtree.\r\n\r\nP.P.S.\r\nMy experiments of running this code live (slightly outdated) with a script to replicate the experiment: [here1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#issuecomment-599241490) and [here2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#issuecomment-600388543).\r\n",

Later I want to add #18421 to the scheduler too.\r\n\r\n@laanwj initially suggested to use libevent for #18421, but @thebluematt pointed out that it’s undesirable to add that extra dependency on somewhat limited non-standard libevent functions.\r\nMatt also suggested an idea of this PR as an alternative. \r\n\r\nI suggest to compare the safety of this approach to status-quo (which seems to be working well).\r\nIf we’ll have 2 threads for scheduler, the requirement is *at most one long blocking task is allowed*.\r\n\r\nRight now, everything in scheduling is pretty fast. Tor stuff and OpenAddedConnections both seem to be fast too (that’s where I’d use some extra eyes and experience!), so we’re safe, and there’s even room for an extra task. (#18421).\r\n\r\nIf there are any concerns, note that we can drop either Tor or OpenAddedConnections from the scheduler, and still be fine. Or we can add third thread to the scheduler, and be even with status quo.",
