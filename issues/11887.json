    "title": "Could the wallet count unconfirmed non-mempool change?",
    "body": "Just writing down some thoughts on this.\r\n\r\nI find it quite counter-intuitive that if you have a 1 BTC output and make a transaction spending 0.01 BTC and sending 0.99 BTC back to yourself in change, that unless that transaction is in your mempool, your balance drops from 1 to 0.   Unconfirmed change in the mempool appears in available balance (assuming we can spend 0-conf change), but if it is not in the mempool it is not reflected at all, but the output spent in the transaction is still spent.\r\n\r\nThis can occur because walletbroadcast=0 and you're delaying broadcast or using another broadcast method or because the initial transaction was evicted.  In either case though it doesn't make sense to count the entire input as spent but not credit the change output.\r\n\r\nI believe it would make sense to include the unconfirmed non-mempool change in the pending balance.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is non-trivial.  This can best be seen by the example of two transactions in the wallet that spend the same input.  Naively you'd double count the change, which is clearly wrong.  It's non-obvious which change you should count nor how you would go about implementing that if you did have a plan.  One idea would be if you had a mempool package acceptance test (ala @sdaftuar) you could try to add all non-mempooled wallet transactions incrementally in time order, and take the resulting putative mempool state as what would count.  But its starting to get a bit cumbersome.  Another idea would be to check the unconfirmed non-mempool change for potential conflicts and only count the smallest change.\r\n\r\nThere are other aspects of trickiness such as mixed debit transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This simplifies the code and changes two things:\r\n\r\n* Importing `tr` descriptors can be done before the chain is fully synced. This is fine, because the wallet will already generate `tr` descriptors by default (regardless of the taproot status) after commit 47fe7445e7f54aee10ec6dbc53f1db1adbeb43de.\r\n* Valid taproot spends won't be rejected from the mempool before taproot is active. This is strictly speaking a bugfix after commit 47fe7445e7f54aee10ec6dbc53f1db1adbeb43de, since the wallet may generate taproot spends before the chain is fully synced. For example, a slow node or a purposefully offline node. Currently, the wallet needs the mempool to account for change. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11887.\r\n\r\nA similar change was done for segwit v0 in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13120 .\r\n\r\nThis effectively reverts commit c5ec0367d718544caa3a1578d6c730fc92ee4e94.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "It would be nice if there was a way to tell core to only broadcast transactions over Tor, but use clearnet for everything else.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell the only way to guarantee transaction broadcast over Tor is to use onlynet=onion, which means that all network traffic goes over Tor. The problem is that this introduces latency for blocks/confirmations and transactions. Some users might only want to use Tor to try to protect \"first broadcast\" transaction origin analysis which can be a problem with sybil attacking clearnet nodes. This can still be a problem on Tor as well, but can be more difficult to pull off.\r\n\r\nSome bitcoin software such as wasabi and joinmarket already implement this by establishing a new Tor circuit, broadcasting the transaction, and then disconnecting. Perhaps bitcoin could do this as well?\r\n\r\nSome things that were brought up when I mentioned this on IRC by @naumenkogs, @luke-jr  and others:\r\n\r\nFor the resistance to first-broadcast analysis to be effective, the node should treat the transaction as if it wasn't theirs to begin with. I'm not familiar with the network code, so I'm not sure if anything would have to change relay policy-wise.\r\n\r\nWould be happy to hear other thoughts on what would be required to implement this, or if there's something I'm missing, as it's something I would be interested in implementing if there are enough concept acks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR rationale:\r\n\r\n- A nodes wants to recieve blocks/confirmations/transactions as soon as possible with the lowest latency\r\n\r\n- A node wants increased broadcast privacy without paying the full cost of onlynet=tor latency\r\n",

Currently few wallets support tor broadcasting within the wallet. Except for Electrum Personal Server, electrum servers don't support tor broadcasting, and EPS as the name suggests is not fit for a public electrum server.\r\n\r\nThus, an modern Electrum server fit for public use that supports broadcasting transactions over tor could increase transaction privacy for many users.",

          "title": "[WIP] p2p: Add random txn's from mempool to GETBLOCKTXN",
          "body": "As compact block completion works currently, nodes reveal precisely the subset of transactions from published blocks that they already have in their mempool when they make a `GETBLOCKTXN` request for the transactions that they are missing during compact block relay. The greatest danger here is that nodes will never request their own transactions. Given a \"sufficient number\" of `GETBLOCKTXN`'s from a single peer, it will become possible to identify their wallet addresses with some degree of confidence. \r\n\r\nAssuming that all transactions except for a node's own, have a nonzero probability of not being in the node's mempool when a block is discovered, an attacker with an infinite set of `GETBLOCKTXN`'s from a single peer that reuses a finite number of pubkeys will have 100% confidence about what addresses belong to that peer.\r\n\r\nI am not a statistician, but I am actively trying to see if I can work out how large, and whether the \"sufficient number\" that gives a reasonable degree of confidence about a peer-pubkey correlation is a realistic scenario or not.\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents mempool fingerprinting by randomly adding  ~ 1 in 200 (0.5%) transactions from our mempool to our `GETBLOCKTXN`. Nodes that have less complete mempools (worse connections) will have fewer excess txn's to relay. (Nodes with 50% of block missing from mempool will tend to have about 5 excess transactions requested if there are 2000 txn's in a block) 0.5% is a number I mostly pulled out of thin air but  a maximum impact of 0.5% seems like a reasonable price to pay if the fingerprinting attack described is realistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I ran -reindex and when I checked the wallet balance it was correct. About an hour later I reran wallet-tool.py and the balance was off again. Because they were run sequentially, I was quickly able to find that two unconfirmed change-outs were the missing coins and found them on a block explorer with the correct balance and still unconfirmed.\r\n\r\nI currently have 6 reused addresses in my wallet, most of them but not all currently have the last transaction as unconfirmed.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to suspect that my node is dropping these unconfirmed transactions. I have restarted my yield generator a number of times in the last few days. Perhaps when I do that, it forgets what transactions are pending when I restart the yield generator and if my mempool has dropped them, then it is not aware and it tries to use the same address for the next conjoin, hence causing address reuse.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound right?\r\n\r\nIf so, I expect all my coins to show up properly when they eventually get confirmed but that might be a while since the taker set the fee at 1 sat/vB.",

      "body": "Thanks to @harding for pinging us on this, but: in Joinmarket, we have had a number of user reports (via our Telegram support chat and a couple other places) for the last several weeks (while mempool sizes were trending higher ofc) of missing balance. It seems that it is related to what @morcos has described above here.\r\n\r\nContext: Joinmarket uses an unusual, nowadays (and probably bad!) model for tracking its wallet: starting from a normal BIP84 seed, we are using address imports into a **watch-only** Core wallet and then, to track address usage we use `listaddressgroupings`, then we use `listunspent` on startup to get an up-to-date picture of currently unspent funds, and then during running we are using `listtransactions` to make updates to our JM wallet's \"utxo set\". [Here](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/issues/1465#issuecomment-1499356251) is a description of some of that.\r\n\r\nSo you can see we are keeping track entirely via the wallet RPC calls to Core.\r\n\r\nIn practice in something like Joinmarket you have users on the maker- side that are obviously concerned to see the new funds disappear without the old funds reappearing (because the taker used a low fee). In many cases they are exporting their wallet to another client (e.g. Sparrow) that can \"find\" the funds, I'm not sure if it's because that client accesses external Electrum servers (which might have bigger mempools ofc!), or something else is going on there.\r\n\r\nAlternatively some of them just reconfigured their mempool to be bigger, and reported they could \"rediscover\" the funds that way within Joinmarket itself.\r\n\r\nApologies that the title of the [issue](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/issues/1465#issuecomment-1494996171) refers to \"address reuse\" *as well as* missing balances, so I've linked you to the first part of the thread that focuses only on the missing balance part.\r\n\r\nI think I understand (a) why the problem arises and (b) why it's a problematic thing to solve (the TLDR seems to be that it's tricky to know properly the actual functional state of a utxo which is not currently in mempool. Is the only natural stopgap (prior to things like `testmempoolaccept` described above), to use `abandontransaction`? Or is some strategy of periodic rebroadcast by remembering txs in our application itself, a good idea? ( i suppose that line of thinking resembles the `testmempoolaccept` idea).\r\n\r\n",
