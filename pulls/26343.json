          "title": "p2p: Advertise `NODE_FULL_RBF` and connect to 4 outbound full-rbf peers if `-mempoolfullrbf` is set",
          "body": "`mempoolfullrbf` allows a node to accept replace-by-fee transactions without requiring replaceability signaling. While the replacement transaction is locally accepted, it should be rejected by all your opt-in rbf peers, the default behavior. As such, the odds are low the replacement transaction propagates to miners, unless there are full-rbf transaction-relay paths existent between the node and those miners mempools.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve this issue by enabling the setting of full-rbf transaction-relay link, in both manual and automated fashions. \r\n\r\nThe first commit introduces a `NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE` service flag to advertise support of full-rbf to our peers if [`mempoolfullrbf`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25353) is set to true. From the results of `getpeerinfo` or `getnetworkinfo`, a node operator can find full-rbf peers on the p2p network to which to manually connect to. The service flag bit select is the 26th one to be compatible with previous full-rbf [experiences](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-June/020570.html).\r\n\r\nThe second commit introduces a `ConnectionType::FULLRBF` if `mempoolfullrbf` is set to true. In `ThreadOpenConnections`, we attempt to keep opened at least 4 outbound full-rbf transaction-relay peer. An outbound full-rbf relay peer is considered as one signaling `NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE` service flag.\r\n\r\nI think if we have concerns on the network-wise resources consumption from those new outbound full-rbf relay peers, we could deduce them `MAX_ADNNODE_CONNECTIONS`. It should be weighted if we have other concerns about the implications on transaction-relay topology robustness or any spying peers flagging themselves as `NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE` to attract early full-rbf traffic. What else ?\r\n\r\nI don't hold to the approach re-using the current automatic connection logic in `ThreadOpenConnections`, if there are others ones I'm interested to consider them. I can split the PR in two, if automatic connection requires more thinking.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- add functional tests\r\n- make `MAX_FULLRBF_RELAY_CONNECTIONS` configurable up to `MAX_ADDNODE_CONNECTIONS` ?\r\n- make automatic connection its own boolean setting ?",

      "body": "> `MayHaveUsefulAddressDB` makes me think we that we are assuming nodes signaling `NODE_NETWORK` or `NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED` to have a useful addr db.\r\n\r\nInteresting! I guess we could leave `ExpectServicesFromConn` as is but check for `MayHaveUsefulAddressDB()` instead of `HasAllDesirableServiceFlags()` for an AddrFetch connections when deciding whether to accept the peer.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure this would be ideal, for the following reasons:\r\n- `MayHaveUsefulAddressDB` is used to decide whether we want to [connect to a feeler](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fabc0310480b49e159a15d494525c5aa15072cba/src/net.cpp#L1834), and whether to [process a received addr](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fabc0310480b49e159a15d494525c5aa15072cba/src/net_processing.cpp#L3606) at all. In neither of these situations we particularly care about the peer's address db (we don't even request addrs from feelers), we care whether it is a (pruned or not) full node, so the function might better be named `IsFullNode()`.\r\n- `MayHaveUsefulAddressDB` just makes the assumption that SPV clients don't know about address relay when they can't serve blocks - that may be the case for most current software, but I don't see why a SPV node shouldn't implement addr relay.\r\n- When we do an AddrFetch connection, we usually don't have a bunch of alternative addrs (otherwise there would be no need to make such a connection in the first place) - we either manually specified this peer (`-seednode`), it's a peer a DNS seed resolves to, or (if #26114 makes it in) it's a fixed seed. When we do make an AddrFetch connection and the peer doesn't deliver addrs, we disconnect them after a few minutes. So I can't see the hurt in trying, even if the service bits don't match, if we don't have a better alternative.",

This increases privacy and will also make it harder to perform fingerprinting attacks (connecting our identities over different networks).\r\n\r\nManual Block-Relay connections:\r\n- can be specified with `-addnode` RPC, both with the `add` and `onetry` command\r\n- can be specified with the `-addnode` bitcoind arg (or in bitcoin.conf) with `<IP>=manual-block-relay`\r\n- don't participate in transaction and address relay\r\n- don't get discouraged / punished for misbehavior (but will still get disconnected for sending TX/tx-INV as automatic block-relay-only peers do)\r\n- are not subject to outbound eviction logic (unlike automatic block-relay-only-peers)\r\n",
