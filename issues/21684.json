    "body": "In many places we use `bool` parameters to denote some effect.\r\n\r\nI suggest that throughout the codebase, we make an effort to (where feasible/touched) replace these with enum class.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit more verbose, but it's already a norm to do `f(/* confusing bool */ true)`, and it would be nice if our compiler helped us out.\r\n\r\nFurther, it makes it easier should later code extend the functionality to add more/different options.\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce clutter we could make a macro `BoolEnum(Argument, EnabledName, DisabledName)`\r\n\r\nNot high importance, so I don't think we should make a project out of it, but I was looking at some code recently where it would have been nice.\r\n\r\nCon: we don't need more structs.",

This can happen inadvertently and the compiler won't catch it. Worst is going from a bool to an integer where -1, 0, >0 has meaning.\r\n\r\nI don't think getting too paranoid about this matters much, but just demonstrates that there are some other niceties in refactoring.",
