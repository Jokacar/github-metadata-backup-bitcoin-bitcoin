    "title": "getblockchaininfo `verificationprogress` never reaches 1.0",
    "body": "In the output of `bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo`, `verificationprogress` sometimes never reaches 1.0, and fluctuates around 0.99999.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"verificationprogress\": 0.9999945316157191,\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was reported in #26433, and closed because `verificationprogress` is only an estimate. I would have commented in that issue, but it's locked. The rationale for closing the issue was because the OP in the issue wanted to use `verificationprogress` to check if the chain is synced, and the field is only an estimate, and shouldn't be relied on as exact.\r\n\r\nThis makes sense, however, however, I think it still should be fixed so that, at the chain tip, `verificationprogress` is 1.0, just for UX reasons. Many a time I've looked at the output of `getblockchaininfo` and been confused because it isn't at 1.0.",
