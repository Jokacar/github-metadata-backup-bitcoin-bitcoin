    "body": "Make negating options the same as not setting them for `-norpcwhitelist`, `-norpcallowip`, `-norpcbind`, `-nobind`, `-nowhitebind`, `-noexternalip`, `-noonlynet`, `-noseednode`, `-nosignetchallenge`, `-nosignetseednode`, `-notest`, and `-norpcwallet` options, instead of triggering confusing side effects and errors, like `-norpcwallet` trying to make RPC calls to the \"0\" wallet.\r\n\r\nThe first 3 commits just clean up code without changing behavior: adding tests and documentation and clarifying code. \r\n\r\nThe last 2 commits change handling of negated options to avoid nonsensical behavior. The idea is to treat most negated options the same as unspecified options by avoiding or working around `IsArgSet()` calls which return false for unspecified options but true for negated ones. The specific changes are described in the commit messages.\r\n\r\nThese changes were originally part of #17783, which adds enforcement that `IsArgSet()` cannot be called on list options, so similar problems do not happen in the future. But progress on #17783 was slower than expected, so it seems good to improve current behavior and documentation while stricter checking is being worked on in #17783.",

Definitely agree it would be a mistake to change `-noconnect` behavior, so I'll revert those changes and add comments to code to clarify the intent. Will also look into why `feature_config_args.py` test didn't catch this since it is testing `-noconnect` explicitly.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30529#pullrequestreview-2201953036\r\n\r\n> but why is changing `IsArgSet()` behavior not an option, instead of telling people not to use it anymore? Are there many spots that rely on it returning `true` in connection with a negated arg?\r\n\r\nI don't think there is something wrong with `IsArgSet()` behavior. The function is doing what you'd expect it to do, but the it's just not a very useful function to call in most cases compared to alternatives. I think we could actually eliminate it pretty easily but did not want to expand the scope of this PR.",

But before\nthis change, negating these options wouldn't fully reset them, and would cause\nside effects interacting with other parameters (listed below). Now, negating\nthese options behaves the same as not setting them at all.\n\nThe code change in this commit is just to avoid using IsArgSet() and GetArgs()\ntogether on the same options. Using IsArgSet() and GetArgs() together\nfrequently leads to bugs because it overlooks the case where an argument is\nnegated and IsArgSet() returns true while GetArgs() returns an empty list. It\nalmost always makes sense to call GetArgs(\"-option\").empty() instead\nIsArgSet(\"-option\") for list options that are allowed to be called multiple\ntimes.\n\nThis change includes release notes, but the release notes don't go into details\nabout specific options. For reference this change:\n\n- Treats specifying -norpcwhitelist exactly the same as not specifying any\n  -rpcwhitelist, instead of behaving almost the same but flipping the default\n  -rpcwhitelistdefault value.\n\n- Treats specifying -norpcallowip and -norpcbind exactly the same as not\n  specifying -rpcallowip or -rpcbind, instead of failing to bind to localhost\n  and failing to show warnings when one value is set without the other.\n\n- Treats specifying -nobind, and -nowhitebind exactly the same as not\n  specifying -bind and -whitebind values instead of causing them to soft-set\n  -listen=1.\n\n- Treats specifying -noexternalip exactly the same as not specifying any\n  -externalip, instead of treating it almost the same but interacting with the\n  -discover value.\n\n- Treats specifying -noonlynet exactly the same as not specifying -onlynet\n  instead of marking all networks unreachable.\n\n- Treats specifying -noseednode exactly the same as not specifying any\n   -seednode value, instead of enabling seed node timeout and log messages\n\n- Treats specifying -nosignetchallenge exactly the same as not specifying\n  -signetchallenge instead of throwing strange error \"-signetchallenge cannot\n  be multiple values\"\n\n- Treats specifying -notest exactly the same as not specifying any\n  -test value, instead of complaining that it must be used with -regtest.",
