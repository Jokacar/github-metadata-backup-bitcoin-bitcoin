    "body": "The Mining interface is designed with Stratum v2 in mind, and can likely also be used to incrementally improve Statum \"v1\" applications.\r\n\r\nOcean recently announced [DATUM](https://ocean.xyz/docs/datum). So far it's proprietary and undocumented, but hopefully that changes. It could be a good test for the generality of the Mining interface to see if the DATUM gateway requires any additional methods.\r\n\r\nHere's the current interface:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d812cf11896a2214467b6fa72d7b763bac6077c5/src/interfaces/mining.h#L47-L106\r\n\r\nWhere `createNewBlock` returns:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d812cf11896a2214467b6fa72d7b763bac6077c5/src/interfaces/mining.h#L30-L45\r\n\r\nAdditionally #30955 proposes to add `getCoinbaseMerklePath()` and `submitSolution()`, and https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/52 proposes to add `waitFeesChanged`.\r\n\r\ncc @luke-jr ",

      "body": "From casual reading of the [DATUM Gateway README](https://github.com/OCEAN-xyz/datum_gateway) (since there's still no spec), the Mining interface could be useful in a few places:\r\n\r\n1. No need to tell users to manually set `-blockmaxsize` and `-blockmaxweight`, because `createNewBlock()` can pass a custom coinbase weight reservation through its `BlockCreateOptions` argument. On a related note, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31384#issuecomment-2530503262 discusses the idea of adding `-maxcoinbaseweight`, and the README suggests Knots will do something similar.\r\n\r\n2. No need to use `-blocknotify` (which launches `datum_gateway` and presumable then calls `getblocktemplate`). Instead `datum_gateway` could run as a deamon and call `waitTipChanged()` and `waitNext()` https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31283 which return when there's a new block or better fees. Also easier to setup between two machines.\r\n\r\nLooking at the \"Template/Share Requirements for Pooled Mining\" I don't see any blocking issues at first glance.\r\n\r\n> Must include generation transaction outputs provided by the pool in the order provided\r\n\r\n> Must include the primary coinbase tag as provided by the pool\r\n\r\n> Must include the unique identifier provided by the pool\r\n\r\nI'm assuming the `datum_gateway` adds these to the template? (since `getblocktemplate` doesn't include a coinbase transaction)",
