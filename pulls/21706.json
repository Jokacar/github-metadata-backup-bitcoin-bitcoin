All logs from any other location will also be dropped during the suppression period. After ~one hour logging restarts and a message with a report on which locations have been suppressed is printed to the log.\r\n\r\nThe key difference to #21603 is that logging is suppressed globally instead of \"per source location\" when at least one source location is logging excessively. \r\n\r\nApproach review is probably the best next step to determine which of the two PRs to move forward with.",

          "title": "log: Mitigate disk filling attacks by rate limiting LogPrintf",
          "body": "This picks up #19995 in an attempt to solve #21559.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to mitigate disk filling attacks by temporarily rate limiting `LogPrintf(…)`.\r\n\r\nA disk fill attack is an attack where an untrusted party (such as a peer) is able to cheaply make your node log to disk excessively. The excessive logging may fill your disk and thus make your node crash either cleanly (best case: if disk fill rate is relatively slow) or uncleanly (worst case: if disk fill rate is relatively fast).\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n\r\nThe hourly logging quota is set **per source location**. Every single source location (say net_processing.cpp:418) gets a quota of 1 MB of logging per hour. Logging is only dropped from source locations that exceed the quota.\r\n\r\n- Only logging to disk is rate limited. Logging to console is not rate limited.\r\n- Only `LogPrintf(…)` is rate limited. `LogPrint(category, …)` (`-debug`) is not rate limited.\r\n- `UpdateTip: new best=[…]` is logged using `LogPrintfWithoutRateLimiting(…)` to avoid rate limiting. High log volume is expected for that source location during IBD.\r\n- When logging is restarted a tally of how many messages/bytes were dropped is printed.\r\n- Log rate limiting can be disabled with the `-ratelimitlogging` config option.\r\n- All logs will be prefixed with `[*]` if there is at least one source location that is currently being suppressed.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\nIn a recent [PR Review Club meeting](https://bitcoincore.reviews/21603) we discussed this PR and evaluated alternative approaches.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Global rate limiting </summary>\r\n\r\n#### Global rate limiting\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion around an alternative approach which would be to globally rate limit `LogPrintf(…)`.  This approach was implemented in a competing PR #21706. The main point [1] in favor of global rate limiting is that it could be confusing to have incomplete logs when logs from one source location are dropped but not from others. The main point against global rate limiting is that it opens another attack vector where an attacker could trigger rate limiting and then execute a 2. attack which would then not be document in the logs at all. With regard to the attack vector on the global approach and the overall reviews the two approaches have gotten I have chosen to continue with the approach in this PR. \r\n(To address the concern of [1] i have chosen to prefix all logs with `[*]` if there is at least one source location that is currently being suppressed.)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>logrotate</summary>\r\n\r\n#### logrotate\r\n\r\nLarryRuane brought up [logrotate](https://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate) which can be used on linux to monitor log files and perform actions (delete, compress, send somewhere, etc.) on them when a certain size or point in time is reached. `logrotate` could be used to rate limit log but since we would like log rate limiting to be enabled by default it is not the best solution. Also on windows an alternative would have to be used.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI have a written a unit test which is contained in this PR. (Not the greatest test, it currently does not work on windows thanks to `\\r\\n`. If someone has an idea how to improve the test i would appreciate it)\r\n\r\nFurther more I made a RPC [here](https://github.com/dergoegge/bitcoin/commit/8e6d15d6be06834d1f634f4a54ea646be8bc3491) that can log excessive amounts of \"a\"s from different locations which i have found useful during my own testing.\r\n`bitcoin-cli excessivelog <location (1-5)> <num_bytes>`\r\n\r\n⚠️One thing to note with that rpc is that the rate limiting logic still prints the last message that triggered the limiting to disk, so something like `bitcoin-cli excessivelog 1 536870912` would still log ~512MiB to disk. Logging to console is also never suppressed (unless -printtoconsole=0)  ⚠️\r\n\r\nA simple example to use the rpc:\r\n```bash\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest setmocktime 1\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 1048500 # log just under 1MiB\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 100 # this should get the total amount logged above 1MiB\r\n                                        # and the rate limiting logic should kick in\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest setmocktime 3602 # let 1 hour pass (only works in regtest)\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 100 # this should trigger logging to resume\r\n```\r\n",

Includes a new unittest verifying `g_best_block` behavior (previously untested at the unit level) and various changes necessary for running and testing `ProcessNewBlock()`-like behavior on the background validation chainstate.\r\n\r\nThis changeset introduces a new block index `nStatus` flag called `BLOCK_ASSUMED_VALID`, and it is applied to block index entries that are beneath the UTXO snapshot base block upon snapshot load. Once each block is validated (during async background validation), the flag is removed. This allows us to avoid (ab)using `BLOCK_VALID_*` flags for snapshot chain block entries, and preserves the original meaning of those flags.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR previously incorporated changes to `LoadBlockIndex()` and `RewindBlockIndex()` as noted in Russ' comments below, but once I generated the changes necessary to test the UpdateTip change, I decided to split this changes out into another PR due to the size of this one.",

          "body": "This PR was part of #16115 but reviewers requested that this be made into a separate PR. As explained in #16115, it's useful, maybe even crucial, for support, analysis, and debugging purposes for the configuration arguments to be present in the `debug.log` file, as that may be the only artifact provided to the developer or support team. That PR logs the configuration settings (command-line arguments and `bitcoin.conf` contents) when `bitcoind` starts. But sometime later, the debug log file may be \"rotated\" (a new `debug.log` file started so it doesn't grow unbounded in size) and this information would be lost unless the previous `debug.log` is preserved.\r\n\r\nThis PR re-logs the configuration information when the log rotates, ensuring that the current `debug.log` file contains this information. Reviewers had reservations about the previous approach (which you can see in #16115's discussion thread), so this PR implements this functionality in a simpler and (I believe) much better way.",

This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Original change description\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with assumeutxo, here's a brief summary from [the issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15605) (where any conceptual discussion not specific to this implementation should happen):\r\n\r\n> assumeutxo would be a way to initialize a node using a headers chain and a serialized version of the UTXO state which was generated from another node at some block height. A client making use of this UTXO \"snapshot\" would specify a hash and expect the content of the resulting UTXO set to yield this hash after deserialization. \r\n> \r\n> This would allow users to bootstrap a usable pruned node & wallet far more quickly (and with less disk usage) than waiting for a full initial block download to complete, since we only have to sync blocks between the base of the snapshot and the current network tip. Needless to say this is at expense of accepting a different trust model, though how different this really ends up being from `assumevalid` in effect is worth debate.\r\n\r\nIn short, this is an interesting change because it would allow nodes to get up and running within minutes given a ~3GB file (at time of writing) under an almost identical trust model to assumevalid.\r\n\r\nIn this implementation, I add a few RPC commands: `dumptxoutset` creates a UTXO snapshot and writes it to disk, and `loadtxoutset` intakes a snapshot from disk, constructs and activates chainstate based on it, and continues a from-scratch initial block download in the background for the sole purpose of validating the snapshot. Once the snapshot is validated, we throw away the chainstate used for background validation.\r\n\r\nThe assumeutxo procedure as implemented is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A UTXO snapshot is loaded with the `loadtxoutset <path>` RPC command.\r\n1. A new chainstate (`CChainState`) is initialized using `ChainstateManager::ActivateSnapshot()`:\r\n   1. The serialized UTXO data is read in and various sanity checks are performed, e.g. compare expected coin count, recompute the hash and compare it with assumeutxo hash in source code.\r\n   1. We \"fast forward\" `new_chainstate->m_chain` to have a tip at the base of the snapshot (with or without block data). Lacking block data, we fake the `nTx` counts of the constituent `CBlockIndex` entries.\r\n   1. `LoadChainTip()` is called on the new snapshot and it is installed as our active chainstate.\r\n1. The new assumed-valid chainstate is now our active, and so that enters IBD until it is synced to the network's tip. Presumably the snapshot would be taken relatively close to the current tip but far enough away to avoid meaningful reorgs, say 10,000 blocks deep.\r\n1. Once the active chainstate is out of IBD, our old validation chain continues IBD \"in the background\" while the active chainstate services requests from most of the system.\r\n1. Once the background validation chainstate reaches a height equal the base of the snapshot, we take the hash of its UTXO set and ensure it equals the expected hash based on the snapshot. If the hashes are equivalent, we delete the validation chainstate and move on without event; if they aren't, we log loudly and fall back to the validation chainstate (we should probably just shut down).\r\n\r\nThe implicit assumption is that the background validation chain will always be a subset of the assumed-valid snapshot chain while the latter is active. We don't properly handle reorgs that go deeper than the base of the snapshot.\r\n\r\n### Changes (already merged/outdated)\r\n\r\n![chainstate-beforeafter (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/54435797-a16b0780-4707-11e9-89c3-c90b5686804d.png)\r\n \r\nThe crux of this change is in removing any assumptions in the codebase that there is a single chainstate, i.e. any references to global variables `chainActive`, `pcoinsTip`, et al. need to be replaced with functions that return the relevant chainstate data at that moment in time. This change also takes `CChainState` to its logical conclusion by making it more self-contained - any references to globals like `chainActive` are removed with class-local references (`m_chain`).\r\n\r\nA few minor notes on the implementation:\r\n\r\n- When we attempt to load a wallet with a BestBlock locator lower than the base of a snapshot and the snapshot has not yet been validated, we refuse to load the wallet.\r\n\r\n- For additional notes, see [the new assumeutxo docs](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/blob/utxo-dumpload-compressed/doc/assumeutxo.md).",

This was new behavior since 6a72f26968cf931c985d8d4797b6264274cabd06 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16426 and is not ideal because it stops other wallets and rpcs and the gui from receiving new notifications until after the scan completes.\r\n\r\nThis change is a half-step towards implementing multiwallet scans (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11756), since it provides needed locator and birthday timestamp information to the Chain interface, and it rationalizes locking and event ordering in the startup code. The second half of implementing parallel rescans requires moving the ScanForWalletTransactions implementation (which this PR does not touch) from the wallet to the node.",
