    "title": "Expose addrman size info via RPC ",
    "body": "If #26847 gets merged, addrman will maintain counts of addresses stored on the new & tried tables, broken down by network. This is useful information for monitoring the state of our addrman when we run it with different network configs on mainnet.\r\n\r\nCurrently when running a node, we can get a rough estimate into this information using the cli argument `-addrinfo`. However, this is just an estimate because it uses the RPC endpoint `getnodeaddresses`, which calls through to `Addrman::GetAddr`. Although this logic path skips the addr caching logic we apply for results propagated to the p2p network, it still applies some logic to filter results. For example it removes addresses that meet the `IsTerrible` attributes. It also doesn’t distinguish between the new and tried tables. \r\n\r\nSo, I recommend we expose the raw counts to provide a better picture of addrman’s workings, especially since addrman & network integrations are particularly hard to test via our automated tooling. We can breakdown the counts by network & new vs tried. \r\n\r\nThere are a few different options for how we can expose this information. I expect this feature to primarily be used by bitcoin core contributors or super-users that understand bitcoind’s inner workings. Thus, I suggest we expose it as a new, hidden RPC. That enables exposing the information to devs without having to guarantee a stable RPC interface over future versions. The name of the RPC can be something generic like  `addrmaninfo`, to allow for future extensions for other debugging information. \r\n\r\nFor more historic context around bitcoin cli’s `-addrinfo` and conversation about cli vs RPC, see [#21595](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21595).  If we do end up implementing a new RPC endpoint, we could consider reworking the cli to use these values directly rather than trying to compute them with partial information. \r\n",

          "title": "rpc: Add test-only RPC getaddrmaninfo for new/tried table address count",
          "body": "implements https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26907. split off from #26988 to keep RPC, CLI discussions separate.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new RPC `getaddrmaninfo`which returns the count of addresses in the new/tried table of a node's addrman broken down by network type. This would be useful for users who want to see the distribution of addresses from different networks across new/tried table in the addrman.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n$ getaddrmaninfo\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n{                   (json object) json object with network type as keys\r\n  \"network\" : {     (json object) The network (ipv4, ipv6, onion, i2p, cjdns)\r\n    \"new\" : n,      (numeric) number of addresses in new table\r\n    \"tried\" : n,    (numeric) number of addresses in tried table\r\n    \"total\" : n     (numeric) total number of addresses in both new/tried tables from a network\r\n  },\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### additional context from [original PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26988)\r\n\r\n1. network coverage tests were skipped because there’s a small chance that addresses from different networks could hash to the same bucket and cause count of different network addresses in the tests to fail. see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26988#discussion_r1137596851.\r\n2. #26988 uses this RPC in -addrinfo CLI. Slight preference for keeping the RPC hidden since this info will mostly be useful to only super users. see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26988#discussion_r1173964808.",
