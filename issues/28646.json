Are these bandwidth savings worth the added code complexity?</i>\r\n\r\nThe project has received Concept ACK from many contributors, and no NACKs. I am unlikely to invent a bulletproof argument, so I leave it up to each reviewer to compare the risks and review costs to the benefits.\r\n\r\nI personally think that the added code is pretty straightforward because it communicates with a legacy code through a thin interface (100 LOC in `net_processing.cpp` to collect transactions instead of relaying them immediately, although the reconciliation code is 500 LOC -- excluding comments and minisketch). Hence it is acceptable to pay for the given optimization.\r\n\r\nIf you suggest any experiment that will convince you, I will do my best to execute it.\r\n\r\n</details>",

They will become permanent topics in our weekly IRC meetings so that we can get updates on the progress of each project and determine the next step to move them forward.\r\n\r\nVoting will close at the start of the IRC meeting on October 19th at 14:00 UTC. To vote, please leave a comment containing the three projects from the list below that you would like to be the priority projects. The priority projects will be the three with the most votes.\r\n\r\nVoting is limited to those who are part of the bitcoin github organization. Comments in this issue from those outside of the organization will be ignored, and may be deleted.
