Create a Transaction hash cache to temporarily store the last used hash during the evaluation of a script.\n2. Verify that the ECDSA signature and the ECDSA public key are well-formed before hashing the transaction.\n3. Verify the length of pushed signatures of vin[i].scriptSig in CTransaction::AreInputsStandard() to see if they are long enough.\n   (currently only stack.size() = (unsigned int)nArgsExpected) is tested, but not the actual arguments. )\n\nThe first 2 defense measures must be deployed together. \n",

Such attack would likely be performed by very powerful mining farms (in China?) or profiting from very low cost for energy (in Iceland or from stealing energy resources and not paying any tax, due to some abusive local privileges, or just because they have LOT of money to spend and already have very large BTC portolio to build and run fast massive mining farms, until they are the only remaining one capable with their power to mine all the remaining boins; then they will control the BTC market by emitting/spending their mass of coins when they want, and can then largely influce the trading).\r\n\r\nThis is then a problem of unfair competition in the mining industry (and probably also in the BTC trading: abusers take no risks, all others have to support the increased risks when BTC is suddenly devaluated: abusers can use that to buy again more coins).\r\n",

      "body": "My understanding is that the worst case version of this can only be exploited with a non-standard transaction. On the current network there is no known miner accepting non-standard transactions (probably for exactly the bug described in this issue and others). While it may be possible to reduce the time needed to verify some of such crafted transactions with caching, implementing that is non-trivial and fixing the overall issue is to the best of my knowledge impossible without a consensus change. Such a network-wide consensus changes first need to be proposed and discussed with the greater community, for example on the `bitcoin-dev` mailing list. Also, it needs a BIP to be implemented in Bitcoin Core and other software that connects to the bitcoin P2P network. So I am closing this issue for now.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I am not saying that the issue doesn't exist. The issue is real, but there is likely no trivial fix other than a consensus change. Something like \"The great consensus cleanup\" could be used as a baseline: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/7f9670b643b7c943a0cc6d2197d3eabe661050c2/bip-XXXX.mediawiki ",

          "body": "To characterize a transaction as standard or non-standard, Bitcoin Core tries to estimate the number of signature checks a particular script can potentially request. A maximum of 15 signature checks is allowed. The function GetSigopCount() \r\n counts the maximum number of signature checks performed by a script.\r\nFor each CHECKSIG or CHECKSIGVERIFY found in a script, one is added to the signature check counter. For multisigs, the maximum number of checks depends on the number of signatories. When CHECKMULTISIG is executed, this number is at the top of the stack. However, to avoid executing the script to obtain the top of the stack value, Bitcoin Core performs an estimation based on static analysis of the script, which returns only an upper bound. This is what GetSigOpCount(true) does. However, the static analysis is very rudimentary, and it overestimates the signature checks for certain common scripts.\r\n\r\n**How GetSigOpCount() works**\r\n\r\nGetSigOpCount() assumes that the number of signers is pushed into the stack immediately before the CHECKMULTISIG opcode. If the previous opcode is not a push opcode, then this function assumes the worst case for each CHECKMULTISIG found, which is 20 signatures (defined by MAX_PUBKEYS_PER_MULTISIG). The problem is that this constant is greater than the maximum number of checks allowed per P2SH redeem script, which means that any P2SH script that uses CHECKMULTISIG must specify the number of signers with a PUSH opcode right before.   \r\n\r\n**The bug in the RSK sidechain**\r\n\r\nTo add a time-locked emergency multisig to RSK powpeg, the RSK community, with the help of RSK core developers, migrated the multisig script that holds the funds of the peg from a traditional P2SH multisig to the following transaction redeem script:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOP_NOTIF \r\n\tOP_PUSHNUM_M\r\n\tOP_PUSHBYTES_33 pubkey1\r\n\t...\r\n\tOP_PUSHBYTES_33 pubkeyN\r\n\tOP_PUSHNUM_N \r\nOP_ELSE \r\n\tOP_PUSHBYTES_3 <time-lock-value>\r\n\tOP_CSV \r\n\tOP_DROP \r\n\tOP_PUSHNUM_3 \r\n\tOP_PUSHBYTES_33 emergencyPubkey1\r\n\t…\r\n\tOP_PUSHBYTES_33 emergencyPubkey4\r\n\tOP_PUSHNUM_4 \r\nOP_ENDIF \r\nOP_CHECKMULTISIG\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe see that there are two script paths and, to reduce the script size, a single CHECKMULTISIG is used for the two paths, separating the signer count from the CHECKMULTISIG opcode. This script worked on testnet, because it lacks the standard checks performed in Mainnet. \r\nThe Liquid sidechain uses a very similar script, but using segwit addresses. \r\n\r\nWe can see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d492dc1cdaabdc52b0766bf4cba4bd73178325d0/src/script/script.cpp#L153) that GetSigOpCount() will find that END_IF is not a push opcode and will assume the number of signature checks is MAX_PUBKEYS_PER_MULTISIG.\r\n\r\n**Motivation for Changing Bitcoin's standard rules**\r\n\r\nSince having two execution paths for two different multisigs, one of them usually time-locked, is a very common use case, Bitcoin users can benefit from relaxing the standard rule and making two-paths multisigs standard.\r\nThe alternate way of having two-paths multisigs is by adding the CHECKMULTISIG at the end of every path. However, this reduces the maximum number of functionaries of the first (non time-locked) multisig, since the sum of both must be below 15.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit is that this change separates the new GetStandardSigOpCount() function used for standard rules from the old GetSigOpCount() method that is used in consensus code (both with fAccurate==true and fAccurate=false). This is very important because consensus rules should not be mixed with non-consensus rules in a dangerous way, as it is today.\r\n\r\nAn additional benefit for the RSK community is that if Bitcoin Core implements this improvement, the RSK community avoids preparing and activating a hard-fork to unblock the funds in the peg.\r\n\r\nI include additional unit tests to show that:\r\n\r\n* Only a single level of nesting is supported. \"IF ELSE ENDIF CHECKMULTISIG\" is supported but \"IF IF ENDIF ENDIF CHECKMULTISIG\" is not supported. \r\n* There must be only two paths (IF ELSE ELSE ELSE ENDIF CHECKMULTISIG\" not supported).\r\n* The change does not affect any other script standard rules, apart from the two-paths multisig.\r\n* The change does not modify consensus rules.\r\n",
