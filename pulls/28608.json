Not locking cs_main while validating assumeutxo snapshots, so the node is responsive when the background chainstate download finishes.\r\n2. Deleting the background chainstate right away when it is no longer needed, instead of waiting until the next restart, which takes up extra disk space and slows down the next startup.",

Followup PR [#25722](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25722) uses it more broadly to return errors and warnings from wallet loading functions as well.\r\n\r\nThis change adds two major features to the result class:\r\n\r\n- For better error handling, adds the ability to return a value on failure, not just a value on success. This is a key missing feature that makes the result class not useful for functions like `LoadChainstate()` which produce different errors that need to be handled differently [^1].\r\n\r\n[^1]: Ability to return error values was actually present in the original implementation of [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218), but unfortunately removed in later iterations.\r\n\r\n- For better error reporting, adds the ability to return warning messages and multiple errors, not just a single error string. This provides a way for functions to report errors and warnings in a standard way, and simplifies interfaces:\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -virtual std::unique_ptr<Wallet> loadWallet(const std::string& name, bilingual_str& error, std::vector<bilingual_str>& warnings) = 0;\r\n    +virtual util::Result<std::unique_ptr<Wallet>> loadWallet(const std::string& name) = 0;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options, DatabaseStatus& status, bilingual_str& error);\r\n    +util::Result<std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase>, DatabaseError> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options);\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThis change also makes some more minor improvements:\r\n\r\n- Smaller type size. `util::Result<int>` is 16 bytes, and `util::Result<void>` is 8 bytes. Previously both were 72 bytes.\r\n\r\n- Broader type compatibility. Supports noncopyable and nonmovable success and error types.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives & design notes\r\n\r\nThe main goal for the `util::Result` class is to provide a standard way for functions to report error and warnings strings. The interface tries to make it easy to provide detailed error feedback to end users, without cluttering code or making it harder to return other result information. There have been multiple iterations of the design using different internal representations and providing different capabilities:\r\n\r\n|   | Representation (approximate)                   | Notes |\r\n|---|------------------------------------------------|-------|\r\n| _1_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Original #25218 implementation in da98fd2efc1a6b9c6e876cf3e227a8c2e9a10827. Good capabilities, but larger type size. Supports error standardized error reporting and customized error handling with failure values. |\r\n| _2_ | `variant<T,bilingual_str>`                | Final #25218 implementation in 7a45c33d1f8a758850cf8e7bd6ad508939ba5c0d. No support for returning failure values so not useful in many cases.\r\n| _3_ | `variant<monostate,T,F>`                 | Pending #25601 implementation that allows choosing whether to use standardized error reporting or return custom failure values, but doesn't support having both at the same time, like approaches _(1)_, _(4)_, _(5)_, _(6)_ do. |\r\n | _4_ | `tuple<variant<T,F>,bilingual_str>`      | Original #25608 implementation in c29d3008de9314dd463ed08e8bff39fe55324498. Basically the same as _(1)_ except it uses separate success and failure types instead of the same type. Using separate success and failure types makes the result class a little less flexible but can help avoid some ambiguity and inconsistent result states. |\r\n| _5_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Final #25608 implementation in dd91f294206ac87b213d23bb76656a0a5f0f4781. Essentially the same as original implementation _(1)_ except has some usability improvements. |\r\n| _6_ | `tuple<T,unique_ptr<tuple<F,bilingual_str>>` | Pending #25665 implementation (this PR). Supports returning failure values, uses separate success and failure types to avoid ambiguity, uses `unique_ptr` to reduce result type size, and avoids heap allocation in the happy path. |\r\n\r\n### Prior discussions & history\r\n\r\n- _furszy_ introduced a `BResult` class providing a standard error reporting mechanism in [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218). It was renamed to `util::Result` in [#25721](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25721) but kept the same representation and capabilities.\r\n\r\n- _MarcoFalke_ suggested using `BResult` for the `LoadChainstate` function in [#25308 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25308#issuecomment-1181674645). Inability to use `BResult` there due to lack of support for failure values led to initial work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _w0xlt_ wrote a `StructuredResult` class in [#25308](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25601) adding the ability to return failure values but sacrificing standard error reporting, which led to more work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _martinus_ suggested a space optimization in [#25608 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608#discussion_r921049409) that also made it easier to support distinct failure & success types, leading to [#25665](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665) as a replacement for [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).",

This PR makes the wallet UI safer by not rendering transactions as fully confirmed until the background validation is done.\r\n\r\nInstead it shows the same icon as when a transaction has 1 confirmation. This is quite conservative. The cost of tricking someone into accepting a fake coin, by giving them a invalid snapshot`*` and then mining a block on top of it, is higher than a regular doublespend by mining.\r\n\r\n![pending](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/10217/a2a95190-a1a7-402e-822b-b0829d5bdf45)\r\n\r\n`* =` in the current implementation this involves giving someone a malicious binary or getting them to recompile\r\n\r\nCaveat: because transaction state is updated after `blockConnected`, if you restart the node during background sync, then the transaction will show as fully confirmed (`\"assumed\": false`) briefly - until the next block is connected.",

          "body": "- Background and FAQ: https://github.com/jamesob/assumeutxo-docs/tree/2019-04-proposal/proposal\r\n- Prior progress/project: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/11\r\n- Replaces https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606, which was closed due to Github slowness. Original description and commentary can be found there.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis changeset finishes the first phase of the assumeutxo project. It makes UTXO snapshots loadable via RPC (`loadtxoutset`) and adds `assumeutxo` parameters to chainparams. It contains all the remaining changes necessary to both use an assumedvalid snapshot chainstate and do a full validation sync in the background.\r\n\r\nThis may look like a lot to review, but note that\r\n- ~200 lines are a (non-essential) demo shell script\r\n- Many lines are functional test, documentation, and relatively dilute RPC code.\r\n\r\nSo it shouldn't be as burdensome to review as the linecount might suggest.\r\n\r\n- **P2P**: minor changes are made to `init.cpp` and `net_processing.cpp` to make simultaneous IBD across multiple chainstates work.\r\n- **Pruning**: implement correct pruning behavior when using a background chainstate\r\n- **Blockfile separation**: to prevent \"fragmentation\" in blockfile storage, have background chainstates use separate blockfiles from active snapshot chainstates to avoid interleaving heights and impairing pruning.\r\n- **Indexing**: some `CValidationInterface` events are given with an additional parameter, ChainstateRole, and all indexers ignore events from ChainstateRole::ASSUMEDVALID so that indexation only happens sequentially.\r\n- Have `-reindex` properly wipe snapshot chainstates.\r\n- **RPC**: introduce RPC commands `loadtxoutset` and (hidden) `getchainstates`.\r\n- **Release docs & first assumeutxo commitment**: add notes and a particular assumeutxo hash value for first AU-enabled release.\r\n  - This will complete the project and allow use of UTXO snapshots for faster node bootstrap.\r\n\r\nThe next phase, if it were to be pursued, would be coming up with a way to distribute the UTXO snapshots over the P2P network.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### UTXO snapshots\r\n\r\nCreate your own with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh`, e.g. \r\n```shell\r\n./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh 788000 utxo.dat ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$(pwd)/testdata`)\r\n```\r\nor use the pre-generated ones listed below.\r\n\r\n- Testnet: **2'500'000** (Sjors):\r\n  - torrent: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:511e09f4bf853aefab00de5c070b1e031f0ecbe9&dn=utxo-testnet-2500000.dat&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl%3A6969`\r\n  - sha256: `79db4b025448cc0ac388d8589a28eab02de53055d181e34eb47391717aa16388`\r\n- Signet: **160'000** (Sjors):\r\n  - torrent: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:9da986cb27b3980ea7fd06b21e199b148d486880&dn=utxo-signet-160000.dat&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl%3A6969`\r\n  - sha256: `eeeca845385ba91e84ef58c09d38f98f246a24feadaad57fe1e5874f3f92ef8c`\r\n- Mainnet: **800'000** (Sjors):\r\n  - Note: this needs the following commit cherry-picked in: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/commit/24deb2022b822f22fba9fcbee201e37a83225eb2\r\n  - torrent: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:50ee955bef37f5ec3e5b0df4cf0288af3d715a2e&dn=utxo-800000.dat&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl%3A6969`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### For fun (~5min)\r\n\r\nIf you want to do a quick test, you can run `./contrib/devtools/test_utxo_snapshots.sh` and follow the instructions. This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob assumeutxo\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/assumeutxo\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.",

At this point in time, code nits probably aren't going to be useful either.\r\n\r\nThis draft has been posted to provide a tangible example of a softfork we might pursue, and a representation of the necessary code changes.\r\n\r\n### Activation method and parameters\r\n\r\nSpecific activation parameters have not been specified here (or are marked FIXME) to avoid putting the consensus cart before the horse. The activation method here has defaulted to the one used for BIP-0341 and might change pending discussion.",

          "body": "This change drops `shutdown.h` and `shutdown.cpp` files, replacing them with a `NodeContext::shutdown` member which is used to trigger shutdowns directly. This gets rid of an unnecessary layer of indirection, and allows getting rid of the `kernel::g_context` global.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR tries to improve error handling of `SignalInterrupt` code by marking relevant methods `[[nodiscard]]` to avoid the possibility of uncaught exceptions mentioned https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27861#discussion_r1255496707.\r\n\r\nBehavior is changing In a few cases which are noted in individual commit messages. Particularly: GUI code more consistently interrupts RPCs when it is shutting down, shutdown state no longer persists between unit tests, the stop RPC now returns an RPC error if requesting shutdown fails instead of aborting, and other failed shutdown calls now log errors instead of aborting.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a net reduction in lines of code, but in some cases the explicit error handling and lack of global shutdown functions do make it more verbose. The verbosity can be seen as good thing if it discourages more code from directly triggering shutdowns, and instead encourages code to return errors or send notifications that could be translated into shutdowns. Probably a number of existing shutdown calls could just be replaced by better error handling.",

As a result, the fee estimator would block mempool's `cs` until it finished updating every time a new block was connected.\r\nInstead of being blocked only on mempool tx removal, we were blocking on both tx removal and fee estimator updating.\r\nIf we want to further improve fee estimation, or add heavy-calulation steps to it, it is currently not viable as we would be slowing down block relay in the process\r\n\r\nThis PR is smaller in terms of the changes made compared to #11775, as it focuses solely on enabling fee estimator updates from the validationInterface/cscheduler thread notifications.\r\n\r\nI have not split the validation interface because, as I understand it, the rationale behind the split in #11775 was to have `MempoolInterface` signals come from the mempool and `CValidationInterface` events come from validation. I believe this separation can be achieved in a separate refactoring PR when the need arises.\r\n\r\nAlso left out some commits from #11775\r\n- Some refactoring which are no longer needed.\r\n- Handle reorgs much better in fee estimator. \r\n- Track witness hash malleation in fee estimator \r\n\r\nI believe they are a separate change that can come in a follow-up after this.\r\n\r\n",

This requires a mutex to protect chainstates from being deleted while they are in use, so I added a simple `m_chainstates_mutex` to guard the `m_chainstates` vector, but this has snowballed into a much bigger change because of lock ordering conflicts. Some parts of the code like `Chainstate::ActivateBestChain` need to lock `m_chainstates_mutex` before `cs_main` so `cs_main` can be released to let notifications be processed. But most code wants to lock `cs_main` first, and only needs to access `ChainstateManager` object briefly to get a reference to the active chain, so it more naturally locks `cs_main` before `m_chainstates_mutex`. I was able to make cleanups in validation.cpp, moving things between `Chainstate` and `ChainstateManager` to acquire `m_chainstates_mutex` before `cs_main`, or relying on `Chainstate` members and avoiding the need to lock `m_chainstates_mutex` at all, and I think these changes are good, but after doing this (3b5c646790c55c01c318bce7d029a8d9e67147bc) it turns out the lock order inconsistency is much worse in net_processing than validation, and it would not be good for performance or code complexity to try lock `m_chainstates_mutex` before `cs_main` there.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of taking a different approach of using a shared mutex instead of an exclusive mutex to protect access to `Chainstate` instances and prevent them from being deleted while in use. Then code could freely obtain shared locks to `m_chainstates_mutex` and exclusive locks to `cs_main` in either order. In order to prevent deadlocks, the small amount of code that creates and deletes chainstates and needs exclusive access to both locks would just need to be careful to acquire both locks atomically and never hold one exclusive lock while it is waiting for the other. This idea is conceptually pretty simple, and it could introduce support for shared locking that could be useful in other contexts. But I'm not exactly sure what approach to take with the implementation, and I'm worried it may run into problems with compiler thread safety analysis. I'm also wondering if it might make sense to pause working on locking and instead work on splitting up the current PR into commits to make it more reviewable.",

A test which\nsubmits a block like this and previously crashed the node has been added in\nfeature_assumeutxo.py. It was written and posted by maflcko in\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29261#issuecomment-1918947945\n\nCompatibility note: This change could result in -checkblockindex failures if a\nsnapshot was loaded by a previous version of Bitcoin Core and not fully\nvalidated, because fake nTx values will have been saved to the block index. It\nwould be pretty easy to avoid these failures by adding some compatibility code\nto `LoadBlockIndex` and changing `nTx` values from 1 to 0 when they are fake\n(when `(pindex->nStatus & BLOCK_VALID_MASK) < BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS`), but a\nlittle simpler not to worry about being compatible in this case.\n\nCo-authored-by: MarcoFalke <*~=`'#}+{/-|&$^_@721217.xyz>",

          "body": "Improve new LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(),  LogWarning(), LogError() macros introduced in #28318:\r\n\r\n- Make them consistent, now all accepting the same parameters.\r\n- Make them all accept log categories, to make it possible to filter or highlight log messages from a particular component.\r\n- Make them compatible with wallet logging, which includes the wallet name in log messages.\r\n- Make them not rely on a global LogInstance, to provide better control of logging in controlled environments, such as unit tests that want to selectively capture log output, or libbitcoinkernel applications that want to have multiple instances of validation objects without mixing their log output.\r\n- Make them less verbose by not requiring category constants to be specified in individual log prints.\r\n\r\nAn [overview](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0cd1616d47e61e125eb3e573573c0c56fba6b775/src/logging.h#L293-L332) of the macros can be found in the logging header.\r\n\r\n### Problems this PR attempts to solve\r\n\r\nThe new log macros in introduced #28318 are generally great. They allow writing code that is succinct and clear, and make it a lot easier to figure out what log levels are being used. Unfortunately, the new macros are slightly less general than than needed to be used throughout the codebase. Particularly:\r\n\r\n1. The new macros cannot be used conveniently in wallet code because wallet log prints are supposed to automatically attach wallet names to log messages.\r\n2. The new macros cannot be used in libbitcoinkernel code because they do not allow specifying a logger instance.\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, the only alternative approach to solving these problems would be to reimplement these macros outside the logging framework so they could be used by wallet and validation code. This PR just takes the approach of slightly generalizing these macros so they work everywhere.\r\n\r\n### Note to reviewers\r\n\r\nI'd encourage looking at the description and code changes in this PR to evaluate it and try to come an independent judgement before looking at the discussion history. Unfortunately and regrettably, I made some dismissive comments on the previous PR, so the discussion here starts out immediately heated.\r\n\r\nA summary of the disagreement is that ajtowns believes allowing log syntax `LogDebug(m_log, \"debug message\\n\")` is [harmful](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29256#issuecomment-2085586513) if log category is part of the `m_log` argument instead of being an explicit category constant. I think omitting the explicit category constant is not a big deal, cuts down on verbosity and repetition, and allows important features like logging to different instances, and automatically adding other metadata (like wallet filenames) to log messages. Other parts of the discussion refer to earlier versions of the PR, go down various tangents, and make the argument that this PR is unnecessary, not that it is harmful.",

          "body": "By defining a virtual interface class for the scheduler client, users of the kernel can now define their own event consuming infrastructure, without having to spawn threads or rely on the scheduler design.\r\n\r\nRemoving `CScheduler` also allows removing the thread and exception modules from the kernel library. \r\n\r\nTo make the `CMainSignals` class easier to use from a kernel library perspective, remove its global instantiation and adopt RAII practices.\r\n\r\nRenames `CMainSignals` to `ValidationSignals`, which more accurately describes its purpose and scope.\r\n\r\nAlso make the `ValidationSignals` in the `ChainstateManager` and CTxMemPool` optional. This could be useful in the future for using or testing these classes without having to instantiate any form of signal handling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587). It improves the kernel API and removes two modules from the kernel library.",

          "body": "`CheckBlockIndex() ` are consistency checks that are currently enabled by default on regtest.\r\n\r\nThe function is rather slow, which is annoying if you\r\n* attempt to run it on other networks, especially if not fully synced\r\n* want to generate a long chain on regtest and see block generation slow down because you forgot to disable `-checkblockindex` or don't know it existed.\r\n\r\nOne reason why it's slow is that in order to be able to traverse the block tree depth-first from genesis, it inserts pointers to all block indices into a `std::multimap` - for which inserts and lookups become slow once there are hundred thousands of entries.\r\nHowever, typically the block index is mostly chain-like with just a few forks so a multimap isn't really needed for the most part. This PR suggests to store the block indices of the chain ending in the best header in a vector instead, and store only the rest of the indices in a multimap. This does not change the actual consistency checks that are being performed for each index, just the way the block index tree is stored and traversed.\r\n\r\nThis adds a bit of complication to make sure each block is visited (note that there are asserts that check it), making sure that the two containers are traversed correctly, but it speeds up the function considerably:\r\n\r\nOn master, a single invocation of `CheckBlockIndex` takes ~1.4s on mainnet for me (4.9s on testnet which has >2.4 million blocks).\r\nWith this branch, the runtime goes down to ~0.27s (0.85s on testnet).This is a speedup by a factor ~5.",

Instead of needing to be deferenced twice with `**result` or `(*result)->member`, it only needs to be dereferenced once with `*result` or `result->member`. Also when it is used in a boolean context, instead of evaluating to true when there is no error and the pointer is null, it evaluates to false so it is straightforward to determine whether the result points to something.\r\n\r\nThis PR is only partial a solution to #26004 because while it makes it easier to check for null pointer values, it does not make it impossible to return a null pointer value inside a successful result. It would be possible to enforce that successful results always contain non-null pointers by using a `not_null` type (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24423) in combination with `ResultPtr`, though.\r\n",

          "body": "The `PopulateAndValidateSnapshot` function introduced in f6e2da5fb7c6406c37612c838c998078ea8d2252 from #19806 has been setting fake `nTx` and `nChainTx` values that can show up in RPC results (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29328) and make `CBlockIndex` state hard to reason about, because it is difficult to know whether the values are real or fake.\r\n\r\nRevert to previous behavior of setting `nTx` and `nChainTx` to 0 when the values are unknown, instead of faking them. Also drop no-longer needed `BLOCK_ASSUMED_VALID` flag.\r\n\r\nDropping the faked values also fixes assert failures in the `CheckBlockIndex` `(pindex->nChainTx == pindex->nTx + prev_chain_tx)` check that could happen previously if forked or out-of-order blocks before the snapshot got submitted while the snapshot was being validated. The PR includes two commits adding tests for these failures and describing them in detail.\r\n\r\nCompatibility note: This change could cause new `-checkblockindex` failures if a snapshot was loaded by a previous version of Bitcoin Core and not fully validated, because fake `nTx` values will have been saved to the block index. It would be pretty easy to avoid these failures by adding some compatibility code to `LoadBlockIndex` and changing `nTx` values from 1 to 0 when they are fake (when `(pindex->nStatus & BLOCK_VALID_MASK) < BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS`), but a little simpler not to worry about being compatible in this case.",

This internalizes the workflow that was previously done by scripts: roll back the chain to the height we actually want the snapshot from, create the snapshot, roll forward to the real tip again.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about internalizing this functionality is that we can write tests for the code and it gives us more options to make the functionality robust. The shell scripts we have so far will be more cumbersome to maintain in the long run, especially since we will only notice later when we have broken them. I think it's safe to remove these `test_utxo_snapshots.sh` as well when we have this option in `dumptxoutset` because we have also added some good additional functional test coverage for this functionality.",

Obviously let me know if I missed anything.\r\n\r\n## Critical Issues/PRs\r\n\r\n- [x] #29612 (which fixes #25675) - Improves size of dump, critical because it is not backwards compatible\r\n- [ ] #29519 - Stop syncing non-snapshot chain from peers that are already connected\r\n- [x] #29726 - Fix -reindex behavior\r\n- [x] #29370 - Get rid of faked nTx and nChainTx values (closing issues discussed in #29261)\r\n- [ ] #29720 - RPC fixes for missing values, addressing #29328\r\n- [ ] #28553 - The mainnet params themselves\r\n\r\n## Optional Issues/PRs\r\n\r\n(Attempted a rough ordering by importance)\r\n\r\n- [ ] #28616 (which fixes #28598) - Show background chain funds as not fully confirmed in GUI\r\n- [ ] #29553 - `dumptxoutset` with height param\r\n- [x] (obsolete) #28670 - Improved error handling for `loadtxoutset`\r\n- [x] #29478 - Additional test coverage for `loadtxoutset`\r\n- [x] #29617 - Additional test coverage\r\n- [x] #29973 - Additional test coverage\r\n- [ ] #29428 - Additional test coverage\r\n- [ ]  #29996 - Additional test coverage\r\n- [ ] #29993 - Improve usability\r\n- [ ] #28608 (draft) - State and locking cleanup\r\n\r\n## Critical conceptual discussion\r\n\r\n- [ ] Agreement on a rule of thumb which height we choose once there is consensus for mainnet readiness, i.e. how to choose the height for #28553 once we are close to an upcoming release. I think the earlier we discuss this the better, so that this doesn't get in the way later.\r\n\r\n## Optional conceptual discussion\r\n\r\nThese were taken from #28553 and [the original assumeutxo PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27596#issuecomment-1727936044).\r\n\r\n- [ ] Distribution of snapshots - This recently came up [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29551#pullrequestreview-1917416713) and [here](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2024-03-07#1012635;). There are multiple levels to this topic but I believe that this is not critical either way. If it were critical then, at the most basic level, we would probably provide an \"official\" torrent/download link for the dump with the release. It would be great if one or more contributors could do that (@Sjors did this in #28516 for example) and are willing to maintain this for a reasonable amount of time but it is not critical IMO because anyone can use `dumptxoutset` to recreate the dump and then share it any way they like. So there is no need to provide this service from within the project. I think anyone who plans to distribute the dump to other users (think of downstream projects like BTCPayServer, Raspiblitz, Umbrel, Greenlight etc.) should validate the dump like this at least once anyway. And there may even be options for distribution possible for downstream projects that we can not even think of right now but if we don't make the feature available they can also not be explored.\r\n- [ ] Usage of MuHash #27669 - While it would be nice to have this I don't think it is blocking because this can still be introduced later without invalidating existing dumps.\r\n- [ ] Make params configurable/not hardcoded params - I think it would be good to stay on the safe side for now and make the feature available to the public as originally planned. If the feature sees wide adoption and requests for more flexibility come in that would be the right point to explore this further.\r\n- [ ] Should old hashes be removed from source code at some point? - Obviously not relevant for the first mainnet params\r\n- [ ] How frequently should we update testnet/signet params and is there any way to deal with the possibility that these chains [may get nuked at some point](https://x.com/kallewoof/status/1763222648367308958)?",

They make `Chainstate` objects self-contained, so for example, it is possible to determine what blocks to connect to a chainstate without querying `ChainstateManager`, and to determine whether a Chainstate is validated without basing it on inferences like `&cs != &ActiveChainstate()` or `GetAll().size() == 1`.\r\n\r\nThe PR also tries to make assumeutxo terminology less confusing, using \"current chainstate\" to refer to the chainstate targeting the current network tip, and \"historical chainstate\" to refer to the chainstate downloading old blocks and validating the assumeutxo snapshot. It removes uses of the terms \"active chainstate,\" \"usable chainstate,\" \"disabled chainstate,\" \"ibd chainstate,\" and \"snapshot chainstate\" which are confusing for various reasons.",
