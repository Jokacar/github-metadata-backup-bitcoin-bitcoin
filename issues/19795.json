    "body": "**Expected behavior**: Disabling DNS seeding (`-dnsseed=0`) should make Bitcoin Core use the fixed seed nodes immediately on startup (assuming an empty `peers.dat`).\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**:  The fixed seed nodes are used but only after an unnecessary 60 second timeout, and a somewhat misleading log message (\"Adding fixed seed nodes as DNS doesn't seem to be available.\").\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**: `rm ~/.bitcoin/peers.dat && src/bitcoind -dnsseed=0` and wait... ðŸ’¤ \r\n\r\nThis issue is probably a \"good first issue\" :)",

When determining whether to use DNS seeds, it will currently see these two peers and decide \"we're connected to the p2p network, so no need to lookup DNS\" -- but block-relay-only peers don't do address relay, so if your address book is full of invalid addresses (apart from your anchors) this behaviour will prevent you from recovering from that situation.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes it so that it only skips use of DNS seeds when there are two full-outbound peers, not just block-relay-only peers.",
