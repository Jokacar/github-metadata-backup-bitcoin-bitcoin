    "body": "To supplement the [ongoing conceptual discussion about a testnet reset](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/9bL00vRj7OU/m/9yCPo3uUBwAJ) I have drafted a move to v4 including a fix to the difficulty adjustment mechanism, which was part of the motivation that started the discussion.\r\n\r\nConceptual considerations:\r\n- The conceptual discussion about doing a testnet4 or softforking the fix into testnet3 is outside of the scope of this PR and I would ask reviewers to contribute their opinions on this on the ML instead. However, I am happy to adapt this PR to a softfork change on testnet3 if there is consensus for that instead.\r\n- The difficulty adjustment fix suggested here touches the `CalculateNextWorkRequired` function and uses the same logic used in `GetNextWorkRequired` to find the last previous block that was not mined with difficulty 1 under the exceptionf. An alternative fix briefly mentioned on the mailing list by Jameson Lopp would be to \"restrict the special testnet minimum difficulty rule so that it can't be triggered on the block right before a difficulty retarget\". That would also fix the issue but I find my suggestion here a bit more elegant.",

      "body": "When resetting a test chain, it is also important to consider the script interpreter coverage of the current chain. Test chains are (usually) the first place to go to, to test new script primitives and protocols, as well as consensus deployments. The existing chain thus serves as a test for consensus implementations, apart from basic unit test vectors. It would be good to think how to preserve the test vectors in the chain. See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11739#issuecomment-346515145 . Or if it is not needed, it would be good to say so. Maybe https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/blob/main/unit_test_data/script_assets_test.json already covers a good portion?\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, testnet is the only public chain where anyone can submit a nonstandard transaction from their laptop. Recall that policy is enforced on all networks equally (see commit e1dc15d69061e69351c72907444e8ded0ac7c88c), so getting a non-mempool transaction into a block is only possible for a miner, or by cooperating with a miner. So if the difficulty hack is removed completely, anyone wishing to submit a transaction would have to go purchase and set up mining hardware, or find a miner willing to accept the transaction. Not saying what is the best approach here, just saying that the effects should be considered and a change be done intentionally.",

I am experimenting with some of the proposals from the mailing list and so I added Andres Poelstra's suggested difficulty adjustment with 6h/1M from here: https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/9bL00vRj7OU/m/kFPaQCzmBwAJ\r\n\r\n> Probably we should support tracking both testnet3 and the new testnet4 for some time. Making the new code conditional on a different chain param that's only set for testnet4 would probably be the easiest way of accomplishing that?\r\n\r\nUpdated the code to introduce T4 (`-testnet4`) and keep T3 in place but give some deprecation warning when it's used. I guess we would keep this in place for 1 or 2 releases and then remove T3 and then let `-testnet` run T4.\r\n\r\nI am using the Genesis block hash to distinguish between the two testnets. There may be cleaner solutions but I think this is ok since it would be only temporary until T3 is removed.\r\n\r\n> Moreover, testnet is the only public chain where anyone can submit a nonstandard transaction from their laptop.\r\n\r\nIs it really realistic that someone with just their CPU would be able to mine a block with their non-standard tx on the current testnet? If the bug isn't active currently they would need to wait for it to become active and that could take weeks, right? And when it becomes active I would imagine the miner who found the first block in the difficulty=1 series just blasts the network and the CPU miner still has no chance to get a block in between. \r\n\r\nWe could revert #28354 for testnet4 if this is a feature that matters to users. Is it too much to ask that people use `testmempoolaccept` or run their own testnet node with `-acceptnonstdtxn=0` when they want to test standardness of their tx? I would say no. And I don't see another option to solve this on layer 1 if we assume nobody changes the defaults.\r\n\r\n> It would be good to think how to preserve the test vectors in the chain.\r\n\r\nInteresting thought. I think once there is consensus to do T4 we will find a creative solution for this. Cool would be to convert this coverage to fuzzing coverage somehow but I am not sure if that's realistic or worth the effort. Otherwise, we could write a program that looks at all the different scripts that exist on T3 and replays them on T4 or if we can compress them somehow like by filtering everything that doesn't add coverage, then we turn it into a unit test that replays the interesting scripts.",

      "body": "Since some people consider the blockstorms an interesting feature of Testnet3, it might be interesting to only raise the difficulty of the delayed block exception to 100,000 instead of 1,000,000. This would allow the network to return to the organic difficulty in fewer difficulty periods and slow down the blockstorms but not remove the feature altogether. My understanding is that this would correspond roughly a tenth of one S9 mining on the network, so if no one had mined for a while, a single S9 could restart the network with ~60 s blocks, but wouldn’t churn out thousands of blocks per second.\r\n\r\nOnly allowing lower difficulty blocks after 6 hours could easily make testnet useless for extended periods, if someone put several ASICs on testnet for a while, it might prevent other users from getting confirmations for up to 6 hours. I could see an increase from the twenty minute rule to maybe an hour, but more seems counter to why the rule was introduced in the first place.",

All you have to do is to set the time +20min and mine a block on your laptop. If you don't want to try it yourself, you can come by to watch it on my laptop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Since some people consider the blockstorms an interesting feature of Testnet3\r\n\r\nAfter a quick chat with @murchandamus, an alternative fix would be to require the pre-retarget block to have the \"correct\" difficulty, so that all retarget periods are organic. The +20min hack would remain to allow a CPU to mine a few blocks, if needed, however, a block storm would be naturally limited by the +120h cut-off rule. This would limit the block storms to small block \"gusts\", which seems good enough to make everyone happy?",

      "body": "> 6 hours seems overkill to me. I'd think 3 hours would suffice, since it would mean that at worst someone would be able to generate a block 1 hour after the previous block if they also warped the time ahead by the max 2 hours.\r\n\r\nThree hours seems too long to me. That would mean that the first use of the low-difficulty loophole would require one hour of wait (by also setting your clock two hours to the future), but any subsequent block would be delayed by three hours. It would be trivial for anyone with a modicum of hashpower to disrupt liveness of testnet for any hashpowerless developers.\r\n\r\nConsidering @jlopp’s demonstration of the downsides of the low-difficulty loophole, and mulling it over a bit more, I would now prefer:\r\n\r\n1. Retain the 20-minute difficulty exception\r\nThis would permit developers to author a new block with at most reasonable delay. While nobody else is doing so, it would be possible to author a new block almost immediately, if someone is already making use of the exception, a wait of twenty minutes would be sufficient to allow another block.\r\n2. Prevent use of the 20-minute difficulty exception on the last block in a difficulty period\r\nThis would mitigate the blockstorms to only short block gusts: if no one else is making use of the exception, a user would be able to issue around six blocks almost instantaneously, but no more.\r\n3. Do not increase the minimum difficulty\r\nRestricting authoring of new block to owners of ASIC equipment just seems unnecessary, if the difficulty reset to minimum difficulty is mitigated.\r\n\r\nObviously, the testnet would still be vulnerable to the [timewarp bug](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/75831/5406), so perhaps testnet4 should include a variant of the proposed rule from the Great Consensus Cleanup that would require the first block of a difficulty period to be no more than two hours less than the previous difficulty period’s last block’s timestamp.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I would be satisfied if using the 20-minute difficulty exception would be changed such that `nBits` could remain at the proper value, and were available for any block in the difficulty period without incurring the difficulty resetting to the minimum. However, my understanding is that the difficulty check in block validation is context independent, and therefore a block would fail if the hash were higher than the `nBits` value in its own header.",

      "body": "I had to rebase to fix a silent merge conflict and I think I managed to make the CI happy with the tests I added. In general, I think this can be moved out of draft status now since we are discussing the details of the changes in parameters but overall there seems to be no opposition to the change. I initially had removed Testnet3 as part of this already and keeping it in place makes this much less controversial/dangerous.\r\n\r\nI have removed the adjustments on min difficulty and changed the exception period back to 20 min. I think keeping this as is seems to be the path that has the most support but if there is consensus on a mild adjustment of the exception period of course I can add this again. Given what was discussed maybe we can agree on 30 min or 1 h but if it's unclear that this is really needed we should probably not change too many things at once.\r\n\r\n> I'd propose the following coinbase string referencing an article published today regarding testnet: \"CCN 02/May/2024 Bitcoin Testnet Could Need Reset\"\r\n\r\nHappy to add this, I considered my genesis block just a placeholder anyway. The only reason we might use something different is if review here drags on for a few months and people would prefer something fresher by then. I will add it in my next push unless other reviewers disagree with the choice.\r\n\r\n> Prevent use of the 20-minute difficulty exception on the last block in a difficulty period\r\n\r\n@murchandamus do you explicitly prefer this over my proposed fix? I find it more elegant and intuitive if we allow the use on all blocks and prevent the adjustment from being affected by it.\r\n\r\n> perhaps testnet4 should include a variant of the proposed rule from the Great Consensus Cleanup that would require the first block of a difficulty period to be no more than two hours less than the previous difficulty period’s last block’s timestamp.\r\n\r\nInteresting, I will try to see how easy it would be to do this.\r\n\r\n> Alternatively, I would be satisfied if using the 20-minute difficulty exception would be changed such that nBits could remain at the proper value, and were available for any block in the difficulty period without incurring the difficulty resetting to the minimum.

      "body": "> Prevent use of the 20-minute difficulty exception on the last block in a difficulty period\r\n\r\nI think the worst case here is that someone with significant hashpower quickly mines a few retarget periods to get the difficulty to increase a lot, then stops mining, and no one else is around with enough hashpower who's willing to mine a block.\r\n\r\nWith the rule above, that means we could get to the end of the period, but would then stall, as the last block would be expensive. With the rule in the PR we have, we'd instead probably get a full retarget period of min difficulty blocks, ~and then drop to min difficulty and still have a block storm~. [EDIT: with this patch, the 0'th block of each retarget period doesn't have the min difficulty exception, and the difficulty adjustment will always work its way back to this block if it doesn't find a higher than min difficulty block elsewhere in the retarget period, so testnet4 might stall on the 0'th block until an ASIC is pointed at it, but this won't trigger a block storm]\r\n\r\nWould it maybe be feasible to require min difficulty blocks to record the real difficulty in the nVersion field, and use that to calculate the expected difficulty for the next retarget period directly without having to search for a non-min-difficulty header? I think that wouldn't even conflict with versionbits signalling (though min difficulty blocks would not be able to signal for activation, but that seems fine).",

      "body": "Partial code review: the first commit 4e8b29ae234a05181ff9fd64ab3a74ba997e2eac looks good to me (of course it would partially change if we get a new genesis block).\r\n\r\nI thought a bit more about block storms...\r\n\r\nThe only (relevant) thing that distinguishes testnet3 from mainnet is `fPowAllowMinDifficultyBlocks`. In our `miner.cpp` code we potentially lower `pblock->nBits` of the block we're trying to mine once enough time has passed. This works because both the miner and validation rely on `GetNextWorkRequired` to tell us what the difficulty of a given block needs to be.\r\n\r\nBecause we \"mess with\" `nBits` itself, the code that handles difficulty adjustment (also `GetNextWorkRequired`, at the bottom) can be tricked. It takes the timestamp of the first block in the retarget period and passes it to `CalculateNextWorkRequired` along with the last block of retarget period (don't worry about off-by-one here). The low difficulty blocks probably came in fast, so difficulty goes up by a factor 4. But that factor 4 is applied to the last nbits value, which is the minimum difficulty.\r\n\r\nAnd so we have a situation where difficulty has to go all the way from 1 to something matching the actual hash power.\r\n\r\nOne way to fix that is, as discussed earlier, is to simply increase the minimum difficulty (maximum target) to something that requires a small ASIC. That would make block storms very expensive, but completely removes the ability to CPU mine.\r\n\r\n@fjahr's earlier code (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29775#pullrequestreview-2035943330) did not change `consensus.powLimit` but instead changed `GetNextWorkRequired` to enforce this. As a consequence the initial blocks after genesis could have difficulty 1, but once the difficulty goes above a typical S9, it can no longer drop below that. That seems confusing (in addition to the above).\r\n\r\nOne can always find a friend with an S9 space heater to mine a block, if this is really the only way to prevent block storms, but another solution would be better.\r\n\r\nSo we want:\r\n1. a way to CPU mine at very low difficulty, if nobody else mines a block within reasonable time\r\n2. not (dramatically) reduce the difficulty (a gradual decrease does seem desirable, so normal mining can continue with whatever hash power is structurally available)\r\n\r\nI think the key to that is to ensure difficulty adjustment is based on the last real-work nBits value.\r\n\r\nThe conceptually easiest thing to do imo is to stop lowering the nBits value, but instead simply _ignore_ the nBits value for blocks that are 2 x 10 minutes in the future. That way the difficulty adjustment calculation is not affected anymore.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately that allows anyone to override the most proof-of-work chain by producing blocks 20.01 minutes apart. That ability is capped by the 2-hour-future rule, but it still makes ASICs basically useless.\r\n\r\nSo then we get to @fjahr's proposed solution in 598f563687280fa6832ac42b9dc97c3ae7f7581d. We keep the low `nBits` value in blocks, but when calculating the difficulty for the next retarget period, we look at the last \"real\" `nBits` value.\r\n\r\n@ajtowns's suggestion to use nVersion could make sense if performance is a big issue, but otherwise I prefer the simplicity of @fjahr's approach.\r\n\r\nThis still allows for ~2000 difficulty 1 blocks in a given retarget period, since anyone can just set their clock 20 minutes in the future at the start of each retarget period. It wouldn't be a storm, but it would seem to make it fairly useless to point an ASIC at testnet.\r\n\r\nThese low difficulty blocks can be easily reorged by an ASIC, since they have very little total work. But in practice that requires them to invalidate the first block in such a series, because by default we produce block templates on our tip, even if it's \"brittle\" tip.\r\n\r\nThis last problem could be dealt with by changing `getblocktemplate` to build an empty block on top of the last non-special-min-difficulty-rules-block. (by default, and while also keeping the `bitcoin-cli -generate` behaviour of building on the tip)\r\n\r\n(I haven't thought about how the time warp bug interacts with any of this)",

Essentially untested.\r\n\r\nThe main advantage of this is that block 0 in a retarget period could also be min difficulty, allowing you to keep mining min-difficulty blocks with 20 minutes between them, halving the difficulty every 4 weeks / 2016 blocks, until you get to something that the network can mine on top of. The disadvantage is it's more intrusive.",

      "body": "> @fjahr's earlier code (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29775#pullrequestreview-2035943330) did not change consensus.powLimit but instead changed GetNextWorkRequired to enforce this. As a consequence the initial blocks after genesis could have difficulty 1, but once the difficulty goes above a typical S9, it can no longer drop below that.\r\n\r\nI did implement an exception to allow the difficulty to drop below the adjustment (1M in this case), see my comment on this in the old commit: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/515e3a9b94675a42b8e9635a6ceb8ea26c30e4d7#diff-4667f00c3a075be2753aa6ebdeea4bdbb66ef6e0b3d6df313a430f2eb8669ffdR32 But yeah, if we change it using `powLimit` would make more sense, but it was a proof of concept and I would have needed to find someone to mine a new Genesis block for me just to keep this PR testable because I don't have S9s lying around unfortunately :)\r\n\r\n> Something along the lines of [970c0c3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/970c0c31e99bebe2b60ade930c96600d1d82f7ca) maybe? Essentially untested.\r\n>\r\n> The main advantage of this is that block 0 in a retarget period could also be min difficulty, allowing you to keep mining min-difficulty blocks with 20 minutes between them, halving the difficulty every 4 weeks / 2016 blocks, until you get to something that the network can mine on top of. The disadvantage is it's more intrusive.\r\n\r\nAside from it being intrusive in our code, the miners who are using their own custom software and want to test it in Testnet would need to implement it as well. But I am not sure if that is significant.\r\n\r\nMaybe a more important question: What prevents someone malicious from writing an absurd number into the Version field? I guess to verify the number is actually correct worst case we would need to look further than our current difficulty adjustment period if it's all 20min blocks so it might be easier if we just do that right away? I.e. we would allow the 20min rule on the 0th block but to get the real difficulty we look back as far as we need to find the last real difficulty block and then apply the intermediate adjustments on that number if there were any between the current block and the last real difficulty block. Still thinking this through further though...\r\n\r\nEDIT: Either way this could become an issue for pruned nodes in an extreme case.\r\n\r\n> Here's a commit that makes getblocktemplate reorg low difficulty testnet4 blocks: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/commit/2125fc56163ceaddfadbc78ad0d0da5b1a99a8fa It adds some complexity, but not in the validation code. I wonder if it would be useful on testnet3.\r\n\r\nI think that's interesting. Maybe that is a helpful insight: if we can not find the perfect solution with a simple validation code adjustment, having miners reorg the min-difficulty blocks could make this attack a lot less feasible. I will think about it some more. However, I think those that use the 20min rule for mining their fancy non-standard transactions etc. might not like this because they would get reorged as well. Maybe we could just reorg the last block, not all min-diff blocks last seen. That would mean those that need this \"feature\" could have their fancy tx included in the blockchain if they mine one more min-diff block on top of it.",

      "body": "> We made `acceptnonstdtxn=0` the default for testnet3 in #28354. We could flip it back on. Or we could make it easier to preferentially peer with no-standardness nodes (and miners) to get those in. I don't think relying on low difficulty blocks is the right solution, at least I don't think it's a good enough reason to keep them around.\r\n\r\nYeah, I tend to agree, I thought about flipping it back on earlier as well: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29775#issuecomment-2041139129 but we weren't very far in the discussion yet. By now we are discussing pretty intrusive changes with the goal to prevent block storms but at the same time keep the 20min exploitable for this one good use case. These are obviously at odds. The motivation stated in #28354 was to align testnet behavior with the behavior of other chains but maybe compared to the other solutions this is the simplest solution to the problem. In terms of simplicity and from a maintenance perspective I think setting `minPow` to 1M and `acceptnonstdtxn=1` as default is still a good solution that we should keep it in mind as an alternative to the other proposed solutions. There we also have two things that are at odds: developers that want to get their non-standard tx into a block easily and developers that want to test if their tx would get into a block on mainnet (the case that triggered #28354). But this seems to me like something that can be fixed with better documentation and/or some variant of preferential peering? At least both of these user groups are not trying to be malicious and can be assumed to have some level of technical expertise.\r\n\r\n> When a miner reorgs a block, do non-standard transactions end up in its mempool or are they forgotten? The latter is probably safest, but we could allow it on testnet for this use case.\r\n\r\nI haven't had time to look at the code but I would be surprised if the `acceptnonstdtxn` flag is ignored in this case. Making this a testnet specific exception here could be a solution that is a small patch but overall it's not the simplest concept.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Seems like `acceptnonstdtxn` is still enforced on the txs from reorged blocks. The flag sets `m_require_standard` on the mempool, this is then used in `PreChecks()`. That function is used in `AcceptSingleTransaction()` which is then used in `MaybeUpdateMempoolForReorg()` via `AcceptToMemoryPool()`.",

If you're testing something that will require miners with meaningful hashpower running non-default things on mainnet, finding a miner who'll do the same thing on testnet first doesn't seem that unreasonable to me. You can always test on regtest or a custom signet as well, after all.\r\n\r\nAs far as `CCN 02/May/2024 Bitcoin Testnet Could Need Reset After 13 Years` goes, the point of putting a news item in the genesis block was to prevent the possibility of pre-mining. Doing that with something referring to the project itself is exploitable: all you need to do is make a deal in advance with CCN that on May 2nd they'll post an article with that title, and you can start mining in advance. For testnet that perhaps doesn't matter, but if it doesn't there's no reason to change the commitment in the first place. Where it does matter is if people take our example and reuse it in an altcoin where premining would be a problem -- but there's an easy solution there: simply use the latest bitcoin block hash.",

I tend to remove it again because I like to keep things simple unless there is more support to add it.\r\n  - Re-enabling `acceptnonstdtxn` received rejections as an alternative solution to get non-standard txs into blocks outside of min-difficulty blocks\r\n  - @Sjors suggestion to nudge miners to reorg min-difficulty blocks didn't see much engagement other than me thinking that it's an interesting idea but it also has wider implications that would make Testnet behave very differently than Mainnet and I am not sure if that is worth it\r\n  - @ajtowns idea to persist the real difficulty in the version field saw some interest from Sjors and there is some unaddressed feedback from me here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29775#issuecomment-2093325471\r\n  - @murchandamus also [suggested earlier](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29775#issuecomment-2091226696) basically keeping the nBits intact in the header but ignoring it. It didn't see much engagement but I think this is essentially a variant of AJ's suggestion to persist the original difficulty in version. I think it would have the same downsides and I believe it comes down to looking back further than the current period may give us the same behavior with a much simpler code change. That is, if we are willing to ignore the problem this could cause pruned nodes in extreme cases (and I think the same danger is there if the value is persisted somehow but ignored since pruned nodes could just be lied to in that case).\r\n\r\n- Genesis Block\r\n  - @jlopp  suggested block received rejections on the content of the message and \"self-advertisement\" though it wasn't very clear to me what this was referring to. I think at least we need another variation with the latest block hash in the message.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what I got wrong and if I forgot something. As it stands I tend to remove the time-warp fix again and just keep a fix for the difficulty adjustment bug, everything else doesn't seem to have clear support yet.",

If it's sufficiently addressing it or if we need to do something more (like regularly scheduled resets etc.) we will only know once we have tried and I haven't seen any other proposal to address this issue, nor do I think there is anything else we can do that would work unless we turn this into some variant of a signet.\r\n\r\n> It should be noted that the 'Griefing Attack' is still an attack, and its aim was to make it difficult for people to use testnet3.

This also means that I don't care so much that he proposes to embed the article that interviews him, because I think we all agree (especially @jlopp ) that it's embedded into something meaningless and without value. In the end, the headline of all of this is: we shouldn't be passionate about any aspect of testnet at all, it should just serve its purpose.\r\n\r\n@jlopp has suggested a full Genesis block and mined it too, if he addresses the concern and adds a recent block hash to the message I will use it unless there is someone else here who also provides a full Genesis block that is mined with a different message that reviewers prefer over @jlopp s one. I simply don't want to mine the Genesis block myself over and over again as the message gets bikeshedded.",

See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/970c0c31e99bebe2b60ade930c96600d1d82f7ca#diff-4667f00c3a075be2753aa6ebdeea4bdbb66ef6e0b3d6df313a430f2eb8669ffdR47\r\n\r\n> I guess to verify the number is actually correct worst case we would need to look further than our current difficulty adjustment period if it's all 20min blocks\r\n\r\nThe rules would be:\r\n\r\n * given a block A and its parent P, `real_bits(A) = (A.time - P.time >= 20 minutes ? A.nVersion : A.nBits)`\r\n * if A isn't the first block in a retarget period, `real_bits(A) = real_bits(P)`\r\n * if A is the first block in a retarget period, `real_bits(A) = x * real_bits(P)` where `x` is the usual factor\r\n\r\nThat means you only ever need to look at the two preceding blocks (you need to know if they were 20 minutes apart, as to whether nVersion or nBits is what you look at) to calculate the current block's target.",

      "body": "The genesis block message is just for fun, since almost nobody will ever see it. There were half a dozen articles written about testnet recently, however the CCN article was the only one with a relevant title that mentioned resetting testnet. I don't think the \"strength\" of the message to prevent pre-mining really matters if we agree that the primary goal is for testnet tokens to not have value.\r\n\r\nThe goal of my griefing was to bring attention to this issue, and I dare say that it worked. We're here to discuss looking forward to the future with testnet4; the future of testnet3 should be irrelevant. Will testnet4 manage to accrue value? There's only one way to find out - though I seriously doubt that people are going to put money into a network that starts having a history of regularly being abandoned.\r\n\r\nI also hope that we can standardize the process of resetting testnet so that it's easier to do so in the future. As I mention in my essay, I believe the current state of testnet is a culmination of both technical issues (block storms) and cultural issues (apathy about putting in the work for a reset.)\r\n\r\nI'm happy to continue generating as many genesis blocks as is required.

So you could mine perhaps 3 min-difficulty blocks immediately, but would then have to wait 10m before you can do another one, and if a real difficulty block is mined in the meantime, you're back to a long-ish wait before you can try again. Not really sure there's anything worth fixing here though -- if someone decides to mine min difficulty blocks whenever the tip's timestamp is less than 1h40m in the future, is that really a big deal?",

Could you say precisely which (combination) of the [ideas given here so far](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29775#issuecomment-2094300149) do you consider a fix? Currently this PR includes the fix for block storms as we know them now in the [second commit](c8806da27cebc60b3755734690f95c9d540868d3) with the downside that a miner can still run up the hash rate and leave ([described here in more detail](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29775#issuecomment-2092080764)) and the fix for the time warp attack in the [third commit](0fae96f589f943dd993aa20b40a2c3d1bcd11083). Do you think this is sufficient or if not, what else would you like to be included?",

I find it more elegant and intuitive if we allow the use on all blocks and prevent the adjustment from being affected by it.\r\n\r\n> > Alternatively, I would be satisfied if using the 20-minute difficulty exception would be changed such that nBits could remain at the proper value, and were available for any block in the difficulty period without incurring the difficulty resetting to the minimum. However, my understanding is that the difficulty check in block validation is context independent, and therefore a block would fail if the hash were higher than the nBits value in its own header.\r\n> \r\n> I am not sure I understand this: you are talking about the fix I have proposed here, right? If that is so, I am not sure I understand why the header would diverge from the block on the nBits though.\r\n\r\nSorry, ISTM that I had misunderstood how you implemented that the difficulty adjustment was unaffected by the 20-minute exception. I am fine with any solution that prevents loss of liveliness and mitigates extended blockstorms: i.e. I’m fine with block gusts of <20 blocks or waiting for ~20 minutes to be able to mine a block, but would consider it a failure if there are no new blocks on testnet for extended periods of time while someone is waiting for confirmation. \r\n\r\n> So the question is this: if a high hashrate miner deliberately stalls testnet and we limp along for an entire difficulty adjustment period with minimum difficulty blocks, what should happen?\r\n\r\nIt would also make sense to me that if a majority of the blocks in a difficulty period were found with the exception, the difficulty adjust downwards towards some minimum. At the very least, it should halve the real difficulty, because the blocks took twice as long as expected, even if they all were mined at the minimum difficulty.",

As a result, just syncing the first few thousand blocks of testnet3 is a reasonable test case for anything validating scripts.\r\n\r\nI'd strongly encourage the same be done for testnet4, but to improve coverage substantially compared to testnet3 we should consider getting some test-cases out of the Bitcoin Core script fuzzer(s) and embedding that in the chain.\r\n\r\nIt was also pointed out to me that testnet3 includes a timewarp exploit early in its history, so might want to pre-mine the same if we don't try to fix that as a part of testnet4\r\n\r\nIn practice today that probably means pre-mining a handful of blocks to add the test cases and then checkpointing the end of the pre-mine.",

I don't think that makes a difference anymore?\r\n\r\nI find it more elegant, but only if we need another genesis block.\r\n\r\n> In practice today that probably means pre-mining a handful of blocks to add the test cases and then checkpointing the end of the pre-mine.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense if we want the test cases as early as possible in the chain. In that case someone should provide such a script in the next few months, then we can make a new genesis block, run the script, add the checkpoint and merge this PR.\r\n\r\nI do hope we can rid of the checkpoint code entirely (see #25725), but maybe by then testnet4 will have enough work on it that a reorg is unlikely.\r\n\r\nI'm fine with the difficulty fix in e172a96c0781de2bbd69312905d2c16cc1745c2f. Although these minimum difficulty blocks are always at risk of getting wiped out using https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/commit/2125fc56163ceaddfadbc78ad0d0da5b1a99a8fa, I agree that doesn't need to be the default - given the use case of including non-standard transactions.\r\n\r\n> It would also make sense to me that if a majority of the blocks in a difficulty period were found with the exception, the difficulty adjust downwards towards some minimum. At the very least, it should halve the real difficulty, because the blocks took twice as long as expected, even if they all were mined at the minimum difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation it's far quicker to jack up the difficulty by 1000x than it takes to drop it. I didn't do the math on the way up, the way down takes 40 weeks (4 week retarget period, each cutting difficulty in half).\r\n\r\nThe testnet4 specific code could increase `nActualTimespan` by n minutes for each minimum difficulty block. For n = 20 that speeds up the way down to 20 weeks (4 week retarget period, each cutting difficulty by 4). For n = 60 the network (almost) recovers in 12 weeks (4 week retarget period, each cutting difficulty by 8).\r\n\r\nThis can be done by only touching code inside the `if (testnet4)` branch.",

The seed requires some amount of recent uptime. I had one running as well, but it was on an earlier genesis block.

Perhaps just add 20 minutes to `nActualTimespan` so it drops by usual maximum 4x?",

That makes sense: we've had 12 retarget periods, and if each time the difficulty maximally increased, you get exactly 4^12.\r\n\r\nIn order to get test vectors in early, we'd have to reset with a new genesis block and immediately publish the transactions.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to set the genesis block difficulty to whatever the network difficulty is when we reset it. But that's pure cosmetics.\r\n\r\nI reviewed the timewarp commit, because ideally we get this right the first time. Then a mainnet soft fork only needs to change the `if (consensusParams.hashGenesisBlock...` check with `DeploymentActiveAfter`.",

The best thing out there now is just the mailing list and this PR, which I don't even know which parts of the mailing list this PR is supporting without reading into the code.\n\nTestnet is where devs actually test things and this is ridiculous that it's being pushed out like this. Yes for mainnet people mostly run Core but for testnet people are more open to alt-implementations and so just pushing it out like this is irresponsible because there needs to be cross compatibility between implementations.\n\nI'll be NACK-ing all testnet4 support on btcd and will not be supporting testnet4 utreexod until there's a written out specification for it.",

      "body": "> In the current implementation it's far quicker to jack up the difficulty by 1000x than it takes to drop it. I didn't do the math on the way up, the way down takes 40 weeks (4 week retarget period, each cutting difficulty in half).\r\n>\r\n> The testnet4 specific code could increase nActualTimespan by n minutes for each minimum difficulty block. For n = 20 that speeds up the way down to 20 weeks (4 week retarget period, each cutting difficulty by 4). For n = 60 the network (almost) recovers in 12 weeks (4 week retarget period, each cutting difficulty by 8).\r\n\r\nI forgot to address this comment from @Sjors earlier: I think it's an interesting idea but I am not sure about the adverse effects this could have. The base case for the network should be that we have a fluctuating but somewhat stable hashrate and a few people will use the 20-min rule to get their non-standard txs in or just to get some coins. How many these will be of the 2016 blocks, I don't know. Let's say it's 100 20-min blocks and they are always mined instantly (no time wasted; I am ignoring real 20-min blocks of which we will certainly also see a few). Then in this state when difficulty should be adjusted up (because the 100 blocks came fast) but instead the difficulty would be adjusted down because of the adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe worst case I think is that someone tries to get as many 20-min blocks as possible constantly and with that grinds down the difficulty so that we will have a much faster block time than 10 minutes. I didn't do the exact math on it to see where we end up in an equilibrium in that case but I think this would pretty annoying.\r\n\r\nI think even if there is no attack we would end up with a faster block time on average. Maybe we don't want to assume any stability as the base case but I am still not sure the upside outweighs the downside on this. I will keep thinking about it more if I can think of more edge cases where this might lead to different outcomes than we want.",

      "body": "I missed that before, but the improved text on the BIP made me realize. It looks like an attacker could jack up the difficulty by mining a few difficulty periods with an ASIC and then stop after the last block in a difficulty period. The network would then be on a difficulty some 4<sup>n</sup> higher than before, and stuck looking to mine a first block at full difficulty.\r\n\r\nI previously understood that for the difficulty it just goes back to the _latest_ block that has a non-1 difficulty, and didn’t realize that the first block would need to be mined at full difficulty. Is there a way to prevent the reset to minimum difficulty while allowing the 20-minute exception for every block? Would that require something like @ajtowns’s storing the actual difficulty in the version or similar?",

      "body": "> I missed that before, but the improved text on the BIP made me realize. It looks like an attacker could jack up the difficulty by mining a few difficulty periods with an ASIC and then stop after the last block in a difficulty period. The network would then be on a difficulty some 4n higher than before, and stuck looking to mine a first block at full difficulty.\r\n> \r\n> I previously understood that for the difficulty it just goes back to the _latest_ block that has a non-1 difficulty, and didn’t realize that the first block would need to be mined at full difficulty. Is there a way to prevent the reset to minimum difficulty while allowing the 20-minute exception for every block? Would that require something like @ajtowns’s storing the actual difficulty in the version or similar?\r\n\r\nYes, this has also been described [here by AJ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29775#issuecomment-2092080764).\r\n\r\n@Sjors suggestion to change `nActualTimespan` was also aimed at this problem but I have a few doubts outlined above. I think @ajtowns suggestion to use the version field is the only complete solution for this problem so far.",

I think @ajtowns suggestion to use the version field is the only complete solution for this problem so far.\r\n\r\nThanks for keeping the overview! :)\r\nI guess if someone were to troll testnet in that manner, it might have a social solution, where we could probably convince some ASIC-directing individual to point some hashpower at Testnet for one block per difficulty period until the difficulty recovers to reasonable heights. Otherwise, it might be a good time to reset again. ;)",

      "body": "> If we were in a situation where Testnet has no ASICs mining it and someone points a millionth of the mainnet hashpower at Testnet (today about 650 TH/s), they could easily mine 10 difficulty periods in minutes and put the first block of the next difficulty period well out of the range of non-ASICs.\r\n\r\nThe hashpower on Testnet3 seems to have been fluctuating around ~500 TH/s over the past 2 years: https://mempool.space/testnet/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty If that data is correct, I am not so concerned about 650 TH/s but I am not sure if the 20-min exception blocks mess with those statistics.\r\n\r\nWhy do you think this issue has never happened on Testnet3? Someone can run up the difficulty there today like you describe and leave on the last block of a difficulty adjustment period, the chain would stall the same as with the code here.\r\n\r\nI wrote a little script to check how many adjustment blocks took longer than 20min and what the most extreme cases were. It doesn't look too bad honestly, over these 13 years we have had a handful that took more than an hour, two over 5h, but I would have expected to find worse. The delta is just comparing the timestamp to the previous block, so granted, there could be some shenanigans going on and that's not the real delta but even if the prev block actually had a timestamp 2 hours in the future for example, it still doesn't seem too terrible to me to have these few outliers over 13 years.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>See logs</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nHeight: 16128, Time Difference: 1201 seconds\r\nHeight: 20160, Time Difference: 1338 seconds\r\nHeight: 26208, Time Difference: 1613 seconds\r\nHeight: 32256, Time Difference: 2430 seconds\r\nHeight: 38304, Time Difference: 1843 seconds\r\nHeight: 92736, Time Difference: 1742 seconds\r\nHeight: 108864, Time Difference: 1379 seconds\r\nHeight: 127008, Time Difference: 19999 seconds\r\nHeight: 205632, Time Difference: 3426 seconds\r\nHeight: 225792, Time Difference: 2892 seconds\r\nHeight: 243936, Time Difference: 2509 seconds\r\nHeight: 270144, Time Difference: 8494 seconds\r\nHeight: 276192, Time Difference: 1410 seconds\r\nHeight: 278208, Time Difference: 5749 seconds\r\nHeight: 308448, Time Difference: 2898 seconds\r\nHeight: 314496, Time Difference: 1884 seconds\r\nHeight: 316512, Time Difference: 8331 seconds\r\nHeight: 318528, Time Difference: 3992 seconds\r\nHeight: 322560, Time Difference: 5553 seconds\r\nHeight: 328608, Time Difference: 5121 seconds\r\nHeight: 374976, Time Difference: 1428 seconds\r\nHeight: 530208, Time Difference: 3827 seconds\r\nHeight: 546336, Time Difference: 2645 seconds\r\nHeight: 921312, Time Difference: 1830 seconds\r\nHeight: 925344, Time Difference: 1664 seconds\r\nHeight: 1034208, Time Difference: 1205 seconds\r\nHeight: 1116864, Time Difference: 3558 seconds\r\nHeight: 1179360, Time Difference: 2390 seconds\r\nHeight: 1288224, Time Difference: 1469 seconds\r\nHeight: 1296288, Time Difference: 2198 seconds\r\nHeight: 1354752, Time Difference: 2686 seconds\r\nHeight: 1518048, Time Difference: 2423 seconds\r\nHeight: 1572480, Time Difference: 1607 seconds\r\nHeight: 1576512, Time Difference: 3231 seconds\r\nHeight: 1578528, Time Difference: 4781 seconds\r\nHeight: 1580544, Time Difference: 1757 seconds\r\nHeight: 1665216, Time Difference: 4310 seconds\r\nHeight: 1721664, Time Difference: 2089 seconds\r\nHeight: 1830528, Time Difference: 1461 seconds\r\nHeight: 1901088, Time Difference: 1672 seconds\r\nHeight: 1903104, Time Difference: 2170 seconds\r\nHeight: 1971648, Time Difference: 2227 seconds\r\nHeight: 1975680, Time Difference: 1683 seconds\r\nHeight: 2034144, Time Difference: 1615 seconds\r\nHeight: 2096640, Time Difference: 1849 seconds\r\nHeight: 2098656, Time Difference: 1940 seconds\r\nHeight: 2102688, Time Difference: 1495 seconds\r\nHeight: 2134944, Time Difference: 1494 seconds\r\nHeight: 2163168, Time Difference: 1359 seconds\r\nHeight: 2225664, Time Difference: 3482 seconds\r\nHeight: 2245824, Time Difference: 1852 seconds\r\nHeight: 2314368, Time Difference: 2212 seconds\r\nHeight: 2342592, Time Difference: 1461 seconds\r\nHeight: 2348640, Time Difference: 1685 seconds\r\nHeight: 2419200, Time Difference: 2266 seconds\r\nHeight: 2421216, Time Difference: 1885 seconds\r\nHeight: 2425248, Time Difference: 1477 seconds\r\nHeight: 2431296, Time Difference: 18461 seconds\r\nHeight: 2530080, Time Difference: 1603 seconds\r\nHeight: 2534112, Time Difference: 1884 seconds\r\nHeight: 2538144, Time Difference: 1213 seconds\r\nHeight: 2578464, Time Difference: 3759 seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>",

      "body": "> Do blocks mined with the exception count towards the total work according to difficulty-1 or the actual difficulty? If it’s the latter, in testnet3 you could just invalidate the last block in the previous difficulty period with a difficulty-1 block. If it’s the former, I agree, the absence of this attack may indicate that I’m worrying too much.\r\n\r\n(Side-note: I first read difficulty-1 as \"difficulty minus 1\" and got a bit confused but I think you mean the same as \"difficulty=1\")\r\n\r\nI needed to check this myself: Total work is calculated [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2d21060af831fa8f8f1791b4464961d5f28a88cb/src/node/blockstorage.cpp#L226) and [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2d21060af831fa8f8f1791b4464961d5f28a88cb/src/node/blockstorage.cpp#L440) (the formula is identical). This calls [`GetBlockProof()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2d21060af831fa8f8f1791b4464961d5f28a88cb/src/chain.cpp#L131) which uses the blocks `nBits`, not the actual target difficulty of the current period. So total work is only increased by difficulty-1.",

If it’s the latter, in testnet3 you could just invalidate the last block in the previous difficulty period with a difficulty-1 block. If it’s the former, I agree, the absence of this attack may indicate that I’m worrying too much.\r\n> \r\n> (Side-note: I first read difficulty-1 as \"difficulty minus 1\" and got a bit confused but I think you mean the same as \"difficulty=1\")\r\n> \r\n> I needed to check this myself: Total work is calculated [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2d21060af831fa8f8f1791b4464961d5f28a88cb/src/node/blockstorage.cpp#L226) and [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2d21060af831fa8f8f1791b4464961d5f28a88cb/src/node/blockstorage.cpp#L440) (the formula is identical). This calls [`GetBlockProof()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2d21060af831fa8f8f1791b4464961d5f28a88cb/src/chain.cpp#L131) which uses the blocks `nBits`, not the actual target difficulty of the current period. So total work is only increased by difficulty-1.\r\n\r\nYeah I meant that as \"difficulty one\", i.e. minimum difficulty.",

There is a strange occurrence that happens, not sure I would call it an \"attack\" but someone is shifting timestamps by exactly 20 minutes 1 second.  Sometimes several times in a row.  Generally it is up to 6 blocks at most.  I am not sure what the exact trigger is, but it doesnt happen too often.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/65864/f775d792-91f3-441f-b403-0340f14ae276)\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the longest that I have seen, which is 10, but the timestamps change half way through.\r\n\r\nhttps://mempool.space/testnet4/block/000000004e280b94d1109ec8d94aa29d2b5171c85dbaab40b71c856616949a5a\r\n\r\nT4 is going to be great for developers to work with, and I think it should be used more, for example with layer 2 solutions such as client validation, and colored coins.

What tools could be used to produce a block header with a particular shifted timestamp so that in the next step one could use `bitcoin-util grind` to perform proof of work on hex header string (i.e. CPU-mine such a block)?\r\n\r\nWhat conditions need to be met to cause a blockchain reorg this way?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Reading [bitcoin.it](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm) and [developer.bitcoin.org](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/block_chain.html#merkle-trees) already",

Because testnet3 and testnet4 are the only networks I know of, where CPUs and ASICs can co-exist.\r\n\r\nFor example: if after 20 minutes, any block would be accepted, but at the same time, the real difficulty would be placed in the block header, then that kind of trick would be impossible, because ASICs would trivially provide more work, somewhere between the minimal, and the real difficulty. However, because you can mine at difficulty one, or at the real difficulty, and you cannot work on both cases at the same time, then the end result is that some ASIC can work hard, and get a block, but you can spend much less work on your CPU, and also get a similar reward.\r\n\r\n> not sure I would call it an \"attack\"\r\n\r\nIf it is \"an attack\", then it can be easily patched: any ASIC-mined block can easily reorg some CPU-mined block. Also, ASIC miners can apply similar strategies as well, and then CPU miners will have no chance again (a good question is: should devs be able to CPU-mine those coins or not).\r\n\r\nAnother \"solution\" is to treat CPU-mined blocks as \"weak blocks\", which could be intended to \"always be reorged\". But then, it would push testnet even closer to the mainnet, if the real difficulty will be always preserved, and if chains of easier blocks will always vanish. Or: the whole testnet can consist of only weak blocks, then it would have no chance to gain any value, if everything will be always reorged, and if archival testing blocks would be available only as a stale blocks.\r\n\r\nA lot of things to think about, but as long as testnet4 is not officially deployed, it can be adjusted if needed.\r\n\r\nEdit: You can inspect closer tb1qvy67actlsslmvwpjzk9hnx6jf04g5y26sz5crx on testnet3 and testnet4. This is the address I use for testing. Some time ago, I heard that it is harder and harder for developers to get some new test coins. You can check, how many blocks were generated on them (only with CPU! No ASIC used!), and answer a question \"is it enough for development?\".",

      "body": "Great analysis, thanks\r\n\r\nI have seen two instances where the diff drops to 1.  The first is when the mining dries up for 20 minutes, and then someone will mine a block, just to keep the chain going (normally wiz :)).\r\n\r\nThe other is when people are deliberately propagating blocks with a future timestamp, up to about 6 blocks.  Coincidentally 6 * 20 = 2 hours.  I do not know what triggers this.\r\n\r\nThe 20 minute rule when used properly is quite nice as it keeps the chain flowing.  The future spoofed timestamp blocks dont happen too often, so are not too disruptive.\r\n\r\nRegarding reorgs, it would make sense to just build on the 20 minute block (as a kind of etiquette) with an asic and not reorg.  The spoofed timestamps might be more fair game for a reorg.  But this is not yet happening.",

I verified that it currently matches the actual genesis block (`getblockhash 0`).\r\n\r\nIt's not dangerous to mainnet if we forget, it would only break testnet4. But I would prefer to introduce an `enum class Network` so we can do `consensusParams.network == Network::Testnet4`. It can wait for a followup.\r\n\r\nIf you're worried about growing `struct Params` you can remove `fPowNoRetargeting` and replace its use with consensusParams.network == Network::Regtest`. Basically anything that's only used by a single test network might as well use this more direct approach.",

If nothing changes, then for period C this seeks back to the first block of period B, finds the real value and applies it.\r\n\r\nBut then how do the first blocks of B and C ever mined?\r\n\r\nWell, remember that `GetNextWorkRequired` ignores the `nBit` value if enough time went by.\r\n\r\nA test would be nice, but unfortunately it seems the only way to do that is to introduce a new regtest with the same rule, but at much lower difficulty.",

      "body": "> Well, remember that GetNextWorkRequired ignores the nBit value if enough time went by.\r\n\r\nThat last part isn't true. The first block of the difficulty period does not allow the usage of the 20-min rule. That code is wrapped in the following if statement so `GetNextWorkRequired` always passes off to `CalculateNextWorkRequired` for the first block in a new difficulty period.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Only change once per difficulty adjustment interval\r\nif ((pindexLast->nHeight+1) % params.DifficultyAdjustmentInterval() != 0) {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI managed to confuse myself with this again today as well, so I added an adapted version of your comment here. The confusing part for me is that this is not a change of behavior which is why I also failed to emphasize this in the BIP so far. The first block of the difficulty period also can not use the 20-min rule in Testnet 3. But there it can get difficulty 1 when the last block of the previous period was mined with the 20-min rule, which then leads to a block storm.\r\n\r\nFor this to work the way you describe we would need to add the 20-min also in `CalculateNextWorkRequired` but that just gives us back the good ol' block storms. Maybe we could add something crazy there like 24 hours, that would mean we reset to 1 to get unstuck if a block isn't found for a day without anyone pointing their asic to it. But I am not sure we really need this.",
