    "title": "Consideration of a Code of Conduct and/or written rules for moderation",
    "body": "There have been a number of events over the past several months which have resulted in various individuals requesting that moderation action be taken. However, without any actual guidelines for when moderation actions should be taken, and of what sort, the bare minimum of moderating obvious spam is only done. This appears to leave many contributors dissatisfied as I have frequently heard grumblings about the behavior of various people leaving comments on PRs and issues. As such, I think it would be prudent for us to reconsider adding a Code of Conduct or otherwise some written rules of moderation so that moderation actions can be taken more proactively.\r\n\r\nWhile short pithy statements like \"be excellent to each other\" and \"don't be an asshole\" are great sound bites, they do very little to actually establish what behavior is acceptable, and when and what moderation actions can be taken. As someone who does moderation actions, personally I would like to have more guidance from other contributors on the moderation actions that they would like me to do.\r\n\r\nThe last time this was brought up, in #26890, there were concerns about the specific wording of the proposed Code of Conduct. Instead of proposing a specific text this time around, I've opted to first revisit the idea on its own, and we can try to nail down the text at a later date. But here are a few examples of Codes of Conduct that we may want to adopt (with modifications):\r\n\r\n* CoreDev events: https://github.com/coredev-tech/coredev-tech.github.io/blob/master/files/CoreDev-Code-of-Conduct.pdf\r\n* LDK: https://lightningdevkit.org/code_of_conduct/\r\n* Linux Kernel: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/code-of-conduct.html\r\n* FreeBSD: https://www.freebsd.org/internal/code-of-conduct/\r\n* FSF/GNU: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html\r\n* Python: https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/\r\n* Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/\r\n\r\nThere were also a few concerns last time about a Code of Conduct or any other written rules being used as a vehicle for harassment. While I don't doubt that this is certainly possible, I think that having something written down would be overall more beneficial than not. I also think that if such a situation were to arise, it would be possible to amend the document to cover those cases.\r\n\r\nAs this discussion is about how frequent contributors feel about a Code of Conduct and moderation in their place of work, discussion of this issue is limited to members of the org. Comments from others may be deleted or hidden as off topic. If you are not a member but think you should be, send me a message by email or IRC.",

      "body": "I agree more moderation would be useful, but I would propose something more lightweight and less prescriptive than a code of conduct. I think we should try short-term bans of posters who causing specific problems, with full transparency so it's clear:\r\n\r\n- Who is currently banned\r\n- What specific reasons they were banned for, with links to relevant issues or comments\r\n- When the ban will end\r\n- Who made the decision to ban them\r\n\r\nI think it would be good if bans were fairly short, starting at a few days and not lasting more than a few months.\r\n\r\nI think this could be a good approach because a ban does not need to imply that anyone has done something wrong or immoral, it could just be a tool for allowing overheated discussions to cool off.",

After wrangling the nutbar attackers in IRC for a decade, I would offer my gentle warning that the insidiousness of the characters you are going to be dealing with in the coming years can't really be understated. I would suggest that a CoC of this type will be more likely to be used against you than it will be the tool you hope will become a facilitator of diplomatic discourse.\r\n\r\nSee also http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8609",

      "body": "It is crucial for the Bitcoin Core project to adopt a code of conduct if it aims to enhance its organization, gain credibility, and attract more dedicated contributors as it grows. In this regard, the Linux kernel's code of conduct could serve as an exemplary model. Given the anticipated expansion of Bitcoin Core, especially in terms of contributor numbers, it could soon rival the scale of the Linux kernel.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I have concerns about potential misuse of this tool that must be addressed. Specifically, the issues already highlighted in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26890 raise valid points regarding how the code of conduct could be exploited to sow discord within the community and incite unnecessary conflicts. It is imperative that measures are put in place to prevent such outcomes, however I'm unsure of how that could be achieved. I guess that having a code of conduct, in the context of Bitcoin Core, might paradoxically serve as a double-edged sword, obtaining the opposite result of what is intended if not properly used.",

We've navigated challenges and disagreements without it, relying on the decentralized nature of Bitcoin itself to maintain order.\r\n\r\nLooking at the experience of other communities, such as the Rust language, we must ask: What safeguards us from implementing a code of conduct and facing similar issues? Could we inadvertently pave the way for a Bitcoin foundation tomorrow, potentially leading to centralization and bureaucratic hurdles?\r\n\r\nThe absence of a formal code of conduct may signify a commitment to preserving the core principles of decentralization and censorship resistance. It's crucial to differentiate between genuine efforts to foster inclusivity and support and the imposition of rules that may stifle open discourse and innovation.\r\n\r\nLet's continue to uphold the values that have propelled Bitcoin forward, fostering an environment where diverse perspectives can flourish without the need for rigid guidelines.",

      "body": "I’ll first point out that moderation is very much necessary. Beyond brigading and flamewar PR discussions, it seems many people do not realize the amount of spam (\"actual spam\") this repo gets. This is a github repository where people collaborate on code; it's not a discussion forum for everybody to voice their opinions about Bitcoin and Bitcoin development (there are lots of other places for that).\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that moderators are often accused of censorship and of making decisions subjectively, due to an absurd notion that “everybody can contribute to this open source project” means that abuse, harassment, and spam should be tolerated and welcomed as part of technical discussion. We also genuinely don't want to discourage people from joining the community and spend a lot of time worrying whether we're making a moderation decision that everybody agrees with. This makes moderators too scared to act and, consequently, makes this a worse community and more unproductive place to work.\r\n\r\nSo apart from agreeing to a code of conduct and moderation policy that establishes what kind of space we want to work in - which is something we should decide on as a community - I’m also interested in formalizing this as a way to protect *moderators*. Applying a process that is transparent, consistent, and based on objective guidelines we agreed to as a community is a much more straightforward task.\r\n\r\nI completely agree that this discussion about guidelines for behavior on this github repository (again, a place where people work on code together) should just include the people who regularly contribute to the codebase.",

They all really just outline the kind of space that they want to foster for their respective projects, some pointers on how to achieve that, and some things to not do. I think they're fairly loose and don't really prescribe how people must actually behave nor necessarily exact things that would be violations or specific consequences for doing so. Rather, they do seem to all just state that they want their communities to be welcoming and respectful, and if anyone feels like that is being violated, they can report a CoC violation.\r\n\r\n> I think we should try short-term bans of posters who causing specific problems, with full transparency so it's clear:\r\n\r\nSure, but the question has always been what behaviors do contributors think are ban worthy, and the lack of any guidelines for that is what brings up this issue.\r\n\r\n> maybe we could consider opening a new repository like bitcoin-core/moderation or bitcoin-core/gh to track issues like this related to moderation, or management of the github org.\r\n\r\nI agree with having these kinds of issues be in a separate place. I think the Discussions feature could be used for this as well.\r\n\r\n> For what it's worth, I think it will be extremely difficult to prevent the weaponization of the loose language, including the requirement to accept veiled criticism and encouraging weaponized demands for apologies.\r\n\r\nIIRC this is a criticism of the specific text proposed in the previous PR, but the point of this one is not to propose a specific text yet. It's not clear to me how the examples I've linked to would require accepting veiled criticism or encourage weaponized demands for apologies, so I think this problem can be avoided by using different language.\r\n\r\n> See also http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8609\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this is open source and no one is obligated to work with you. You could be a genius super coder, but be a complete asshole that is hard to work with, and it is everyone's right to decide to never speak with you. Being good at something doesn't give you the right to force everyone to listen to you.\r\n\r\n[Well-kept Gardens Die By Pacifism](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tscc3e5eujrsEeFN4/well-kept-gardens-die-by-pacifism) and I certainly think we're well on the road to death considering how little moderation occurs in this repo and the IRC channel. We can even see from the [2023's contributor survey results](https://adamjonas.com/bitcoin/coredev/retro/coredev-2023-retro/) that the number of contributors has been steadily decreasing and that disruption from both contributors and non-contributors have been a major frustration in the past couple years. I do not want to suggest that there is evidence for a direct causal link between lacking moderation and fewer contributors, but it's not so much a stretch to say that this may be a factor, among many others. More active moderation and a guidelines for that moderation (whether that be a code of conduct or something else) seems like proper way to resolve these issues.",

      "body": "> As such, I think it would be prudent for us to reconsider adding a Code of Conduct or otherwise some written rules of moderation so that moderation actions can be taken more proactively.\r\n\r\nLike I said [last time](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26890#issuecomment-1382673362), I think more proactive moderation is a good idea, but adding a code of conduct will likely cause more problems than it solves. Moderation is naturally a judgement call, and either people support the people making those judgement calls or they don't. Trying to specify what's good behaviour just encourages lawyer-style parsing of the terms, and if you're just talking in generalities like \"be excellent to each other\" you're not really providing any help to the people who might actually want some help.\r\n\r\nIf mods/others want to write some \"how to constructively engage with other contributors\" advice (like productivity.md or developer-notes.md) that's likely fine, and allows for a positive focus on good behaviour rather than a negative one on the worst contributors. (\"oops, I got moderated, how should I react?\" might be a good question to have an answer for, for people who're trying to be constructive, but don't always succeed, and are afraid that more proactive moderation might cause them to be exiled/excommunicated)\r\n\r\nIf repo admins/mods want to have a private wiki page with some bullet points for what should be moderated and what shouldn't so they can be consistent with each other, especially in the early days of being more proactive, that probably also makes sense. (Trying to coordinate a response to attackers while being completely transparent in all your plans on how you'll respond seems like a losing bet to me, so beyond [ryanofsky's suggestions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29507#issuecomment-1970112884) about making it possible to audit the actual actions taken, I think there are limits on how much transparency is a good thing)\r\n\r\n(To be explicit: I don't support adding a code of conduct, however I do support the current repo admins being more proactive in moderating comments, even if they insist on making a code of conduct as part of doing so)",

You can't write a set of rules or an algorithm to determine what is rambling or off-topic. It will be totally dependent on the PR and the proposed change. Stop wasting time, be proactive and transparent with your moderation decisions and certainly don't start blocking people for weeks or months. That is another terrible rabbit hole to go down. GitHub allows you to mark a comment as abuse or off-topic as you have done on this issue. It also allows anyone to view the comments that you have marked as abuse or off-topic. Use the tools available to you and stop trying to become a subpar lawyer. You're not a Core maintainer because of your legal expertise.",

      "body": "> I think it's important to point out here that a CoC is basically a formalization of what happens anyway. Either there's a formal process that's (hopefully) somewhat transparent to deal with disruptive people or there isn't and there's only frustration from being ignored and banned and muted by individuals and the same conversations happen in back rooms instead. There's not going to be a material change in outcome for a CoC done right (though it can definitely be done wrong), there's only more transparency and formalism.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience of the LDK code of conduct, @TheBlueMatt is the perfect example of someone who does not understand how “conflict of interests” apply to moderators too. For everyone transparency, my access to LDK is blocked since I raised strong observations on Matt's development style [here](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2620#discussion_r1341872253). If you’re tired to have people pointing flaws in your code and you’re under pressure of your own employer to respect _commercial deadlines_ this is _so easy_ to masquerade this as a Code of Conduct infringement. \r\n\r\n> At the same time, this is open source and no one is obligated to work with you. You could be a genius super coder, but be a complete asshole that is hard to work with, and it is everyone's right to decide to never speak with you. Being good at something doesn't give you the right to force everyone to listen to you.\r\n\r\n@achow101 If you’re not able to bear with the current pressure of being a maintainer you can resign from your admin rights or open the discussion to have more people vetted with spam management rights if the task is too much demanding. Blocking someone GH account won’t prevent to have _sound_ technical arguments address on another communication interface in an automatic fashion.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think this is a discussion better to be held at one of the next Coredev editions, or with wide consensus ecosystem.",
