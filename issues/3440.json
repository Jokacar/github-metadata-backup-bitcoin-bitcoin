    "title": "[RFC] Post-0.9 modularization",
    "body": "I would like to propose modularization of Bitcoin Core. This will make it easier for different people to to experiment with and implement different features without over-burdening the basic code.\n\nThe main code will only consist of a full P2P node implementation with RPC server to control it (similar to --disable-wallet build now), which can be extended with optional modules.\n\nExample modules:\n- wallets: the current wallet, but could also be a simple read-only wallet, super-HD wallet with alternative storage, ...\n- internalminer: the current internal miner will be an optional module\n- notifications: launch a script (current), ZeroMQ (#2415), websocket (#3388), ...\n- unauthenticated HTTP REST interface (#2844), ...\n\nModules exist in their own directory and have one entry point that is called at startup that can register RPC calls, HTTP path handlers, as well as hook into certain events at startup, shutdown, or node events (through CWalletInterface).\n\nThey can do this through the 'module interface' which will replace and extend the current UI interface (in `ui_interface.h`). Like the current UI interface this will be a global structure with boost::signals.\n\nInitially all modules will be built in the bitcoin/bitcoin repository,  and which ones are built can be configured through configure flags. Which ones are initialized can be specified through bitcoind command line or bitcoin.conf.\n\nLater on, building modules externally as well as dynamic loading of modules could be added but this requires a stabilized API first (and maybe security measures like code signing).\n",

The wallets/keystores already have a few signals (currently used by the GUI), so moving these to some common interface class and letting modules know about registered/unregistered wallets would solve this\n\n@luke-jr That would be possible. A module could provide 'a way to submit commands', such as JSON-over-zeromq as alternative to the current JSON RPC HTTP server. Only the RPC command table really needs to stay in the main part, to make it possible for modules to register commands in the first place.\n",

      "body": "Not sure what the status of this is, but I think it's a very good idea.  I'm very eager to see the much-discussed ZeroMQ API integrated into the code base, and it looks like its best shot would be through this type of modular interface.\n\nTo me, having the module system entirely decoupled from the rest of the code, with JSON (or protobuf or whatever serialization) over ZeroMQ providing the interface, would offer a lot of possibilities, particularly with respect to scaling.   And it's relatively simple to extend ZeroMQ with websockets, rpc, and/or http.\n\nSo is modularization still on the table?\n",

          "body": "This pull request is in early stage but discussions could help driving this into the right direction.\n\nIt will basically remove bdb (currently not on compile level) and make use of a internal key/value store.\nLogdb (the internal key/value store) is a append only store where every key/value-frame contains a sha256 checksum all available frames. Consistency is guaranteed.\n\nThe current implementation passes all tests but has lack of recover/rewrite possibilities.\n### Why this\n- IMO BerkleyDB is oversized for a \"reference wallet implementation\". This append-only file-store could prevent from corruptions and relieves compile stress.\n- wallet flush threads are no longer required.\n- remove another dependency and get more control over our stack\n### What's next / ToDos\n- ~~add compact `Rewrite()` function (save whole memory map atomically to a clean file): this is required after encrypting the wallet~~ (added 2015/01/22)\n- add thread safe / concurrency tests for logdb\n- add `Recover()` function: scan through a corrupt wallet file and try to recover keys even when some key/value-frames and/or checksums are corrupted\n- add more tests\n-   add wallet encryption test \n\n---\n\nThis is on my internal roadmap:\n- > remove bdb\n- transform account to labels\n- implement bip32\n- add spv mode\n",

This might lower down the amount of pull requests and issues, etc. in the bitcoin-core repository.\n### Planed transition/features:\n- Decouple wallet from bitcoin core, remove wallets `#ifdef ENABLE_WALLET` and implement a startup command to run bitcoin core with a/the new wallet or the legacy wallet (`-addmodule=wallet` or `-addmodule=legacywallet`, or `-addmodule=wallet,internalminer`) #5752, #5758, #5744\n- Keep the legacywallet as untouched as possible\n- Add a new BDB free wallet with a internal append only data format (logdb) (this could also be the starting point of a new wallet module). Support a migration tool.  #5686\n- Remove accounting system (new wallet only) or transform it into labels #3816\n- Add support for Bip32/HDWallets\n- Add SPV mode\n- Add multiwallet support\n### Status\n- Currently the legacywallet decoupling is the main focus. See #5752, #5758, #5744, #5745\n- The planed internal append only file format has been proven to work in #5686\n- HTTP/RPC Server: #5677 (which is related somehow)\n### Related Discussions\n#3882 Split off wallet to seperate repository\n#3440 Post-0.9 modularization\n\n---\n\nIf someone is interested in contributing, it would mainly help to **review and test the PRs listed above**. Of course delivering implementation would also be great, just make sure to speak up in a comment and make others aware of what your are working on.\n\nAs usual, the bottleneck will be testing and reviewing. Especially the unspectacular changes which not directly lead to a feature like bip32 or spv at first sight.\n\nConceptional ideas are also very much welcomed.\n",

API client developers can choose to either:\n> - develop against the latest one (committing themselves to maintain the application protecting it from eventual API changes that might break their badly designed API client).\n> - bind to a specific version of the API (which becomes apparent) but only for a limited time\n\nFrom http://stackoverflow.com/a/398564\n\nUnfortunately there is no standard when it comes to REST API versioning, but the way it's recommended in this Stackoverflow post makes sense to me.\n\n@jonasschnelli brought up that since Bitcoin Core itself isn't version 1.0 people don't expect a stable REST API. Hard to say if that is the case, but since it's definitely widely used it don't think we should break backwards compatibility too easily. And those who don't want / need it can use the first option.\n",

          "body": "## Goals\r\n\r\nSplitting up the GUI (and splitting out modules in general) has been brought up often in recent years. Now that the GUI is primarily connected through interfaces with a bitcoin node, it seems an appropriate time to revive this discussion.\r\n\r\nBefore looking for solutions, we should define a set of goals that we want to achieve. I will start with some ideas to get started and I hope that others will chime in to share and prioritize their goals.\r\n\r\n### Separate issue and patch management\r\n\r\nIt is currently not possible to subscribe to only a subset of modules in Bitcoin Core, or exclude modules from issue and patch notifications. While it is possible to reactively mute conversations in the stream of all ongoing discussions, there is no way to proactively achieve this. Moreover, the list of open issues and pull request will always include GUI related ones by default. Only with [filters](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+-label%3AGUI) it is possible to hide them.\r\n\r\n### More focused review and interests\r\n\r\nLong term goals of the GUI are partially unclear #17395 . Bitcoin Core developers are generally fluent on the command line. Thus, they might not be interested or motivated to review improvements to the GUI, which might not affect their workflow on the command line at all.  Splitting up the GUI will hopefully attract similar minded people to a project whose primary goal is to build and improve the GUI.\r\n\r\n### Maintain high quality assurance\r\n\r\nThe quality of the GUI (and even more importantly Bitcoin Core in general) must not degrade. This means that code review itself is not negatively affected by splitting the GUI, but also the integration of the GUI into the rest of Bitcoin Core. One issue could arise when arbitrary version-combinations are allowed. We are struggling hard to test against all supported versions of Boost. Making the GUI version another dimension is going to make testing impossible.\r\n\r\n### The GUI *is* Bitcoin Core\r\n\r\nWhen a user downloads Bitcoin Core from our website (or another package manager) they expect the GUI to be included. This should not change (at least not as a result of splitting up the GUI into another project).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when building Bitcoin Core, the gui should still be built when `--with-gui` is specified.",

          "title": "doc: Separate repository for the gui",
          "body": "## 🥅 Goals\r\n\r\nSplitting up the GUI (and splitting out modules in general) has been brought up often in recent years. Now that the GUI is primarily connected through (internal) interfaces with the node, it seems an appropriate time to revive this discussion.\r\n\r\nBefore looking for solutions, we should define a set of goals that we want to achieve. I will start with some ideas to get started and I hope that others will chime in to share and prioritize their goals.\r\n\r\n### Separate issue and patch management\r\n\r\nIt is currently not possible to subscribe to only a subset of modules in Bitcoin Core, or exclude modules from issue and patch notifications. While it is possible to reactively mute conversations in the stream of all ongoing discussions, there is no way to proactively achieve this. Moreover, the list of open issues and pull request will always include GUI related ones by default. Only with [filters](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+-label%3AGUI) it is possible to hide them.\r\n\r\n### More focused review and interests\r\n\r\nLong term goals of the GUI are partially unclear #17395 . Bitcoin Core developers are generally fluent on the command line. Thus, they might not be interested or motivated to review improvements to the GUI, which might not affect their workflow on the command line at all.  Splitting up the GUI will hopefully attract similar minded people to a project whose primary goal is to build and improve the GUI.\r\n\r\n### Maintain high quality assurance\r\n\r\nThe quality of the GUI (and even more importantly Bitcoin Core in general) must not degrade. This means that code review itself is not negatively affected by splitting the GUI, but also the integration of the GUI into the rest of Bitcoin Core. One issue could arise when arbitrary version-combinations are allowed. We are struggling hard to test against all supported versions of Boost. Making the GUI version another dimension is going to make testing impossible.\r\n\r\n### The GUI *is* Bitcoin Core\r\n\r\nWhen a user downloads Bitcoin Core from our website (or another package manager) they expect the GUI to be included. This should not change (at least not as a result of splitting up the GUI into another project).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when building Bitcoin Core, the gui should still be built when `--with-gui` is specified.\r\n\r\n## 🌳 Proposed solution: Monotree\r\n\r\nTLDR. Everything stays the same, the development process for the GUI changes slightly.\r\n\r\nLong version:\r\n* An exact mirror of the master development branch is hosted at `bitcoin-core/gui`. The new repository is used to track gui-only issues and pull requests. Global changes that happen to touch gui code still go to the *main* repo.\r\n* All pull requests will be merged into `bitcoin/bitcoin`.\r\n* Decision making process and maintainers will be identical for both repos.\r\n\r\n### Disadvantages\r\n\r\n* Review activity might decrease?\r\n\r\n* It doesn't go far enough. bitcoin/bitcoin#3440 is proposing a modularized Bitcoin Core. The GUI could be an \"add-on\", connected over RPC or capnproto (bitcoin/bitcoin#10102). Thus, the gui could even be hosted as a subtree or completely separate project.\r\n\r\n### Advantages\r\n\r\n* Review activity might increase? It is impossible to predict the future, but for example the `libsecp256k1` subtree has a lot of domain specific experts, maintainers and reviewers. I think longer term it makes sense to at least try this route for the gui as well.\r\n\r\n* A smaller step is easier to undo when it turns out to come with any unforeseen downsides.\r\n\r\n* No substantial changes to the decision making progress.\r\n\r\n* Nothing changes in how developers set up their dev environment or how users build from the source. Also, the release binaries and process will stay exactly the same. No version drift. Finally, code sharing between the GUI and Bitcoin Core is not made any harder.\r\n\r\n* The organizational side. There are 72 open issues (~14%) and 61 open PRs (~16%) with the GUI label. If moved to its own repo, non-GUI developers wouldn't have to be distracted with GUI-only issues and PRs and GUI enhancements. GUI developers have their own repo to focus on GUI development exclusively.\r\n\r\n### Implementation (outstanding TODOs)\r\n\r\n* Adjust maintainer merge script https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools/pull/57\r\n* Create bitcoin-core/gui repository (empty or with master branch only)\r\n* Assign all existing bitcoin core maintainers to the new repo\r\n* Celebrate? :partying_face:\r\n\r\n* Long-term: Think how long the grace period is for existing GUI related issues and pull requests. Issues can be transferred with a script after a grace period of some months?",
