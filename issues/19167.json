      "body": "I wanted to sync a full, non-pruned node on to an Apple Time Capsule storage drive. Thought solving this issue might be useful for others as well. But I hit a wall. Here are my notes in case it's useful for the next person who gets interested in this issue:\r\n\r\n- bitcoind creates a .lock file on datadir\r\n- This is done using the `fcntl` sys call\r\n- Sidenote: Filesystem locks in unix are advisory only. They only really protected against other instances of well-behaved applications. Advisory file locks are made by the OS keeping track of a pid that currently holds the lock. This is more involved over NAS storage because the lock-holding process can be on other network computers as well.\r\n- Apple Time Capsule uses AFP(Apple Filing Protocol) over TCP and `fcntl` does not seem to work as expected.\r\n- Changing the code to use the `is_wsl` workaround in `src/fs.cpp FileLock::TryLock` for AFP allows bitcoind to capture the lock using the `flock` syscall instead of `fcntl`. However, then it seems that the lock is simply ignored by another well-behaved bitcoind process.\r\n- Further down the execution path, leveldb is unable to acquire locks as well. This is likely also because of a similar issue but changing leveldb is likely more involved in time.\r\n- I decided to give up on this approach to run a full node.",

          "title": "wallet: Add sqlite as an alternative wallet database and use it for new descriptor wallets",
          "body": "This PR adds a new class `SQLiteDatabase` which is a subclass of `WalletDatabase`. This provides access to a SQLite database that is used to store the wallet records. To keep compatibility with BDB and to complexity of the change down, we don't make use of many SQLite's features. We use it strictly as a key-value store. We create a table `main` which has two columns, `key` and `value` both with the type `blob`.\r\n\r\nFor new descriptor wallets, we will create a `SQLiteDatabase` instead of a `BerkeleyDatabase`. There is no requirement that all SQLite wallets are descriptor wallets, nor is there a requirement that all descriptor wallets be SQLite wallets. This allows for existing descriptor wallets to work as well as keeping open the option to migrate existing wallets to SQLite.\r\n\r\nWe keep the name `wallet.dat` for SQLite wallets. We are able to determine which database type to use by searching for specific magic bytes in the `wallet.dat` file. SQLite begins it's files with a null terminated string `SQLite format 3`. BDB has `0x00053162` at byte 12 (note that the byte order of this integer depends on the system endianness). So when we see that there is a `wallet.dat` file that we want to open, we check for the magic bytes to determine which database system to use.\r\n\r\nI decided to keep the `wallet.dat` naming to keep things like backup script to continue to function as they won't need to be modified to look for a different file name. It also simplifies a couple of things in the implementation and the tests as `wallet.dat` is something that is specifically being looked for. If we don't want this behavior, then I do have another branch which creates `wallet.sqlite` files instead, but I find that this direction is easier.",
