I don't see a reason why regtest should produce addresses that can be confused with testnet.\r\n\r\nReasons:\r\n\r\n* It introduces additional complexity. And therefore  good reasons to actually introduce such distinction should be given, and not good reasons not to introduce it. What practical problems does having this distinction solve?\r\n* For good or bad, the existing address formats were the same on testnet vs regtest. There is a lot of existing code out there that expect no difference between tesnets and regtests addresses. Such distinction breaks some long established assumptions.\r\n* It creates confusion. Many places are not even mentioning this prefix when listing details of bech32. Example: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/List_of_address_prefixes . From what I've discovered in the discussion above, not even [BIP-173](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki) mentions it. :confused: \r\n*  (I think,) the reason to have distinction between mainnet and testnet is to protect end users from making mistakes by confusing them, which could lead to losing real mainnet bitcoin. Such confusion between regtest and testnet is benign. Protecting users from loosing testnet coins on regtest, or tegtest coins on testnet is pointless.\r\n* One way to test complex systems integrating Bitcoin, is to swap a normal node with a regtest node, and manually drive it to exercise certain scenarios (say: reorgs) and drive the block creation much faster than a real testnet/mainnet (so your test suite can finish quickly). That was all great before, but now with this change the \"compex system\" under test has to be altered (possibly in many places) just to make it support another \"network\". A network that is exactly like testnet network, but with one little difference that does not seem to have much reason to exist in the first place.\r\n\r\nThere is still not too late to get rid of `bcrt`. It's not a consensus change (since regtests are in consensus with themselves anyway), and I doubt anyone would miss it.",

      "body": "I think part of the issue here is the question whether regtest is an internal Bitcoin Core thing, or a framework for testing infrastructure on top.\n\nHistorically at least, regtest was purely an internal thing for Bitcoin Core's own tests. There is no standardization, and it has undergone rule changes several times whenever it was convenient.\n\nOn the other hand, testnet was explicitly designed for applications to test integration with, is dealt with in BIPs, though I can see why it may be hard to use in some cases.\n\nI don't know what the solution is. I'm opposed to adding regtest specifications to BIPs in general, as this would make it harder to adapt to changes that need testing in Core itself. We could consider changing the regtest prefix to something else; I don't think it's a strong reduction in test capability.\n\nOverall, the expectation of using regtest externally may bite us again in other situations. Maybe we need even more networks? (signet comes to mind, though global networks aren't what you always need either).",

      "body": "@sipa I guess I can use this opportunity to share some thought of nature of Bitcoin \"nets\" from my experiences at Bitgo (thought are mine though). Please excuse if it is a bit scattered and random.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### I'll start with the main point:\r\n\r\nOn the IDs, hashes, addresses, etc. level there's no reason to make any distinctions between testnet, regtest, simnet or whatever other non-mainnets. Conceptually the are just two types of networks: real one, and not real one. Mostly for the end user not to ever get confused. If the software needs to know if it is running against testnet vs regtest vs simnet, it can carry that information out of band - that's not a problem. It doesn't have to be embedded in every single address. Quite the opposite: having to potentially come up with additional logic in every single piece of code handling Bitcoin, to support every type of \"net\" that we could come up with is just a hindrance.\r\n\r\n#### General perspective on nets:\r\n\r\nThere's mainnet - the real deal. Everybody understands mainnet.\r\n\r\nThen there's a testnet. What's not-obvious is that testnet is not a test network for companies integrating Bitcoin. It's a test network for end users of Bitcoin. It's global, shared and behaves almost exactly like a mainnet, so users can do testing of the whole ecosystem, send funds between different companies and so on. From the perspective of a company that integrates with Bitcoin, testnet is actually what I call a \"prod-net\" - production network, exposed to end users. When testnet systems are having problems, users report normal support cases to get it fixed, just like a mainnet prod systems.\r\n\r\nTestnet is also not really suitable for Bitcoin integration testing. It is just too slow and does not give enough control. Any practical yet extensive test suite needs to have an ability to control mining and what exactly goes on the block. Regtest is perfect for that. I don't know if it was intended for it or not, but in practice it works great.\r\n\r\nRegtest node is not a mock, fake or whatever. It's a real Bitcoin Core node. From an outside perspective of a blockchain data consumer it looks very much like a normal testnet node. But you can drive it manually like a mock. You can setup a test instance of your whole system, swap a node for a regtest node, drive it with rpc commands in your test suite and see if what comes in and out is what you expect. You don't have to wait for blocks being mined, and you can simulate stuff like reorgs. Consensus with anyone else irrelevant, because there's no way to coordinate anyway.",

We can't guarantee that regtest won't undergo radical changes as our test needs change. This makes me wonder if we shouldn't define a standard \"external regtest\" network instead, with an intention if it being as close as possible to testnet (or mainnet?) as possible while remaining usable for testing.\r\n\r\nPS: why 'tb' and not 'bc'?

This makes me wonder if we shouldn't define a standard \"external regtest\" network instead\r\n\r\nAt least from our perspective, anything like this works. We can pass different flags, change config, etc. That would be a local change, and not introduce any work downstream of the rpc interface.\r\n\r\nI could imagine, that in the future there could be a mode even more tailored to external integration testing, separate from `regtest`, but as things are right now it's not really neccessary. I realize that the reward schedule is different on regtest, and probably things like difficulty, but these are not very important - a downstream service just takes the data returned by Bitcoin Core at its face value, and is not in the business of second guessing the consensus rules. If Bitcoin Core says the coinbase tx had a  25 BTC coinbase output at height 50, then that's what must have really happened.\r\n\r\n> PS: why 'tb' and not 'bc'? Regtest is closer to mainnet than to testnet in many aspects.\r\n\r\nSeems that testing against \"testnet\" is the most natural. If someone has any sort of service that needs additional testing APIs etc. they will turn such things on in the configs of their non-production env. which would typically be a regtest/testnet.\r\n",

Regtest is closer to mainnet than to testnet in many aspects.\r\n\r\nWe just really need to distinguish mainnet from testing funds, and regtest is not mainnet. :)\r\nRegnet is expedient to test e.g. behaviour around confirmations, channel open and closes, and making indexers safe through chainforks. I'd actually bet that a ton of other Bitcoin projects use regtest for some controlled environment end-to-end tests.",

This makes me wonder if we shouldn't define a standard \"external regtest\" network instead, with an intention if it being as close as possible to testnet (or mainnet?) as possible while remaining usable for testing.\r\n\r\nWe include regtest \"hardforks\" and other breaking changes in the release notes (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.16.0.md#testing-changes or https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.19.0.1.md#tests), so I think regtest is already meant to be also used externally.",

(**Update**: I now think it is a good idea.)\r\n\r\nCurrently...\r\n`LegacyAddress` (Base58) supports encoding two network types in an address: `MAINNET` and `TESTNET`\r\n`SegwitAddress` (Bech32) supports encoding three network types in an address: `MAINNET`,  `TESTNET`, and `REGTEST`.\r\n\r\nThe current code in `SegwitAddress.fromBech32(Net*, String)` will (probably?) throw an exception if given a RegTest Segwit address string. This is because `Networks.networks` contains the two entries for the networks supported by `LegacyAddress`.\r\n\r\nThis PR maps the network types that can't really be encoded into an address string into the type that a mapping from string to address would give. This might be considered a change in behavior. Although the existing behavior is a little strange.\r\n\r\nThis PR depends upon PR #2612, but would be DRAFT anyways because its main purpose is to start a discussion.",
