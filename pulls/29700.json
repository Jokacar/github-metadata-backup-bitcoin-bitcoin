    "body": "Return util::Result objects from all functions that can trigger fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThere are many validation functions that handle failures by calling `AbortNode` and triggering shutdowns, without returning error information to their callers. This makes error handling in libbitcoinkernel application code difficult, because the only way to handle these errors is to register for [notification callbacks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/kernel/notifications_interface.h). Improve this by making all functions that trigger fatal errors return util::Result objects with the error information.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a pure refactoring that returns extra result information from functions without changing their behavior. It's a possible alternative to and subset of #29642, which adds similar return information but also makes behavior changes and exposes a FatalError type.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #25665.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`3ce52fc00a0d` refactor, kernel: Add FlushStatus / FlushResult types](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/3ce52fc00a0d405f006f2e300298ac5e8691546a)\r\n- [`c6bdac1320a2` refactor: Add InfoType field to util::Result](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/c6bdac1320a2de9cd6b4caaa12e5c08e7e7d6723)\r\n- [`e56a36cc7587` refactor, blockstorage: Return FlushResult from flush methods](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/e56a36cc7587610e5dc4cd2a75951b8505c978be)\r\n- [`abd7d3622abc` refactor, blockstorage: Return fatal errors from block writes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/abd7d3622abc3471892549d44432b1a04f10653e)\r\n- [`2c2134443ccf` refactor, blockstorage: Return fatal error from LoadBlockIndex](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/2c2134443ccf2d0b131ce93358c1cfc974f0bbd2)\r\n- [`dceb837707b1` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from FlushStateToDisk](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/dceb837707b1e3b5d6a1a9e8b03a6330b07a79df)\r\n- [`1acf496ebf82` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from mempool accept functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/1acf496ebf821b75d22e1e2de8dd1e254902f8d1)\r\n- [`a39b2cdf4a80` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from assumeutxo snapshot functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/a39b2cdf4a808672b5233f960e881479a0bfad65)\r\n- [`809970373cf5` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from block connect functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/809970373cf53023e79607a9ce8154ce3ac8f330)\r\n- [`901ccdc42910` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from activate best chain functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/901ccdc429105925ed861ab01524c15dce3a6d86)\r\n- [`bbb8fec91d37` refactor, validation: Return fatal errors from new block functions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/bbb8fec91d37e74bd875ac6c8399cb9c2bee2ea7)\r\n- [`1e29b2eaaff4` refactor, blockstorage: Return fatal error from ImportBlocks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/1e29b2eaaff4b09c0e7db2d5f6d1c4c2147440b6)\r\n- [`f65fa8c91130` refactor, validation: Return more errors from VerifyDB](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700/commits/f65fa8c91130931713848a97606d5add0fc9b8c5)",

          "title": "kernel: Handle fatal errors through return values",
          "body": "Based on #25665.\r\n\r\nCurrently functions issuing fatal errors call the `fatalError` notification method to issue a shutdown procedure. This makes it hard for higher level functions to figure out if an error deeper in the call stack occurred. For users of the kernel it might also be difficult to assert which function call issued a fatal error if they are being run concurrently. If the kernel would eventually be used by external users, getting fatal error information through a callback instead of function return values would also be cumbersome and limiting. Unit, bench, and fuzz tests currently don't have a way to effectively test against fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThis patch set is an attempt to make fatal error handling in the kernel code more transparent. Fatal errors are now passed up the call stack through `util::Result<T, FatalError>` failure values. A previous attempt at this by theuni always immediately returned failure values if a function call returned a failure. However, this is not always desirable (see discussion [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27866#discussion_r1256378064)). Sometimes, further operations can still be completed even if a fatal error was issued. The solution to this is that these \"ignored\" errors are still moved through `util::Result`'s error string values with its `.MoveMessages` method, even while a failure value in the result is not present.\r\n\r\nNext to some smaller behavior changes, the most significant change is that the issuing of a shutdown procedure is delayed until a potential fatal error is handled as opposed to immediately when it is first encountered. Another effect is that potential fatal errors are now asserted in the bench, fuzz and unit tests. Some of the currently not immediately returned fatal errors need some further scrutiny. These are marked with a `TODO (fatal error)` comment and could be tackled in a later PR.\r\n\r\nTo validate this approach a new clang-tidy check is introduced. It implements the following checks:\r\n\r\n1. If a function calls another function with a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` return type, its return type has to be `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` too, or it has to handle the value returned by the function with one of `CheckFatal`, `HandleFatalError`,\r\n`UnwrapFatalError`, or `CheckFatalFailure`.\r\n2. In functions returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` a call to a function returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` needs to propagate the value by either:\r\n   - Returning it immediately\r\n   - Assigning it immediately to an existing result with `.MoveMessages()` or `.Set()`\r\n   - Eventually passing it as an argument to a `.MoveMessages()`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587) and is a step towards stage 2, creating a more refined kernel API.",

          "body": "This adds a height parameter to the `dumptxoutset` RPC. This internalizes the workflow that was previously done by scripts: roll back the chain to the height we actually want the snapshot from, create the snapshot, roll forward to the real tip again.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about internalizing this functionality is that we can write tests for the code and it gives us more options to make the functionality robust. The shell scripts we have so far will be more cumbersome to maintain in the long run, especially since we will only notice later when we have broken them. I think it's safe to remove these `test_utxo_snapshots.sh` as well when we have this option in `dumptxoutset` because we have also added some good additional functional test coverage for this functionality.",

          "title": "Broadcast own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections",
          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

          "body": "Since https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17487 we no longer need to clear the coins cache when syncing to disk. A warm coins cache significantly speeds up block connection, and only needs to be fully flushed when nearing the `dbcache` limit.\r\n\r\nFor frequent pruning flushes there's no need to empty the cache and kill connect block speed. However, simply using `Sync` in place of `Flush` actually slows down a pruned full IBD with a high `dbcache` value. This is because as the cache grows, sync takes longer since every coin in the cache is scanned to check if it's dirty. For frequent prune flushes and a large cache this constant scanning starts to really slow IBD down, and just emptying the cache on every prune becomes faster.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we can add two pointers to each cache entry and construct a doubly linked list of dirty entries. We can then only iterate through all dirty entries on each `Sync`, and simply clear the pointers after.\r\n\r\nWith this approach a full IBD with `dbcache=16384` and `prune=550` was 32% faster than master. For default `dbcache=450` speedup was ~9%. All benchmarks were run with `stopatheight=800000`.\r\n\r\n|  | prune | dbcache | time | max RSS | speedup |\r\n|-----------:|----------:|------------:|--------:|-------------:|--------------:|\r\n| master | 550 | 16384 | 8:52:57 | 2,417,464k | - |\r\n| branch | 550 | 16384 | 6:01:00 | 16,216,736k | 32% |\r\n| branch | 550 | 450 | 8:05:08 | 2,818,072k | 8.8% |\r\n| master | 10000 | 5000 | 8:19:59 | 2,962,752k | - |\r\n| branch | 10000 | 5000| 5:56:39 | 6,179,764k | 28.8% |\r\n| master | 0 | 16384 | 4:51:53 | 14,726,408k | - |\r\n| branch | 0 | 16384 | 4:43:11 | 16,526,348k | 2.7% |\r\n| master | 0 | 450 | 7:08:07 | 3,005,892k | - |\r\n| branch | 0 | 450 | 6:57:24 | 3,013,556k |2.6%|\r\n\r\nWhile the 2 pointers add memory to each cache entry, it did not slow down IBD. For non-pruned IBD results were similar for this branch and master. A non-pruned IBD with full `dbcache` to tip ended up using 12% more memory, but it was also 2.7% faster somehow. For smaller `dbcache` values the `dbcache` limit is respected so does not consume more memory, and the potentially more frequent flushes were not significant enough to cause any slowdown.\r\n\r\nInspired by [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15265#issuecomment-457720636).\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11315.",

          "body": "Since https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17487 we no longer need to clear the coins cache when syncing to disk. A warm coins cache significantly speeds up block connection, and only needs to be fully flushed when nearing the `dbcache` limit.\r\n\r\nPeriodic flushes occur every 24 hours, which empties the cache and causes block connection to slow down. By keeping the cache through periodic flushes a node can run for several days with an increasingly hotter cache and connect blocks much more quickly. Now not only can setting a higher `dbcache` value be beneficial for IBD, it can also be beneficial for connecting blocks faster.\r\n\r\nTo benchmark in real world usage, I spun up 6 identical `t2.small` AWS EC2 instances, all running in the same region in the same VPC. I configured 2 instances to run master, 2 instances to run the change in this PR, and 2 instances to run the change in this PR but with `dbcache=1000`. All instances had `prune=5000` and a 20 GB `gp2` `EBS` volume. A 7th EC2 instance in the same VPC ran master and connected only to some trusted nodes in the outside network. Each of the 6 nodes under test only connected directly to this 7th instance. I manually pruned as much as possible and uploaded the same `blocks`, `chainstate` and `mempool.dat` to all instances. I started all 6 peers simultaneously at block height `835245` and ran them for over a week until block `836534`.\r\n\r\nThe results were much faster block connection times for this branch compared to master, and much faster for this branch with `dbcache=1000` compared to default `dbcache`.\r\n\r\n|  branch |speed |\r\n|-----------:|----------:|\r\n| master 1 | 1995.49ms/blk |\r\n| master 2 | 2129.78ms/blk |\r\n| branch default dbcache 1 | 1189.65ms/blk |\r\n| branch default dbcache 2 | 1037.74ms/blk |\r\n| branch dbcache=1000 1 | 393.69ms/blk |\r\n| branch dbcache=1000 2 | 427.77ms/blk |\r\n\r\nThe log files of all 6 instances are [here](https://gist.github.com/andrewtoth/03c95033e7581d5dbc5be028639a1a91).\r\nThere is a lot of noise with the exact times of blocks being connected, so I plotted the rolling 20 block connect time averages. The large dots are the times where the cache is emptied. For the red master nodes, this happens every 24 hours. The blue branch nodes with default `dbcache` only filled up and emptied the caches once, which is seen in the middle. The green branch nodes with 1000 `dbcache` never emptied the cache. It is very clear from the chart that whenever the cache is emptied, connect block speed degrades significantly.\r\n\r\n![plot](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/237213/802cb28d-1ad4-47c3-a886-c5366b423eca)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso note that this still clears the cache for pruning flushes. Having frequent pruning flushes with a large cache that doesn't clear is less performant than the status quo https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15265#issuecomment-458657451. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28280.",

          "body": "Currently, if the tracepoints are compiled (e.g. in depends and release builds), we always prepare the tracepoint arguments regardless of the tracepoints being used or not. We made sure that the argument preparation is as cheap as possible, but we can almost completely eliminate any overhead for users not interested in the tracepoints (the vast majority), by gating the tracepoint argument preparation with an `if(something is attached to this tracepoint)`. To achieve this, we use the optional semaphore feature provided by SystemTap.\r\n\r\nThe first commit simplifies and deduplicates our tracepoint macros from 13 TRACEx macros to a single TRACEPOINT macro. This makes them easier to use and also avoids more duplicate macro definitions in the second commit.\r\n\r\nThe Linux tracing tools I'm aware of (bcc, bpftrace, libbpf, and systemtap) all support the semaphore gating feature. Thus, all existing tracepoints and their argument preparation is gated in the second commit. For details, please refer to the commit messages and the updated documentation in `doc/tracing.md`.\r\n\r\nAlso adding unit tests that include all tracepoint macros to make sure there are no compiler problems with them (e.g. some varadiac extension not supported). \r\n\r\nReviewers might want to check:\r\n- Do the tracepoints still work for you? Do the examples in `contrib/tracing/` run on your system (as bpftrace frequently breaks on every new version, please test master too if it should't work for you)? Do the CI interface tests still pass?\r\n- Is the new documentation clear? \r\n- The `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE(event, context)` macros places global variables in our global namespace. Is this something we strictly want to avoid or maybe move to all `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE`s to a separate .cpp file or even namespace? I like having the `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE()` in same file as the `TRACEPOINT()`, but open for suggestion on alternative approaches. \r\n- Are newly added tracepoints in the unit tests visible when using `readelf -n /src/test/test_bitcoin`? You can run the new unit tests with `./src/test/test_bitcoin --run_test=util_trace_tests* --log_level=all`.\r\n<details><summary>Two of the added unit tests demonstrate that we are only processing the tracepoint arguments when attached by having a test-failure condition in the tracepoint argument preparation.

Instead of needing to be deferenced twice with `**result` or `(*result)->member`, it only needs to be dereferenced once with `*result` or `result->member`. Also when it is used in a boolean context, instead of evaluating to true when there is no error and the pointer is null, it evaluates to false so it is straightforward to determine whether the result points to something.\r\n\r\nThis PR is only partial a solution to #26004 because while it makes it easier to check for null pointer values, it does not make it impossible to return a null pointer value inside a successful result. It would be possible to enforce that successful results always contain non-null pointers by using a `not_null` type (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24423) in combination with `ResultPtr`, though.\r\n",

          "title": "refactor: Add util::Result failure values, multiple error and warning messages",
          "body": "Add `util::Result` support for returning more error information and make use of it in [LoadChainstate method](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665/commits/93af79a1aae9ad483e8ee38ad63f0256464e7153) as an initial application. Followup PR [#25722](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25722) uses it more broadly to return errors and warnings from wallet loading functions as well.\r\n\r\nThis change adds two major features to the result class:\r\n\r\n- For better error handling, adds the ability to return a value on failure, not just a value on success. This is a key missing feature that makes the result class not useful for functions like `LoadChainstate()` which produce different errors that need to be handled differently [^1].\r\n\r\n[^1]: Ability to return error values was actually present in the original implementation of [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218), but unfortunately removed in later iterations.\r\n\r\n- For better error reporting, adds the ability to return warning messages and multiple errors, not just a single error string. This provides a way for functions to report errors and warnings in a standard way, and simplifies interfaces:\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -virtual std::unique_ptr<Wallet> loadWallet(const std::string& name, bilingual_str& error, std::vector<bilingual_str>& warnings) = 0;\r\n    +virtual util::Result<std::unique_ptr<Wallet>> loadWallet(const std::string& name) = 0;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options, DatabaseStatus& status, bilingual_str& error);\r\n    +util::Result<std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase>, DatabaseError> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options);\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThis change also makes some more minor improvements:\r\n\r\n- Smaller type size. `util::Result<int>` is 16 bytes, and `util::Result<void>` is 8 bytes. Previously both were 72 bytes.\r\n\r\n- Broader type compatibility. Supports noncopyable and nonmovable success and error types.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives & design notes\r\n\r\nThe main goal for the `util::Result` class is to provide a standard way for functions to report error and warnings strings. The interface tries to make it easy to provide detailed error feedback to end users, without cluttering code or making it harder to return other result information. There have been multiple iterations of the design using different internal representations and providing different capabilities:\r\n\r\n|   | Representation (approximate)                   | Notes |\r\n|---|------------------------------------------------|-------|\r\n| _1_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Original #25218 implementation in da98fd2efc1a6b9c6e876cf3e227a8c2e9a10827. Good capabilities, but larger type size. Supports error standardized error reporting and customized error handling with failure values. |\r\n| _2_ | `variant<T,bilingual_str>`                | Final #25218 implementation in 7a45c33d1f8a758850cf8e7bd6ad508939ba5c0d. No support for returning failure values so not useful in many cases.\r\n| _3_ | `variant<monostate,T,F>`                 | Pending #25601 implementation that allows choosing whether to use standardized error reporting or return custom failure values, but doesn't support having both at the same time, like approaches _(1)_, _(4)_, _(5)_, _(6)_ do. |\r\n | _4_ | `tuple<variant<T,F>,bilingual_str>`      | Original #25608 implementation in c29d3008de9314dd463ed08e8bff39fe55324498. Basically the same as _(1)_ except it uses separate success and failure types instead of the same type. Using separate success and failure types makes the result class a little less flexible but can help avoid some ambiguity and inconsistent result states. |\r\n| _5_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Final #25608 implementation in dd91f294206ac87b213d23bb76656a0a5f0f4781. Essentially the same as original implementation _(1)_ except has some usability improvements. |\r\n| _6_ | `tuple<T,unique_ptr<tuple<F,bilingual_str>>` | Pending #25665 implementation (this PR). Supports returning failure values, uses separate success and failure types to avoid ambiguity, uses `unique_ptr` to reduce result type size, and avoids heap allocation in the happy path. |\r\n\r\n### Prior discussions & history\r\n\r\n- _furszy_ introduced a `BResult` class providing a standard error reporting mechanism in [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218). It was renamed to `util::Result` in [#25721](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25721) but kept the same representation and capabilities.\r\n\r\n- _MarcoFalke_ suggested using `BResult` for the `LoadChainstate` function in [#25308 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25308#issuecomment-1181674645). Inability to use `BResult` there due to lack of support for failure values led to initial work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _w0xlt_ wrote a `StructuredResult` class in [#25308](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25601) adding the ability to return failure values but sacrificing standard error reporting, which led to more work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _martinus_ suggested a space optimization in [#25608 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608#discussion_r921049409) that also made it easier to support distinct failure & success types, leading to [#25665](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665) as a replacement for [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).",

          "title": "wallet: Target a pre-defined utxo set composition by adjusting change outputs",
          "body": "This PR is designed for the use case of a Lightning node that provides liquidity of predefined amounts via [liquidity ads](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/878).\r\n\r\nCoin selection is currently optimized to reduce the size of the utxo set and create change optimized for privacy. A liquidity provider instead needs to service multiple liquidity requests by spending confirmed utxos of known sizes.\r\n\r\nIdeally most liquidity transactions would be funded by a single input or a small set of inputs optimized to reduce fees. To minimize the number of unconfirmed transactions, inputs should also be sized in a range where most transactions do not produce change. When change is created, it should be divided into outputs of the sizes needed so that the wallet's utxo set converges towards an ideal utxo set specified by the user.\r\n\r\nI am opening this PR as a draft to get feedback and suggestions on the concept and my implementation to address this use case.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm described below can be implemented externally via RPC calls or directly in the wallet. \r\n\r\n1. Externally: use a new option to set the change target used for coin selection. \r\n2. Wallet (opportunistic): a new configuration file defines the desired utxo set which the wallet uses to compute the change target used for coin selection and to split change outputs (if any). \r\n4. Wallet (reactive/proactive):  pre-select a large input to force coin selection to produce change when fees are below some specified threshold or the desired set of utxos falls below some threshold. \r\n\r\n## utxo targets file example:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"buckets\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"start_satoshis\": 10000,\r\n            \"end_satoshis\": 25000,\r\n            \"target_utxo_count\": 150\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"start_satoshis\": 50000,\r\n            \"end_satoshis\": 75000,\r\n            \"target_utxo_count\": 50\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"start_satoshis\": 200000,\r\n            \"end_satoshis\": 250000,\r\n            \"target_utxo_count\": 20\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"start_satoshis\": 1000000,\r\n            \"end_satoshis\": 1400000,\r\n            \"target_utxo_count\": 5\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"bucket_refill_feerate\": 30000\r\n}\r\n```\r\n - The `target_utxo_count` for a bucket should be larger than the anticipated number of liquidity requests of `bucket_start_satoshis` within the expected confirmation time of a liquidity transaction.\r\n - The range from `bucket_start_satoshis` to `bucket_end_satoshis` should encompass expected fee variance.\r\n - The `bucket_refill_feerate` should be set to the expected median fee rate (?).\r\n - This file will be reloaded for every spend request to allow for on-the-fly updates\r\n\r\n## Algorithm steps\r\n\r\nFor each payment do the following:\r\n\r\n1) Calculate the current capacity of each target bucket from the wallet's utxo set.\r\n    - Include outputs from both confirmed and unconfirmed transactions in the wallet to calculate capacity.\r\n2) Add our largest confirmed utxo as an input IF the capacity of the least full target bucket is below some threshold (eg. < 30% full) or less than some higher threshold (eg. < 70%) and fee rates are below the `bucket_refill_feerate`.\r\n    - When the largest confirmed utxo is from one of our target buckets, then we should refill our wallet with a utxo from cold storage.\r\n3) Set the minimum change target [`m_min_change_target`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3054416f62644120a4a6bc76e927054c7fbbd487/src/wallet/coinselection.h#L147) to a value from the target bucket with the lowest current capacity.\r\n    - Generate a random change target of the amount: current `change_fee` (the fee for creating an output) + a random value in the range: `bucket_start_satoshis` to `bucket_end_satoshi` - `change_fee`.\r\n    - Currently the change target is set by [`GenerateChangeTarget()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6ff0aa089c01ff3e610ecb47814ed739d685a14c/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L824) in a hard coded range.\r\n    - This parameter is only used by the 'knapsack' and 'coingrinder' algorithms.\r\n4) Call ['SelectCoins()'](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3054416f62644120a4a6bc76e927054c7fbbd487/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L1132) with the input from step 2 (if any) added to the `preset_inputs` parameter and with the minimum change target from step 3.\r\n    - The `consolidatefeerate=0` configuration option should always be set so that utxos are not preemptively cosolidated. Coin selection sets the parameter [`m_long_term_feerate`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/37fdf5a492786c1772b5b40773a1031237447070/src/wallet/coinselection.h#L160) to the wallets `consolidatefeerate`.\r\n    - Ideally, only the 'bnb' and 'cg' coin selection algorithms should be used and the others disabled to optimize for low fees.\r\n5) If the coin selection result includes a change output, then split the single change output amount into multiple outputs.\r\n    - Add the mimimum change target as an output first.\r\n    - If there is remaining value after paying the fee for a new output, then add a target from the next most empty target bucket.\r\n    - If there is not enough value to add a new output and fees, add remaining value to the last output added instead.\r\n\r\n",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [x] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick). [DONE, see [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/research-into-the-effects-of-a-cluster-size-limited-mempool-in-2023/794/1)]\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add duplicate transactions to the mempool (#29990).\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts.

          "body": "`SaveBlockToDisk` / `FindBlockPos` are used for two purposes, depending on whether they are called during reindexing (`dbp` set,  `fKnown = true`) or in the \"normal\" case when adding new blocks (`dbp == nullptr`,  `fKnown = false`).\r\nThe actual tasks are quite different\r\n- In normal mode, preparations for saving a new block are made, which is then saved: find the correct position on disk (maybe skipping to a new blk file), check for available disk space, update the blockfile info db, save the block.\r\n- during reindex, most of this is not necessary (the block is already on disk after all), only the blockfile info needs to rebuilt because reindex wiped the leveldb it's saved in.\r\n\r\nUsing one function with many conditional statements for this leads to code that is hard to read / understand and bug-prone:\r\n- many code paths in `FindBlockPos` are conditional on `fKnown` or `!fKnown`\r\n- It's not really clear what actually needs to be done during reindex (we don't need to \"save a block to disk\" or \"find a block pos\" as the function names suggest)\r\n- logic that should be applied to only one of the two modes is sometimes applied to both (see first commit, or #27039)\r\n\r\n#24858 and #27039 were recent bugs directly related to the differences between reindexing and normal mode, and in both cases the simple fix took a long time to be reviewed and merged.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to clean this code up by splitting out the reindex logic into a separate function (`AddToBlockFileInfo`) which will be called directly from validation. As a result, `SaveBlockToDisk` and `FindBlockPos` only need to cover the non-reindex logic. ",

          "body": "The function `GetFirstStoredBlock()` helps us find the first block for which we have data. So far this function only looked for a block with `BLOCK_HAVE_DATA`. However, this doesn't mean that we also have the undo data of that block, and undo data might be required for what a user would like to do with those blocks. One example of how this might happen is if some blocks were fetched using the `getblockfrompeer` RPC. Blocks fetched from a peer will have data but no undo data.\r\n\r\nThe first commit here allows `GetFirstStoredBlock()` to check for undo data as well by passing a parameter. This alone is useful for #29553 and I would use it there.\r\n\r\nIn the second commit I am applying the undo check to the RPCs that report `pruneheight` to the user. I find this much more intuitive because I think the user expects to be able to do all operations on blocks up until the `pruneheight` but that is not the case if undo data is missing. I personally ran into this once before and now again when testing for assumeutxo when I had used `getblockfrompeer`. The following commit adds test coverage for this change of behavior.\r\n\r\nThe last commit adds a note in the docs of `getblockfrompeer` that undo data will not be available.\r\n",
