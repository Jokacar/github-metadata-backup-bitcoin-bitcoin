    "body": "Depends on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27601, please go there first.\r\n\r\nThis work aims to define, and implement a base standard mechanism to\r\ndetect individual change outputs.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nCurrently, the wallet detects whether an output is change or not based\r\non data stored in the address book.\r\n\r\nThere is no notion of “change outputs”, the wallet detects change scripts.\r\n\r\nConnoting that any address book record modification has implications\r\non all the historical outputs related to that particular destination. Meaning\r\nthat all those outputs can either be change or not. There is no middle-ground\r\ngranular distinction.\r\n\r\n#### How Change Detection Currently Works?\r\n\r\nThe wallet walks-through the transaction outputs, extracts the script\r\ndestination and verify the following two points:\r\n\r\n1) If the destination doesn't exist in the address book, then the script\r\n    is a \"change address\".\r\n   \r\n2) If the destination exists in the address book, but it doesn't have a\r\n     label, then the script is a \"change address\".\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are a good number of problems in the current approach:\r\n\r\n- We make the wallet dependent on an external structure, with separate storage.\r\n   Which has to be updated and maintained along with the wallet state.\r\n\r\n- It cannot be maintained nor recovered across different wallet instances.\r\n   Cannot re-create the, possibly custom, address book data only by importing\r\n   the wallet descriptor string.\r\n\r\n- As the address book is an structure that the user can freely modify, the change\r\n   detection process might differ through different wallets.\r\n \r\n- The current rudimentary assumptions of \"no address book entry\" or \"no label set for the address book entry\"\r\n  to denote that certain script destination is change or not can easily be broken:\r\n  E.g. derive an address from one of the wallet’s external paths manually. Then send coins to it.\r\n  As the receive destination wasn't created inside the wallet, the wallet has no associated address book entry.\r\n  So, the reception is invalidly detected as change (added a test case for it).\r\n\r\n- The wallet can't detect change outputs on more complex scripts such as multi-sig change outputs.\r\n\r\n- The wallet is not able to detect change outputs going to an internal address if the internal address has a label.\r\n  (E.g. the user can manually set a label for the internal address and, doing that, make that all the change\r\n  outputs, in the wallet history, that were sent to the destination are no longer detected as change).\r\n\r\n- There isn’t a way to distinguish the external reception of coins into an internal address. Coins reception on any\r\n   internal address are always detected as change.\r\n\r\n### New Change Detection Mechanism Goals\r\n\r\nAiming to:\r\n\r\n* Define a base mechanism to align different wallet implementations. Preventing each piece of software\r\n  from diverging on the basic change outputs distinction.\r\n\r\n* Detect change outputs on-demand without requiring to maintain an external data structure synced with the\r\n   latest wallet state.\r\n\r\n* Independently, and accurately, detect change outputs regardless data stored in structures that the user\r\n   can freely modify.\r\n\r\n* Granular distinction between change vs non-change outputs that were sent to the same internal address.\r\n  E.g. the reception of coins, from an external source, on internal addresses will not longer be detected\r\n  as change anymore.\r\n\r\n* Expand the change detection to more complex scripts such as a multi-sig protected addresses. (While they\r\n  are added into the wallet on an internal spkm)\r\n\r\n#### Change Output Detection Rules\r\n\r\nA transaction output is change if it fulfills the following points:\r\n\r\n1) At least one of the parent transaction inputs is from the wallet. (If none of them are, then the wallet is receiving coins\r\n    on an internal address).\r\n\r\n2) The script extracted destination is from the wallet and is located in one of the internal script pub key manager.\r\n    (e.g. derived from an internal derivation path)\r\n\r\n#### What about legacy wallets?\r\n\r\nIf the legacy wallet is HD post-split, we have an internal derivation path, so we can follow the same process as\r\ndescriptors wallet. Unless the destination is on the pre-split key pool, in which case, we fallback to the follow-up\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nIf the legacy wallet is pre-split, we continue using the address book as we either have an HD wallet with keys\r\nderived only on the external path, or we are using raw keypool.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————\r\n\r\n#### Extra Note\r\nThis PR, in about 85% at least, is about expanding the current test coverage for the change output detection area.\r\n\r\n#### TO DO (still WIP):\r\n\r\n* [x] Save “internal” flag on non-active descriptors so the wallet can use them on the change detection process.\r\n   (which will fix the currently failing test cases).\r\n* [ ] Re-organize commits so tests always pass.\r\n* [ ] Verify backwards compatibility.",

Verifying and testing the current behavior before introducing the new features.\r\n\r\nThe following cases are covered:\r\n\r\n1) Two p2wpkh spending transactions with the same hash are received:\r\nThe first one with segwit data stripped, and the second one with segwit data.\r\n   \r\n   Result ->  the wallet will update the stored tx, saving the witness data.\r\n\r\n2) Two p2wsh multisig spending txes with the same hash but a different witness are received:\r\nThe first is added to the wallet via the mempool acceptance flow.\r\nwhile the second one, is added to the wallet via the block connection flow.\r\n\r\n   Result -> the wallet will NOT update the stored transaction. The first received transaction\r\nwill take precedence over any following-up transaction. Detached to the fact that the\r\noriginal transaction didn't get into a block and the second one did.\r\n\r\nExtra Note:\r\nDid it on an unit test merely because wanted to review other parts of the sources while was doing it. Could migrate it into a functional test if reviewers wants it as well.",

Please review https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26836 first.\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\n\r\nWe are currently using the address book for different purposes and features in the wallet such us:\r\n\r\n1) Store and retrieve own receive addresses with a label.\r\n2) Store and retrieve external addresses with a label.\r\n3) Store and retrieve payment requests.\r\n4) Mark addresses/destinations as 'used' if they appear on the blockchain (part of the “avoid re-use” feature).\r\n5) Know whether an output is a change or not based on the encoded script.\r\n\r\nSome of these points aren’t well known by many because this code has been spread and obfuscated across the wallet’s sources. (and created in a Frankenstein style).\r\n\r\n#### PR Goals\r\n\r\nEncapsulate the address book functionalities into its own `AddressBookManager` class, so we are able to distinguish properly the address book responsibilities and capabilities.\r\n\r\nBe able to decouple the address book dependency on the wallet’s main mutex (up to a certain point, because we are still using the same db connection).\r\n\r\nClean up the wallet sources further.\r\n\r\nBe able to unit/fuzz test the address book manager implementation isolated from the wallet flows.\r\n\r\nAnd create a new class that can be easily upgraded/replaced, and even different implementations can be used in parallel in different local wallets, by just providing a different manager instance to the wallet in the constructor.\r\n\r\n#### Next steps\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, will be working on improve the ‘change output’ flow which, at least for now, is strictly connected to this process (goal will be to remove the strict dependency).\r\n\r\n#### Pending work (still under WIP, almost there)\r\n\r\n* [ ] Add manager class description.\r\n* [ ] Clean CAddressBookData.\r\n* [ ] Cover the class with unit tests.\r\n* [ ] Double-check commits order.\r\n* [ ] Add addrbook purposes enum.\r\n* [ ] Make cs_addrbook RecursiveMutex a Mutex?\r\n",

      "body": "> Does this also fix #20935 and #20795 ?\r\n\r\nYes for the change outputs detection part. It will allow us to properly detect each individual output as change or not, independently on what is stored in the address book entry (making the process deterministic across instances, and not dependent on a data structure that the user can freely modify).\r\n\r\nAs an edge case example; with this, users could even receive coins on an internal address and the new mechanism will properly detect it as an external reception, not a change output (the transaction inputs aren't from the wallet, so no coins are returning to it). Still, this behavior is obviously not encouraged, nor should be easy to do in the wallet, as it breaks the whole idea of internal/external derivation paths.\r\n\r\nPlus, would recommend you to check [#25685](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25685) as well. The first commit there fixes a misleading wallet behavior where even if you set `add_inputs=false` (telling the wallet to disallow automatic coin selection), the wallet will still fetch coins internally and use them in the Coin Selection process (if you don't pre-set inputs manually).\r\n\r\n\r\n> > How Change Detection Currently Works?\r\n> > The wallet walks-through the transaction outputs, extracts the script\r\n> > destination and verify the following two points:\r\n> \r\n> > If the destination doesn't exist in the address book, then the script\r\n> > is a \"change address\".\r\n> \r\n> > If the destination exists in the address book, but it doesn't have a\r\n> > label, then the script is a \"change address\".\r\n> \r\n> I was assuming change address had different derivation path. Is that false?\r\n\r\nNot entirely, the assumption is most of the time correct. It breaks on pre-split legacy wallets, where we don't have an internal derivation path. In those wallet versions we (1) only use an external path to derive public and change addresses, or if we go further back in time, (2) we use a raw pool of keys with no derivation paths at all. (Thus why the initial change detection process was implemented using the address book).",

The assumption is that any\r\n    // payment to a script that is ours, but is not in the address book\r\n    // is change.\r\n\r\nI tend to put all my addresses in the address book whether I'm going to use them as change or not. I guess if the wallet was capable of creating its own SegWit change addresses I'd stop using custom change addresses, but currently it always seems to send change to a legacy address if I don't manually specify a change address.",

It relies on `m_internal_spk_managers` which only contains the currently active SPKMs. If a user were to remove a SPKM from being active, all of the addresses that were produced by that would no longer be detected as change. This is especially problematic with #25907 which rotates all of the currently active descriptors.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'm not sure that we can determine which output is change without storing additional metadata. What has been suggested before is to explicitly store an \"IsChange\" value in address book entries, with a \"smart\" fallback like what this PR does.",

Not sure about the performance implication, but if the approach is OK, caching can also be used with this solution.\r\n\r\nThis approach also fixes the bug mentioned at the end of the `wallet_abandonconflict.py` file.",

          "body": "Fixes https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/688 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26687.\r\n\r\nFirst Issue Description (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/688):\r\n\r\nThe previous behavior for `getAvailableBalance`, when the coin control had selected coins, was to return the sum of them. Instead, we are currently returning the wallet's available total balance minus the selected coins total amount.\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nMissed to update the `GetAvailableBalance` function to include the coin control selected coins on #25685.\r\n\r\nContext:\r\nSince #25685 we skip the selected coins inside `AvailableCoins`, the reason is that there is no need to waste resources walking through the entire wallet's txes map just to get coins that could have gotten by just doing a simple `mapWallet.find`).\r\n\r\nPlaces Where This Generates Issues (only when the user manually select coins via coin control):\r\n1) The GUI balance check prior the transaction creation process.\r\n2) The GUI \"useAvailableBalance\" functionality.\r\n\r\nNote 1:\r\nAs the GUI uses a balance cache since https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/598, this issue does not affect the regular spending process. Only arises when the user manually select coins.\r\n\r\nNote 2:\r\nAdded test coverage for the `useAvailableBalance` functionality.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nSecond Issue Description (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26687):\r\n\r\nAs we are using a cached balance on `WalletModel::getAvailableBalance`,\r\nthe function needs to include the watch-only available balance for wallets\r\nwith private keys disabled.\r\n",

This is especially useful when a new default descriptor has been implemented as it allows wallets created before that time to quickly and easily add that type of descriptor.\r\n\r\nIn particular, descriptor wallets created before Taproot was implemented can use the new `createwalletdescriptor` RPC in order to get a Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to keep the newly generated descriptor in line with the existing descriptors, this PR uses #26728 as it exposes a \"wallet extended key\" for us (in addition to upgrading wallets implemented prior to have a wallet xpub). The newly generated descriptors will use the \"wallet extended key\" stored in `CWallet` that PR adds.\r\n\r\n`createwalletdescriptor` is generic and so it can also be used with the other address types. Of course, it given the same wallet extended key, address type, and internal-ness, it will create the same descriptor. So some refactoring has been done in order to detect that the same descriptor is about to be created, and to avoid overwriting any existing descriptors.",

          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",

      "body": "finally here. Thanks for the input achow101\r\n\r\n> While I like the idea this is going for, I don't think it is sufficient. It relies on `m_internal_spk_managers` which only contains the currently active SPKMs. If a user were to remove a SPKM from being active, all of the addresses that were produced by that would no longer be detected as change. This is especially problematic with #25907 which rotates all of the currently active descriptors.\r\n\r\nI'm probably missing some context but.. wouldn't that be solvable by adding an `internal` field to the `WalletDescriptor` class? (32a990a). So we can keep track of non-active internal descriptors too.\r\nIt should work fine while we don't have any descriptor removal functionality (which would also mean to remove txs from the wallet etc) and require to keep historical records.\r\n\r\n> In general, I'm not sure that we can determine which output is change without storing additional metadata. What has been suggested before is to explicitly store an \"IsChange\" value in address book entries, with a \"smart\" fallback like what this PR does.\r\n\r\nI think that we should have a more granular distinction and move from \"change addresses\" to \"change outputs\". Storing any extra metadata, if needed, inside the wallet transaction class.\r\n\r\nA good use case for this is the reception of coins from an external source on internal addresses, which shouldn't be detected as change as it could be a simple reception or part of a dust attack.\r\nif the tx has no inputs belonging to the wallet, then no output should be labeled as change.",

          "body": "`listreceivedbyaddress` & `listreceivedbylabel` RPCs list balances by receiving address and label respectively. That works by creating a tally (`mapTally[address]`) from all the transaction outputs in the wallet and then cross-reference that with the address book in order to calculate which addresses received funds.\r\n\r\nIf an address is in the address book but not in the tally, it's considered empty (never received funds) and is not returned unless `include_empty=true`. That effectively means that when `include_empty=true` the entire address book is included in the result.\r\n\r\n**This creates 2 issues:**\r\n\r\n1. As reported in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16159, the address book also includes addresses with a \"send\" purpose which should not be part of the response.\r\n2. As reported in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10468, if `include_watchonly=false` [the watchonly addresses are not included in `mapTally`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fa5c224d444802dabec5841009e029b9754c92f1/src/wallet/rpc/transactions.cpp#L120-L122 ) leading to them being considered empty during the subsequent cross-reference with the address book thus becoming part of the result when `include_empty=true`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16159 by filtering-out \"send\" addresses, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16159#issuecomment-1234405923 for more details on the issue. I haven't thought of a nice solution to fix (2) yet.\r\n\r\n**Edit**: Split `wallet_listreceivedby.py` tests for code maintainability as tests for more than one RPC have been added since the creation of the file. Added test coverage for the introduced change.",

This is done in various places, such as `IsMine`, and helper functions for fetching a `ScriptPubKeyMan` and a `SolvingProvider`. This also has a bit of a performance impact on standard descriptor wallets, although less noticeable due to the small number of SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAs these functions are based on doing `IsMine` for each `ScriptPubKeyMan`, we can improve this performance by caching `IsMine` scriptPubKeys for all descriptors and use that to determine which `ScriptPubKeyMan` to actually use for those things. This cache is used exclusively and we no longer iterate the SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAlso added a benchmark for `IsMine`.",

          "body": "When replacing the outputs of a transaction during `bumpfee`, it is possible to accidentally create a transaction that will not be accepted into the mempool as it does not meet the incremental relay fee requirements. This occurs because the size estimation used for checking the provided feerate does not account for the replaced outputs; it instead uses the original outputs. When the replaced outputs is significantly different from the original, there can be a large difference in estimated transaction sizes that can make a transaction miss the absolute fee requirements for the incremental relay fee. Unfortunately we do not currently inform the user when the bumped transaction fails to relay, so they could use `bumpfee` and think the transaction has been bumped when it actually has not.\r\n\r\nThis issue is resolved by replacing the outputs before doing the size estimation, and also updating the feerate checker to use the actual fee values when calculating the required minimum fee.\r\n\r\nAlso added a test for this scenario.",

Internally, the only change in behavior is that `EraseDestData` deletes rows directly from the database because they are no longer stored in memory. This is more direct and efficient because it uses a single lookup and scan instead of multiple lookups.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this cleanup is making changes like #18550, #18192, #13756 easier to reason about and less likely to result in unintended behavior and bugs\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is a rebased copy of #18608.

          "body": "**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\n`listtransactions \"*\" 100` in a wallet with 35 transactions should list all 35 transactions in the wallet.\r\n\r\n(Update: and given the way `listtransactions` works there will likely be more than one array entry for each transaction, right?)\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\n`listtransactions \"*\" 100` lists 14 transactions, but does not list 21 transactions that are self-sends.\r\n\r\nNote that `getwalletinfo` returns:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"txcount\": 35,\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the wallet does seem to know about the self-send transactions. (The \"missing\" transactions also show up in the GUI)\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nI have only seen the problem with one particular wallet. The only other wallet I have tested with is running on an older Bitcoin Core v0.20.1 (actually Omni Core) version and does seem to correctly list self-sends.\r\n\r\nThe wallet showing the problem is an imported HD `tpub` descriptor wallet that was created with **bitcoinj** and then the descriptors were imported via `importdescriptors`. I noticed that there is a Python functional test for `listtransactions` that checks self-sends, so perhaps the problem is related to it being a watch-only descriptor wallet with imported descriptors. It may also be relevant that the self-sends had two-outputs, both a \"destination\" and a change address.\r\n\r\nI can reliably reproduce the problem with the wallet that is showing the problem.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nMacBook Pro M1\r\nmacOS Monterey 12.5.1\r\n\r\n**Bitcoin Core v23.0.0** pre-built \"official\" binary.\r\n\r\nI am willing to provide additional information and/or run additional tests to help track this down.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "## For reviewers\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to make reviewing a bit more sane, I'm breaking this up into a few smaller PRs, but will keep this one open as the parent PR and keep it rebased on the child PRs. The main purpose of having this PR is to track progress on child PRs and also have an easy way to compile `bitcoind` with both send and receive support for testing. Additionally, I'll be adding more functional tests to this PR since it's much easier to test when `bitcoind` can both send and receive.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122\r\n  - Implements the logic from BIP352 without any wallet code. This PR adds the necessary cryptographic functions and implements the logic needed for sending and scanning. This PR also includes the test vectors from the BIP as unit tests. Both the send and receive PRs have this as a dependency. In terms of priority, this PR should be reviewed first\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201\r\n  - Implements sending in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to send to a silent payment address, regardless of whether or not the wallet can receive silent payments\r\n  - Ready for review, but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28202\r\n  - Implements receiving in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to generate silent payment addresses and scan for silent payments, regardless of whether or not the wallet can send to a silent payment address\r\n  - Ready for review but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n\r\nFor the silent payments specification, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458\r\n\r\n## Overall\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the full silent payments scheme: sending and receiving. The following items are not covered in this PR and are intended for follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n* Adding labels for the receiver wallet\r\n* Full RPC coverage (only `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` are covered in this PR)\r\n* Light client support (vending the tweak data per block, either in an index or to serve to indexer, such as electrum server)\r\n* Add benchmarks to validate that there are no DoS concerns for doing silent payment verification for transactions in the mempool\r\n* External signer support (dependent on hardware wallets supporting silent payments)\r\n* More unit / functional test coverage\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24897. Below is a summary of the major changes:\r\n\r\n* Remove labels\r\n  * The original draft included labels, but this has been deferred for a later PR. Labels are not necessary for sending and receiving and there are still some open questions on how best to implement them in Bitcoin Core. Labels can also be added at any point by the receiver without requiring any changes from the sender\r\n* Remove indexes\r\n  * In the original draft, indexes were used when scanning for silent payments and when doing wallet rescans. This has been removed in favor of using `rev*.dat` files for rescanning. It may make sense to add an index in the future, but for the purpose of vending tweak data to light clients, which is still an open question\r\n* Update to implement the most current version of BIP352\r\n  * Since the original draft, there have been a few changes in the BIP which are reflected in the current PR. Most notably, using 33-byte compressed keys for the silent payment address (as opposed to X-only keys in the original draft) \r\n\r\nIt may be helpful for context to read through the discussions on #24897 , but ongoing review should happen in the relevant child PRs listed above.",

There is no middle-ground.\n\n#### How Change Detection Currently Works?\n\nThe wallet walks-through the transaction outputs, extracts the script\ndestination and verify the following two points:\n\n1) If the destination doesn't exist in the address book, then the script\n    is a \"change address\".\n\n2) If the destination exists in the address book, but it doesn't have a\n     label, then the script is a \"change address\".\n\n### Motivation\n\nThere are a good number of problems in the current approach:\n\n- We make the wallet dependent on an external structure, with separate storage.\n   Which has to be updated and maintained along with the wallet state.\n\n- It cannot be maintained nor recovered across different wallet instances.\n   Cannot re-create the address book data only by importing the wallet descriptor string.\n\n- As the address book is an structure that the user can freely modify, the change\n   detection process might differ through different wallets.\n\n- The current rudimentary assumptions of \"no address book entry\" or \"no label set for the address book entry\"\n  to denote that certain script destination is change or not can easily be broken:\n  E.g. derive an address from one of the wallet’s external paths manually. Then send coins to it.\n  As the receive destination wasn't created inside the wallet, the wallet has no associated address book entry.\n  So, the reception is invalidly detected as change (added a test case for it).\n\n- The wallet can't detect change outputs on more complex scripts such as multi-sig change outputs.\n\n- The wallet is not able to detect any change output going to an internal address if the internal address has a label.\n  (E.g. the user can manually set a label for the internal address and, doing that, make that all the change outputs,\n   in the wallet history, that were sent to the destination are no longer detected as change).\n\n- There isn’t a way to distinguish the external reception of coins into an internal address. Coins reception on any\n   internal address are always detected as change.\n\n### New Change Detection Mechanism Goals\n\nAiming to:\n\n* Define a base mechanism to align different wallet implementations. Preventing each piece of software\n  from diverging on the basic change outputs distinction.\n\n* Detect change outputs on-demand without requiring to maintain an external data structure synced with the\n   latest wallet state.\n\n* Independently, and accurately, detect change outputs regardless data stored in structures that the user\n   can freely modify.\n\n* Granular distinction between change vs non-change outputs that were sent to the same internal address.\n  E.g. the reception of coins, from an external source, on internal addresses will not longer be detected\n  as change anymore.\n\n* Expand the change detection to more complex scripts such as a multi-sig protected addresses. (While they\n  are added into the wallet on an internal spkm)\n\n#### Change Output Detection Rules\n\nA transaction output is change if it fulfills the following points:\n\n1) At least one of the parent transaction inputs is from the wallet. (If none of them are, then the wallet is receiving coins\n    on an internal address).\n\n2) The script extracted destination is from the wallet and is located in one of the internal script pub key manager.\n    (e.g. derived from an internal derivation path)\n\n#### What about legacy wallets?\n\nIf the legacy wallet is HD post-split, we have an internal derivation path, so we can follow the same process as\ndescriptors wallet. Unless the destination is on the pre-split key pool, in which case, we fallback to the follow-up\ncase.\n\nIf the legacy wallet is pre-split, we continue using the address book as we either have an HD wallet with keys\nderived only on the external path, or we are using raw keypool.\n",

          "body": "It is sometimes useful for the wallet to have keys that it can sign with but are not (initially) involved in any scripts, e.g. for setting up a multisig. Ryanofsky [suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1867721948) A `void(KEY)` descriptor which allows for a key to be specified, but produces no scripts. These can be imported into the wallet, and subsequently retrieved with `gethdkeys`. Additionally, `listdescriptors` will output these descriptors so that they can be easily backed up.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it easier for people to add HD keys to their wallet, and to generate a new one if they want to rotate their descriptors, an `addhdkey` RPC is also added. Without arguments, it will generate a new HD key and add it to the wallet via a `void(KEY)` descriptor. If provided a private key, it will construct the descriptor and add it to the wallet.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1866961865\r\n\r\nBased on #29130 as `gethdkeys` is useful for testing this.",

          "title": "wallet: Add `createwalletdescriptor` and `gethdkeys` RPCs for adding new automatically generated descriptors",
          "body": "This PR adds a `createwalletdescriptor` RPC which allows users to add new automatically generated descriptors to their wallet, e.g. to upgrade a 0.21.x wallet to contain a taproot descriptor. This RPC takes 3 arguments: the output type to create a descriptor for, whether the descriptor will be internal or external, and the HD key to use if the user wishes to use a specific key. The HD key is an optional parameter. If it is not specified, the wallet will use the key shared by the active descriptors, if they are all single key. For most users in the expected upgrade scenario, this should be sufficient. In more advanced cases, the user must specify the HD key to use.\r\n\r\nCurrently, specified HD keys must already exist in the wallet. To make it easier for the user to know, `gethdkeys` is also added to list out the HD keys in use by all of the descriptors in the wallet. This will include all HD keys, whether we have the private key, for it, which descriptors use it and their activeness, and optionally the extended private key. In this way, users with more complex wallets will be still be able to get HD keys from their wallet for use in other scenarios, and if they want to use `createwalletdescriptor`, they can easily get the keys that they can specify to it.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1866961865",
