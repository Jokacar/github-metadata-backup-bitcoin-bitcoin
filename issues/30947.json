E.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75296149/cmake-set-project-to-c-20#comment132865328_75296149\r\n\r\nThat sounds potentially more tedious than just waiting for compile to fail.\r\n\r\n> There is no need to use brew to install clang/llvm. You can just pick the newer XCode: `sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode_15.0.app`\r\n\r\nThat only works if you install Xcode, otherwise you're stuck on whichever version of the command-line tools came with the OS.\r\n\r\nYou can't install Xcode via the App Store (on macOS 13). You have to download it via the Developer Center. Account required (the free one). You'll need version 15.2, because 15.4 required macOS 14.\r\n\r\nSo that's more tedious than using Homebrew, but arguably it's a cleaner approach.\r\n\r\n",
