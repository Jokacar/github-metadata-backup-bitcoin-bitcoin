Make the determinism clear through removing the no longer useful `g_insecure_rand_ctx_temp_path`.\r\n\r\nFixes #30696.",

In that case I can drop that commit.\r\n\r\nYes, adding code like `fuzz_env['RANDOM_CTX_SEED'] = random_seed` to the fuzz runner also seems to go in the wrong direction a bit. The goal of the fuzz tests is to be fully deterministic and stable, within a single run and across different runs. If the fuzz randomness is seeded with anything other than stuff provided by the fuzz engine, it is easy to get non-determinism, or coverage instability.

      "body": "Thank you for your detailed linked comment @maflcko. Apologies for not going back to re-read it before publishing this PR.\r\n\r\nBefore publishing, I did recall that you were worried about fuzz tests and ran:\r\n```\r\nRANDOM_CTX_SEED=21 ./test/fuzz/test_runner.py -j40 .\r\n```\r\n..with this added temporarily:\r\n```C++\r\nprintf(\"%s\\n\", rand_str.c_str());\r\n```\r\nThe hashes outputted were unique. I admit it surprised me and I also printed `test_path` and saw they were empty. Should have dug deeper at that point to figure out the cause of randomness before publishing the PR.\r\n\r\nAfter your latest comment I dug deeper, discovering:\r\n* **test/fuzz/test_runner.py** does not automatically forward on environment variables, I guess it wants to keep the environment under tighter control. Making it explicitly forward `RANDOM_CTX_SEED` makes the deterministic randomness of the fuzz tests start from the same seed.\r\n\r\nOutputting `getpid()` in the `BasicTestingSetup`-ctor now shows unique PIDs per fuzz test. I hesitate to add the PID to the seed since the intent of 97e16f57042cab07e5e73f6bed19feec2006e4f7 seems to be to decrease determinism). In the case of benchmarks, the PID would probably not help either, as the intent seems to be to run them single-threaded(?) - which would at the same time mean directories being created/destroyed should not be an issue for benchmarks.\r\n\r\nI've opted in the latest push to implement forwarding of `RANDOM_CTX_SEED` and implemented `G_TEST_GET_FULL_NAME` for bench+fuzz. Please let me know what you think about that approach.\r\n\r\n(Noticed in the debugger that the `BasicTestingSetup`-ctor, after creating the test directories, creates the `kernel::Context` which calls `RandomInit()` which calls `ProcRand(..., /*always_use_real_rng=*/true)` ...which should be harmless as long as `RNGState::m_deterministic_prng` has been set).",

Increased determinism appears to be the original intent behind moving `SeedRandomForTest` earlier in 97e16f57042cab07e5e73f6bed19feec2006e4f7, please let me know if you have a different interpretation. All your suggestions lead to decreased determinism, to avoid repetition, I only left additional comments:\r\n\r\n1. \"Use `GetStrongRandBytes`, however, I am not sure how slow that'd be in the worst case.\" - You pointed out that it may be a bit slow.\r\n\r\n2. \"Move the `SeedRandomForTest` after the fuzz target's `init` function, but before `ResetCoverageCounters`. However that'd still break if the fuzz target spun up a TestingSetup.\" - As `init` often creates `BasicTestingSetup`, that approach would also need to have the **setup_common.cpp** part of 97e16f57042cab07e5e73f6bed19feec2006e4f7 reverted. As you said any later created `BasicTestingSetup` after `init` would become deterministic.\r\n\r\n3. \"Use the hash of the current folder generator, as well as the hash of the pid. Which may obviously break once the kernel wraps the pids, but I am not sure how likely that is.\" - Addressed in my [previous comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30737#discussion_r1735853776).\r\n\r\n4. Ensure the `g_rng_temp_path` is seeded before any call to `SeedRandomForTest`. - Just the general determinism concern above.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>  Also, obviously, the issue would remain if the same test is run in parallel\r\n\r\nThe same test being run in parallel *with itself* could use `-testdatadir`. Is that a common case?\r\n\r\nEdit: Could use different `RANDOM_CTX_SEED` if wanting to run the same test in parallel with itself as well.",

(\"Random context to get unique temp data dirs.\")\r\n\r\nAha, time to bring out the `git log -S \"Random context to get unique temp data dirs\"` command. ;)\r\n\r\nI see it was your fae43a97ca947cd0802392e9bb86d9d0572c0fba from 2019, so it's hard to argue that the author may have meant \"unique\" as in simply different from other tests. :) See you introduced the later seeding of the RNG in that commit too.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you (together with me) ACKed #29625 which contains 97e16f57042cab07e5e73f6bed19feec2006e4f7, moving the seeding prior to directory naming randomization. Do you now disagree with it?\r\n\r\n> Once you make it deterministic, there will be a chance of collision, which may lead to a crash, which this pull request is trying to fix, no?\r\n\r\nThe PR *does fix* collisions between *different* tests that would otherwise happen when `RANDOM_CTX_SEED` was set to the same value, which was resulting in the same folder name being used. (`RANDOM_CTX_SEED=21 make -j10 check`).\r\n\r\n> I don't think anything here is a common case. So in theory an alternative \"fix\" would be to simply say in a comment that RANDOM_CTX_SEED can only be used when running a single test process at a time.\r\n\r\nCombining tests with setting `RANDOM_CTX_SEED` is indeed an edge case. This PR arguably implements missing test names for bench+fuzz, missing support for forwarding `RANDOM_CTX_SEED` to fuzz tests, simplifies the code through removing `g_rng_temp_path` which had a no longer valid comment after 97e16f57042cab07e5e73f6bed19feec2006e4f7, the main fix/complexity lies in adding entropy to the random folder path using the test name.\r\n\r\nThe extremely paranoid would say that the folder name generation could influence test success/failure, so having it deterministic is helpful. Unit tests are poorly written if that is ever the case, but for fuzzing it's still an open question to me.",

Has there ever been a known issue due to a fixed-size ascii-hex-encoded path element? Stuff like variable-size or non-hex-ascii are known to possibly find issues, but a fixed size [a-f0-9] element, I am not aware of.\r\n\r\nMoreover, adding code like `fuzz_env['RANDOM_CTX_SEED'] = random_seed` to the fuzz runner also seems to go in the wrong direction a bit. The goal of the fuzz tests is to be fully deterministic and stable, within a single run and across different runs. If the fuzz randomness is seeded with anything other than stuff provided by the fuzz engine, it is easy to get non-determinism, or coverage instability.\r\n\r\nAn having different types of \"seed\" in the fuzz context is also confusing.\r\n\r\n> If they don't want to set different `RANDOM_CTX_SEED` they can set different `-testdatadir` (and probably should, for clarity in case there are failures).\r\n\r\nWell, the only point of setting `RANDOM_CTX_SEED` is to reproduce a past failure. However, if you want to go down the route of requiring to set a different testdatadir when wanting to run the same test in parallel, it may be best to fully go that route. Instead of a hash, just use the test name as-is? This would also be parallel to the functional tests.",
