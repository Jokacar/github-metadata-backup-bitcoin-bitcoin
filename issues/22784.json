    "title": "combinerawtransaction fails to properly combine transactions containing taproot inputs",
    "body": "If `combinerawtransaction` is given a transaction containing completed taproot spends, it will drop the signatures from those inputs. For 0.21, `combinerawtransaction` would actually cause an assertion failure - this was fixed by #21330. This is not a regression as `combinerawtransaction` never worked with txs with taproot inputs anyways. AFAICT, either taproot was not yet implemented, it hit an assertion, or it is broken.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I don't think this is particularly important to fix since the recommended workflow is to use PSBTs. But I am opening this issue to document this in case someone does come across this bug.\r\n\r\nOriginally found by @roconnor-blockstream ",

          "body": "`BaseSignatureChecker` has virtual functions which are overridden by its child classes. These virtual functions have a default implementation. However because of the default implementation, bugs can be introduced by failing to implement one of them (e.g. #21151). To avoid this, those functions are made into pure virtual functions so that child classes must implement those functions. There are a few places where a `BaseSignatureChecker` was being created; these instances have been replaced with the `DUMMY_CHECKER`.\r\n\r\n`GenericTransactionSignatureChecker` has two constructors, one which takes a `PrecomputedTransactionData` and one which does not. It can be difficult to understand which one to use, and whether a particular `GenericTransactionSignatureChecker` has a `PrecomputedTransactionData`. This has lead to some bugs as well (e.g. #22784). Looking through the codebase, the only place where `PrecomputedTransactionData` does not need to be provided is in the unit tests. As such, this PR changes `GenericTransactionSignatureChecker` to have only one constructor which requires `PrecomputedTransactionData` to be provided. This has a side effect of requiring the same for `MutableTransactionSignatureCreator`, which also had two constructors, and the one that did not require `PrecomputedTransactionData` was only used in tests.",
