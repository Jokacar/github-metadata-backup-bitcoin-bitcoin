    "body": "While regtesting with [bitcoin-spock](https://github.com/msgilligan/bitcoin-spock) I noticed at some point the transaction creation via `sendtoaddress -> CreateTransaction()` fails, because the created transaction is larger than `MAX_STANDARD_TX_SIZE`.\n\nDuring the process a lot of raw transactions are created, which have smallish outputs and when then using `sendtoaddress`, it appears to attempt to create a transaction that spends too many of those dust-ish outputs.\n\nThe transaction to create does not have many outputs, but it looks like it's caused by the coin selection, which selects too many inputs. Testing was done with a 0.9 branch, but on the first glimpse I believe this issue is as well be present in 0.10. If this is a known issue, and if there is already a guard against this behavior, I'd be happy about a hint.\n\nSorry in advance, I do not have a test script to reproduce this issue in an isolated manner. A potential fix would probably require to adjust the coin selection, so that it selects a combination of coins, which, in addition to the size of the rest of the transaction, is still smaller than the limit.\n",

      "body": "Thanks for the link! Unfortunally it doesn't seem to be related, but this issue is certainly something that probably won't appear outside of a testing environment. I created a test for it nevertheless:\n\nhttps://github.com/dexX7/bitcoin/blob/qa-coin-selection-limit/qa/rpc-tests/coinselection_size_limit.py\n\nThe problem is that the coin selection doesn't relate to the transaction size at all. I came up with three scenarios, all failing at the moment:\n\nScenario 1:\n- The actor starts with 1x 50.0 BTC and 1000x 0.05 BTC (100.0 BTC total) unspent outputs\n- Then tries to spend 49.5 BTC\n- The 50.0 BTC output should be selected, because the transaction would otherwise be too large\n\nScenario 2:\n- The actor starts with 500x 0.1 BTC and 1000x 0.05 BTC (100.0 BTC total) unspent outputs\n- Then tries to spend 49.5 BTC\n- A combination of coins should be selected, such that the created transaction is not too large\n\nScenario 3 (available as RPC test):\n- The actor starts with 1x 50.0 BTC, 500x 0.1 BTC and 1000x 0.05 BTC (150.0 BTC total) unspent outputs\n- Then tries to spend 49.5 BTC\n- A combination of coins should be selected, such that the created transaction is not too large\n\nFor each scenario at least one solution exists, where a combination of coins results in a transaction that has a size of less than `MAX_STANDARD_TX_SIZE`.\n",

Bitcoin v.0.11.0\n\nTo re-create this issue \n\n1)  create a new empty wallet\n2)  send 700 (yes 700) transactions to a single address in your new wallet from step 1.  In my test\nI sent 1500 satoshi's for each of the 700.\n3) From your new wallet send out a 2000 satoshi transaction and clck send (you will get the proper send confirmation dialog)\n4) Close the dialog and send another 50 transactions into your wallet. Now you should have 750 outputs in your wallet all under one single address.\n5) Now try to send the same 2000 satoshi transaction:  you will receive a \"Transaction too large\"  dialog.  Click OK on this and you will now receive the \"Transaction creation failed!\"  dialog.\n\nNote: if you use the coin control feature you can select a couple of the outputs and then send correctly it`s only when coin control is not used that this issue happens.\n",

      "body": "From a quick glance, it looks to me that we still not check for the maximum weight during coin selection. So, while the much lighter modern input types make it even less likely that the max weight would be hit and at high feerates we deliberately aim for a small input weight, I don't think that we currently explicitly prevent that outcome during coin selection when it's in the consolidatory feerate range.\r\n\r\nIt would probably be a good first issue to check whether a selection result will be smaller than the maximum weight and to discard a selection result if not. Hopefully the other selection result candidates or a later back-off iteration would find a solution that fits then, but a slightly more involved task could be to add logic that guides coin selection to avoid exceeding the maximum weight if possible.",
