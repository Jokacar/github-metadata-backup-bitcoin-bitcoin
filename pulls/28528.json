This is due to the implementation currently enforcing a direct single-byte data push (using `CScriptOp.encode_op_n`), which obviously fails for values 17+. Fix that by passing the numbers directly to the CScript list, where it's automatically converted to minimally-encoded pushes (see class method `CScript.__coerce_instance`, branch `isinstance(other, int)`). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second commit adds a unit test to ensure that the encoding  is correct.",

          "body": "Fixing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28250#issuecomment-1674830104 and more.\r\n\r\nCurrently, redeem scripts longer than 520 bytes, which are technically valid under segwit rules, have flaws in the following processes:\r\n1) The multisig creation process fails to deduce the output descriptor, resulting in the generation of an incorrect descriptor. Additionally, the accompanying user warning is also inaccurate.\r\n2) The `signrawtransactionwithkey` RPC command fail to sign them.\r\n3) The legacy wallet `addmultisigaddress` wrongly discards them.\r\n\r\nThe issue arises because most of these flows are utilizing the legacy spkm keystore, which imposes\r\nthe [p2sh max redeem script size rule](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ded687334031f4790ef6a36b999fb30a79dcf7b3/src/script/signingprovider.cpp#L160) on all scripts. Which blocks segwit redeem scripts longer than\r\nthe max element size in all the previously mentioned processes (`createmultisig`, `addmultisigaddress`, and\r\n`signrawtransactionwithkey`).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem, enabling the creation of multisig output descriptors involving more than 15 keys and\r\nallowing the signing of these scripts, along with other post-segwit redeem scripts that surpass the 520-byte\r\np2sh limit.\r\n\r\nImportant note:\r\nInstead of adding support for these longer redeem scripts in the legacy wallet, an \"unsupported operation\"\r\nerror has been added. The reasons behind this decision are:\r\n\r\n1) The introduction of this feature brings about a compatibility-breaking change that requires downgrade\r\n    protection; older wallets would be unable to interact with these \"new\" legacy wallets.\r\n\r\n2) Considering the ongoing deprecation of the legacy spkm, this issue provides another compelling\r\n    reason to transition towards descriptors.\r\n\r\nTesting notes:\r\nTo easily verify each of the fixes, I decoupled the tests into standalone commits. So they can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master. Where `rpc_createmultisig.py` (with and without the `--legacy-wallet`\r\narg) will fail without the bugs fixes commits.\r\n\r\nExtra note:\r\nThe initial commits improves the `rpc_createmultisig.py` test in many ways. I found this test very\r\nantiquated, screaming for an update and cleanup.",

          "body": "In wallet-related functional tests we often want to send funds to an address and  use the resulting (non-change) UTXO directly after as input for another transaction. Doing that is currently tedious, as it involves finding the index part of the outpoint manually by calling helpers like `find_vout_for_address` or `find_output` first.  This results in two different txid/vout variables which then again have to be combined to a single dictionary `{\"txid\": ..., \"vout\": ...}` in order to be specified as input for RPCs like `createrawtransaction` or `createpsbt`. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntxid1 = node1.sendtoaddress(addr1, value1)\r\nvout1 = find_vout_for_address(node1, txid1, addr1)\r\ntxid2 = node2.sendtoaddress(addr2, value2)\r\nvout2 = find_vout_for_address(node2, txid2, addr2)\r\nnode.createrawtransaction([{'txid': txid1, 'vout': vout1}, {'txid': txid2, 'vout': vout2}], .....)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a helper `create_outpoints` to immediately return the outpoint as\r\nUTXO dictionary in the common format, making the tests more readable and avoiding unnecessary duplication:\r\n\r\n```\r\nutxo1 = self.create_outpoints(node1, outputs=[{addr1: value1}])[0]\r\nutxo2 = self.create_outpoints(node2, outputs=[{addr2: value2}])[0]\r\nnode.createrawtransaction([utxo1, utxo2], .....)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTests are switched to work with UTXO-objects rather than two individual txid/vout variables accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe `find_output` helper is removed, as it seems generally a bad idea to search for an outpoint only based on the output value. If that's really ever needed in the future, it makes probably more sense to add it as an additional parameter to `find_vout_of_address`. Note that `find_output` supported specifying a block-hash for where to look for the transaction (being passed on to the `getrawtransaction` RPC). This seems to be unneeded, as txids are always unique and for the only test that used that parameter (rpc_psbt.py) there was no observed difference in run-time, so it was not reintroduced in the new helper.\r\n\r\nThere are still some `find_vout_of_address` calls remaining, used for detecting change outputs or for whenever the sending happens via `sendrawtransaction` instead, so this PR tackles not all, but the most common case.",

          "body": "It was somewhat surprising to me that wallet_backwards_compatibility.py did not catch #27915 since the purpose of the test is to find downgrade issues such as that. It turns out the test was deficient in several places when it came to testing descriptor wallets, as well as deficient in addition to failing to correctly test some releases.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these test cases, adds more informative logging, slightly refactors the entire test in order to better test future versions, and adds a 25.0 node to the test.\r\n\r\nNotable changes:\r\n* The compatibility test with 0.16 should not have been passing. The wallets were being copied incorrectly for 0.16 and resulting in 0.16 creating new wallets rather than testing the target wallets.\r\n* The downgrade test will actually be run on descriptor wallets and it will test that downgrades are successful, and a subsequent upgrade is also successful. This catches #27915.\r\n* The upgrade and downgrade test will be run on all versions up to master, rather than just 0.16, 0.17, and 0.19.",

          "title": "MiniTapscript: port Miniscript to Tapscript",
          "body": "Miniscript was targeting P2WSH, and as such can currently only be used in `wsh()` descriptors. This pull request introduces support for Tapscript in Miniscript and makes Miniscript available inside `tr()` descriptors. It adds support for both watching *and* signing TapMiniscript descriptors.\r\n\r\nThe main changes to Miniscript for Tapscript are the following:\r\n- A new `multi_a` fragment is introduced with the same semantics as `multi`. Like in other descriptors `multi` and `multi_a` can exclusively be used in respectively P2WSH and Tapscript.\r\n- The `d:` fragment has the `u` property under Tapscript, since the `MINIMALIF` rule is now consensus. See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24906.\r\n- Keys are now serialized as 32 bytes. (Note this affects the key hashes.)\r\n- The resource consumption checks and calculation changed. Some limits were lifted in Tapscript, and signatures are now 64 bytes long.\r\n\r\nThe largest amount of complexity probably lies in the last item. Scripts under Taproot can now run into the maximum stack size while executing a fragment. For instance if you've got a stack size of `999` due to the initial witness plus some execution that happened before and try to execute a `hash256` it would `DUP` (increasing the stack size `1000`), `HASH160` and then push the hash on the stack making the script fail.\r\nTo make sure this does not happen on any of the spending paths of a sane Miniscript, we introduce a tracking of the maximum stack size during execution of a fragment. See the commits messages for details. Those commits were separated from the resource consumption change, and the fuzz target was tweaked to sometimes pad the witness so the script runs on the brink of the stack size limit to make sure the stack size was not underestimated.\r\n\r\nExisting Miniscript unit, functional and fuzz tests are extended with Tapscript logic and test cases. Care was taken for seed stability in the fuzz targets where we cared more about them.\r\n\r\nThe design of Miniscript for Tapscript is the result of discussions between various people over the past year(s). To the extent of my knowledge at least Pieter Wuille, Sanket Kanjalkar, Andrew Poelstra and Andrew Chow contributed thoughts and ideas.",
