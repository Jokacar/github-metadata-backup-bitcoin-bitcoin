    "title": "Prune Node Rescan Project Tracking",
    "body": "This issue will be edited frequently to reflect the current status of the project.\r\n\r\n#### What should I review now? \r\n\r\n👇 👇 👇 👇 👇 👇\r\n#28170  and #28955\r\n☝️ ☝️ ☝️ ☝️ ☝️ ☝️ \r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to enable complete blockchain rescan capability on prune nodes, allowing these storage-limited nodes to import new wallet descriptors and update existing ones at any time, as well as loading external wallets with a birth-time older than 48 hours. This, in turn, enables the monitoring of new addresses/scripts and tracking balance changes without the need to repeatedly download the entire blockchain.\r\n\r\nThe first project milestone introduces the feature for prune nodes that construct and maintain a local block filters set database. The node will request and keep track of the missing historical blocks that match the wallet scripts filters set to subsequently perform the rescan.\r\n\r\n#### The following sections are ordered by their PRs dependencies:\r\n\r\n##### Net: Single Block Requests Tracking System and On Download Failure Retry Mechanism\r\n* [ ] #28170\r\n* [ ] #28120\r\n* [ ] #27837\r\n\r\n##### Indexes Stability and Performance Improvements\r\n* [X] #27607\r\n* [X] #27720\r\n* [ ] #28955\r\n* [ ] #26966\r\n\r\n##### Wallet Rescan (depends on the net section)\r\n* [X] #27469\r\n* [ ] Cache wallet filters' set and connect it to the current wallet rescan functionality.
