    "body": "Note: This is just a proof of concept put here for discussion/feedback/brainstorming/improvement. I am not sure if we want to merge this into core at all since it can be dealt with externally as well. But this was the simplest way for me to make it work and it's probably also simpler for many miners to run this branch rather than another external software.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nTestnet4 fixes block storms but it kept the minimum-difficulty exception in place. The rationale was that this would be the only way developers could still get their non-standard transactions into the blockchain. However, probably due to the public discussion of this feature, this has attracted the attention of people whose motivation might be A) grab as many testnet coins as possible or B) to annoy developers. There are currently one or more actors who just max out the min-difficulty exception as much as possible and as quickly as possible, see https://mempool.space/testnet4. There are always several min-difficulty blocks appearing instantly after a normal difficulty mined block.\r\n\r\nThere are several implications to this:\r\n- Developers can not get their non-standard transactions into the blockchain using the min-exception blocks, unless they put in significant effort to outrace the spammers\r\n- The actual difficulty is artificially raised\r\n- Less coins are going to faucets (though this is a very minor issue)\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution to this problem was already briefly discussed in the original pull request for Testnet4: The min-difficulty blocks can all be easily re-orged by a single block with the actual difficulty. The code here implements this functionality within the `getblocktemplate` RPC. All blocks with min-difficulty (including forks) are temporarily marked invalid while the template is created. The blocks are only temporarily marked invalid since another miner might find an actual difficulty block on top of the min-difficulty blocks and we don't want to create a fork in the chain in that case.\r\n\r\nWe do want to keep the transactions from the blocks and include them in the block template. That should work with this solution via the orphan pool but I haven't done extensive testing on this yet. In reality it seems like there are several transactions in these min-difficulty blocks with a minimum block height and these can not be included in the re-org block (except the ones that are in the first one). However, given that these transactions appear in almost every block it might just be self-transfers created by the spammer.\r\n\r\n### Mining Pool\r\n\r\nThe follow-up to this would be to run a public (solo) pool with this enabled so that we can get some more hash rate behind this without requiring any effort on the side of those with hash rate and demotivate the spammers.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nI worked on this at Bitcoin++ in Berlin a week ago together with Emzy and Sjors. Together we were able to demo a pool running a previous version of this PR and connected a miner to it. That pool isn't public yet though.\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\nHere are some log outputs showing how first the orphan blocks are invalidated and then the actual chain is rolled back. Then, after the template was constructed, the blocks are reconsidered.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Logs</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-10-19T13:14:29Z InvalidChainFound: invalid

      "body": "> The rationale was that this would be the only way developers could still get their non-standard transactions into the blockchain.\r\n\r\nWell, the solution to that is quite simple: if non-standard transactions would be normally propagated, then developers could simply publish them, and have them confirmed. Unless you want to get an additional spam protection, by requiring every developer to provide 32 leading zero bits in Proof of Work. But in that case, just doing OP_SIZE on a signature will give you the same outcome.\r\n\r\n> grab as many testnet coins as possible\r\n\r\nNote that testnet4 is already traded at 20 satoshis per 1 tBTC4. And testnet5 will also be, if it will be released in a similar way: https://altquick.com/exchange/market/BitcoinTestnet4\r\n\r\n> There are always several min-difficulty blocks appearing instantly after a normal difficulty mined block.\r\n\r\nWhen coins get non-zero value, then people are simply trying to get the maximum number of blocks, and sell them. And the original algorithm from Bitcoin Core is far from optimal. If you pick future timestamps, then you can for example instantly mine as many CPU blocks as possible, and then put some ASIC block on top of that. Which means, that staying 2 hours in the future is profitable. And also: mining ASIC blocks 2 hours in the future is also profitable, because then, you block potential CPU-mined blocks from being broadcasted, for the next 20 minutes (meanwhile, you prepare such block, and then release it, when the network time will get there).\r\n\r\n> The actual difficulty is artificially raised\r\n\r\nIt is always the case, if you count CPU-mined blocks into difficulty adjustments. Because if you have 2016 blocks, where 1008 blocks are CPU-mined, and 1008 blocks are ASIC-mined, then in practice, the real difficulty should be calculated after the next 1008 ASIC blocks. But instead, it is re-adjusted now, so the more CPU-mined blocks are there, the less ASIC-mined blocks remains (until falling above 10 minutes per block on average, when the difficulty then starts falling).\r\n\r\n> The min-difficulty blocks can all be easily re-orged by a single block with the actual difficulty.\r\n\r\nIf it will be harder to mine testnet4, then the value per coin will increase. Which means more trading. Unless people will stay in testnet3, where the chain is faster, because of blockstorms.\r\n\r\n> We do want to keep the transactions from the blocks and include them in the block template.\r\n\r\nAll of them? Including also those with zero fees, or other non-matching mempool policy?",

Which means, that it is time for testnet5. But: it should have different rules, because if blocks would have any persistence, then they will be traded again. That's why all of them should be stale, so they could be shared between interested parties, while also being worthless at the same time.",
