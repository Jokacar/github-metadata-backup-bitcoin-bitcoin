          "body": "What is this PR, this pr allows for an upgrade path for non-HD wallets to HD.\r\n\r\nSome of the work for this PR was done in bitcoins PR and the other half @mrmetech or me. This implementation supports the upgrade of both non-encrypted and encrypted wallets were bitcoin only supports none encrypted wallets.\r\n\r\n**WHY**\r\nThe reason why you would want this is that is makes upgrading to a HD wallet a lot easier than before where you would have to spend a good bit of time, but more importantly, know what you're doing. This PR is meant to make upgrading to HD wallets a lot easier for the average user, so I have added a GUI for it and RPC command. having An HD wallet also makes keeping your coins safe from random things that could occur like your wallet is corrupted you could recover your coins by just restoring you wallet from the words. _You would have to have moved your coins from an old address to a new one generated from your HD words first._\r\n\r\n**IMAGES OF THE CHANGES**\r\n\r\nAs you see in this image a new button is here called upgrade non-HD wallet to HD. Once you click this it will ask you for your password your wallet is encrypted, after that it will bring up the new mnemonic setup code I wrote from another PR, you can restore from your previous words or make new words if you never had a HD wallet before.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31669092/75505196-cf3c7100-5997-11ea-8f10-ed743f31188b.png)\r\n\r\nI also added a new RPC command called upgrade to HD, You will need to enter your mnemonic words in a stringe and your password for examle you would enter something like this into the command line\r\n`upgradetohd \"cat dog cricket computer laptop mushroom answer candy boat pond example coil train ticket ticket green bird elegant bird jazz play dog real morning\" true \"my password\"`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31669092/75505355-2a6e6380-5998-11ea-9568-e03e80192792.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Q&A:**\r\n**Q:** Didn't bitcoin already implement this in Bitcoin 17\r\n**A:** Yes and no they did implement a way to upgrade a non-HD wallet to a HD wallet, the issue with it, is the way it was implemented only supports upgrading non-encrypted wallets, which is a major issue for people who want to upgrade to HD saying that the first thing most people did was encrypt there wallet. Although in the original PR there was no mention that it didn't support encrypted wallets there were at least three issues on the bitcoin repo which had talked about this and reported this issue. \r\n\r\nThe reason users couldn't upgrade if their wallet was encrypted was that in order to upgrade you would have to generate the new keys, which new keys can not be added if the wallet is locked. It is more complicated than that, but that is a more simple and first issue you would run into.",
