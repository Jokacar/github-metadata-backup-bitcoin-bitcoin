A few design decisions that I went with but happy to change: \r\n\r\n1. Very basic multi arg support\r\n    a. Can have 0 args and continue to feed via file input like before\r\n    b. Can have 1 or more args that is a file or directory\r\n    d. Subdirectories are ignored if you pass in a directory (though you can use `dir/*` to include files from subdirectories)\r\n2. Based the file reading off of [util/readwritefile.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/util/readwritefile.cpp#L13) with small changes to make it a buffer instead of a string (could reuse that but turn string to buffer?)\r\n3.
