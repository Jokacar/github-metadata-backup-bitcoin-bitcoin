    "body": "The Windows 32 bit build was recently removed:\r\n* #15939: `gitian: Remove Windows 32 bit build`\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with the following supported 32 bit platforms:\r\n\r\n* `arm-linux-gnueabihf` (compiled in Travis)\r\n* `i686-pc-linux-gnu` (compiled and tested in Travis)\r\n\r\nAs the number of developers testing on these platforms decrease the probability of errors due to incorrect assumptions about `sizeof(size_t)`, `sizeof(time_t)` and `sizeof(long)` is likely to increase.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we risk incorrectly assuming that reported errors on said platforms are 32 bit only bugs: the recent GCC miscompilation issue would likely have been identified much faster if it wasn't thought to be \"merely\" an `i686-pc-linux-gnu` issue for the first six months after being reported (see history in #14580: `32-bit test failure: test/crypto_tests.cpp`).\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n1. What can be done to improve testing under these platforms until we drop support?\r\n2. In which order do we envision dropping support for the mentioned platforms?",

Stress situations are more likely to occur as well (maybe that is a negative in some ways, but a positive in others).\r\n\r\nIt strikes me as relatively easy to test on `i686-pc-linux-gnu` if you're doing 64-bit as well; you can at least use the same hardware (not sure if there is the same level of backwards-compatibility for all ARM platforms).",

Is anyone running x86-32 VMs for other purposes than testing software on that architecture? Even with that, how much testing are these binaries getting?\r\n\r\n(to be clear, I'm not arguing to *remove support for 32-bit*, just to stop building and providing binaries for it.
