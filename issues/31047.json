    "body": "Porting this issue from: https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/issues/341.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear if using our Coverage build type works with Clang, or not. In the linked thread there are simultaneous claims that it \"works\", but also that it does not work. It seems from the discussion that even using GCC with the Coverage build type is flaky.\r\n\r\nThere's been suggestions to add a Coverage mode for Clang: https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/233, however adding a second way of doing things, when the current way may not work properly, and (likely?) currently isn't being used by anyone, doesn't seem like a good approach, and adds even more complication to the build system. Note that devs are already using Clang for coverage regardless of if it currently exists in the build system (cc @dergoegge, @marcofleon, @vasild).\r\n\r\nIf using Clangs native coverage mode is what is preferred/is \"better\", then it'd seem better for us to replace the current, more GCC focussed implementation, with one that is geared towards LLVM/Clang, if the idea is to provide something that works out-of-the-box, and is generally used by the developers working on the project.",

Usually there was problem with path prefixes or a `lcov` version mismatch. The coverage reports themselves were always hard to read and I could not find any documentation on how to read them, for example:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-10-07 12-18-00](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16e4469b-542c-44be-b305-d26f6a6d2092)\r\n\r\nHow is branch coverage supposed to be interpreted from this?\r\n\r\nI've switched all my coverage reports to using LLVM's native coverage tooling: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html#id3. I don't use our build in command to produce coverage reports but I think it's a useful thing to have, so devs can easily produce their own coverage reports. I can recommend switching to LLVM's native coverage reporting, as that has been far less of a struggle in my experience.",

However our build system doesn't need to (and shouldn't have to) handle all possible combinations of compiler + tooling. Providing a single convenience build type that is the same as what is used by the majority of the developers seems fine, however I don't think we need to natively support anything outside of that, given it's unlikely to be tested/used, or work properly, and just futher complicates our build system.
