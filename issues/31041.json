(also wow; I did not notice in the readme this requires > 1.3TB of disk space to sync)\r\n\r\nMemory usage as I measured peaked at about 1.9GB for `bitcoind`, compared with 6.1GB for `electrs`. This machine has 64GB RAM so total utilization was low. `electrs` did crash and require me to increase the max file descriptor count (with `ulimit -n`) which I wasn't expecting, but after that everything worked smoothly.\r\n\r\nMy `bitcoind` was already running (and synced) with default mempool size when I began the `electrs` sync. Perhaps this is the key difference from your methodology @dr-orlovsky ? Otherwise, I am not sure why mine behaved so differently...\r\n\r\nI could try with systemd's `MemoryMax=bytes` or a docker container, to force-limit maximum memory of `bitcoind`, perhaps?",
