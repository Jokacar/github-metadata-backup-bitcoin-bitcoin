    "body": "I understand that it is not a new issue but I could not find any answer to my problem in previous threads. \r\nI am syncing the bitcoin core for the first time , it has already past 48 hours and the progress is at 80%.\r\n\r\nThe issue that I am trying to figure out is that why it is not using the full resources of my computer. \r\nMy computer is about 6 years old. \r\nI have a 5G internet and I tested my download speed which is about 50 mbps . I have increased the dbcache to 8000, threads to -1 and I have disabled windows antivirus. No other program is running but still my connectivity to peers are very slow. \r\nI can see that my CPU usage is at about 2% to 10% . memory usage is also very low. so I dont know what else to do to speed it it up. \r\nsome times it speeds up but again it slows down.  Please let me know if you have any suggestion",

I have therefore pushed this to my own fork so that you can see the new templates, along with how the output is rendered in newly-created issues:\r\n\r\n[github.com/willcl-ark/bitcoin/issues](https://github.com/willcl-ark/bitcoin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)\r\n\r\nI did make some minor changes to some of the template wording, but this change could also be a good time to add/remove additional questions.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a net-positive for me, setting aside the issue that if we ever migrated away from GitHub these might have to be ported back to *.md (or something else), but that seems easy-enough that this change would be worth it.\r\n\r\nCurious to know what others think of this, and whether they would suggest adding any other questions to any of the templates as part of this update?",
