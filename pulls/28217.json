Bare multisig peaked in April, barely crossing 10k unspent outputs a day, and currently adds only a few hundred daily, while BRC-20 still keeps adding over 50k unspent outputs every day.\r\n\r\nI know it, unfortunately no mempool option for inscriptions is available at the moment, so even if Baremultisig is less used it remains spam for my node.",

(ie the reduction in counterparty spam after the OP-RETURN limit was added (ironic that this limit is being considered for removal as we speak here #28130...it's almost as if these issues are related!)\r\n\r\nThe question is, does Core have a current mandate to make this policy change, and the political will do deal with the blowback?\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I believe they not only have the mandate, but the responsibility. \r\n\r\nBut do they have the will to deal with the drama of this?\r\n\r\nFrom what I have seen, not so much (and I totally get why!). \r\n\r\nConcept ACK",

Bloating the blocks with huge data streams is bad enough for full nodes, but bloating the UTXO set is worse and in the last 4 moths it has grown at an unprecedented 40%[^1] due to a tidal wave of BRC-20 transactions that pay more fees than sats they move just to inscribe small json payloads that are well below 10k bytes[^2].\r\n\r\nFortunately detecting these transactions does not involve decoding the script and looking for ASCII strings or some other patterns of data. It's as simple as detecting the `OP_0` `OP_IF` data envelope in the script, and an unofficial patch that does that has been circulating informally since early February[^3]. I see no reason why a more refined version of this patch (with proper unit tests etc) should not make its way into Bitcoin Core eventually, as it's the same kind of issue (and mitigation) we're dealing in here.\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://statoshi.info/d/000000009/unspent-transaction-output-set?orgId=1&refresh=5s&from=now-1y&to=now&viewPanel=8\r\n![utxo_set](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/1456708/2062707d-e256-46de-951c-d695966be4ef)\r\n\r\n[^2]: See for instance [this transaction](https://mempool.space/tx/6e463cf71ebc8a374fa4f43fb6c60ab16551ef666b4f72d67efaa8e88db8d1ca) and its [block](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000004261d7e1e194c3dd45c6f5d3e5c2d46268f0215a26280), which is filled with other BRC-20 inscriptions.

      "body": "I ran the numbers on bare multisig usage between blocks 700,000 and 800,000 (approx. last two years). Because most of bare multisig activity is never spent outputs, I focused on bare multisig inputs and how old the spent coins are.\r\n\r\nThere were 940 bare multisig inputs during the analyzed period. 28% of them were spending coins created in the same block, while the median coin age was 224 blocks, and 90% of the coins were 14,599 blocks or fewer old. So while the actual usage of bare multisig for transactions is low, it's not just people sweeping old wallets, and they would be negatively impacted by not being able to create new outputs.\r\n\r\nSo for now, assuming this change is adopted and the peer-to-peer network stops reliably relaying transactions creating bare multisig outputs, these appear to be the consequences:\r\n\r\n- People determined to store data in the UTXO set (which is a terrible idea, but they still do it) will move to a different output type (such as P2TR, or perhaps an unused 40-byte SegWit output type) with slightly lower encoding efficiency, with potentially worse consequences for the UTXO set size.\r\n- However, since the actual usage of bare multisig even for outputs is low, the actual consequences for the UTXO set are likely to be negligible either way.\r\n- A small minority of users who appear to actually be using bare multisig for transactions will be forced to move to a different output type.\r\n\r\nAs there don't appear to be any benefits of this change, it's a NACK from me.\r\n\r\nSide note, a proposal to change the default policy really should be accompanied (I'd even say preceded) by a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list.",

If you ACK this proposal everyone can have their slice of pie.\r\n\r\nIt is not contradictory if you understand how bitcoin works. This will create different mempool and P2P or incentivize a system that allows all transactions that follow consensus rules. It's a slippery slope.\r\n\r\nIf you think bare multisig is bad for multisig for bitcoin. Share on mailing list and see outcome.\r\n\r\nI want to see some transactions to be non standard? Would you do it?\r\n\r\nUsers can still \"spam\" so there is no reason to change default in core. You don't even understand spam. Only being emotional and looking for attention.",

There are at least 200,000 BIP47 payment codes (that users have opted in to uploading to a public web directory) in the wild across three independent wallets - with more coming I am told. \r\n\r\nRegarding version 3 payment codes, we have fully implemented Version 3 of BIP47 into our wallet library ExtLibJ for over a year. See test vectors here https://code.samourai.io/wallet/ExtLibJ/-/blob/develop/src/test/java/com/samourai/wallet/bip47/rpc/obpp05/TestVectorsOBPP_RFC05.java\r\n\r\nI don't think it is wise to assume that no one is using BIP47 Version 3, nor should it be expected that developers come pay homage and plead their case to the maintainers and contributors of this repository as was suggested earlier in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you @Davidson-Souza and @1ma for thinking of BIP47 in the context of this PR",

      "body": "Concept NACK\r\n\r\n1. **This PR won't stop utxo set bloat.** This would not stop bloat of the UTXO set because P2PK still exists. P2MS is just P2PK with the ability to bake up to 2 more pubkeys to the chain even if those pubkeys don't actually have known private keys.\r\n\r\n2. **Long term storage** because of the nature of P2SH and P2WSH scripts for multisig. The user is responsible for not only their private keys but also the public keys to recreate the script to spend their funds. P2MS is an incredible alternative to this since the user is only responsible for the private keys since the script exists on chain.\r\n\r\n3. **Security** P2MS offers 256*m bits of security which is higher than the 160bits of a P2SH script. It will in the future be easier to try to find hash collisions for a P2SH address than it will be to try to use pollard's rho to factor the private key.\r\n\r\n4. **Reducing Dust / Fee planning** Placing the scripts on chain reduces the cost to spend the UTXO since the script doesn't have to be provided to spend. This reduces the amount of dust. An added benefit is that over time if/as fees rise users that used P2MS would actually get a discount when spending compared to script hash based methods.\r\n\r\n5. **Application Demand** Over time users discover creative solutions to problems or add features. Just because something isn't used often today. Doesn't mean that it wont have prevalence tomorrow. \r\n\r\n6. **Slippery Slope and Moral Hazard** Relay policies like this are a form of censorship in it's own way. Just because we may not like the way one group is using something and none the less paying shouldn't be a cause to implement these policies. Only if something is genuinely causing issues and reducing the value of the network should policies be considered. \r\n\r\n_Example. What happens if FALSE IF becomes contentious? Would we start to consider new relay policies then?_\r\n\r\nedit: penalization, disincentivization may be better terms than censorship. My brain just interprets this as a change to the incentive structure by making the cost of communication (relaying) higher for those that want to use P2MS.\r\n",

P2MS is just P2PK with the ability to bake up to 2 more pubkeys to the chain even if those pubkeys don't actually have known private keys.\r\n> 2. **Long term storage** because of the nature of P2SH and P2WSH scripts for multisig. The user is responsible for not only their private keys but also the public keys to recreate the script to spend their funds. P2MS is an incredible alternative to this since the user is only responsible for the private keys since the script exists on chain.\r\n> 3. **Security** P2MS offers 256*m bits of security which is higher than the 160bits of a P2SH script. It will in the future be easier to try to find hash collisions for a P2SH address than it will be to try to use pollard's rho to factor the private key.\r\n> 4. **Reducing Dust / Fee planning** Placing the scripts on chain reduces the cost to spend the UTXO since the script doesn't have to be provided to spend. This reduces the amount of dust. An added benefit is that over time if/as fees rise users that used P2MS would actually get a discount when spending compared to script hash based methods.\r\n> 5. **Application Demand** Over time users discover creative solutions to problems or add features. Just because something isn't used often today. Doesn't mean that it wont have prevalence tomorrow.\r\n> 6. **Slippery Slope and Moral Hazard** Relay policies like this are a form of censorship in it's own way.

This would roughly double the amount of data that someone would have to include in their tx making the data overhead prohibitively expensive to spam. The efficiency of data storage would also decrease since only 50% of the pubkey data would be usable (_the y component would not have valid data._ ) Since a compressed point is equal to a uncompressed point P2MS would be functionally equivalent for any developer or users that want to use P2MS as their custody solution. I also doubt anyone creating a standard P2MS or P2PK TX for monetary exchange would have any issue paying the overhead for their tx which would be a maximum of 96 bytes. \r\n\r\n### Aside\r\nJust scraped my UTXO set using https://github.com/in3rsha/bitcoin-utxo-dump and filtered my set for only p2ms keeping all row data and the total size is 278MB which is incredibly small even compared to P2PKH which sits at 1.9GB\r\n\r\nHere are some sizes to show how little data has actually bloated the UTXO set using P2MS and P2PK, even P2PKH uses far more space at ~10x.  _*script is the size of the serialized data only_\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/3104223/7b025ffa-80b7-411d-9a38-99a6710dc6e5)\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Thank you for your input @samouraiwallet.\r\n\r\nI admit that when I gave my ACK I thought this change was a no-brainer (for the reasons @mikeinspace exposed above) and now I'm conflicted. I wasn't aware of BIP47 v3, and in my personal opinion it is a valid use case. I've reviewed the extent of the work you and others have done on it in the last years and I've realized how extremely pissed you and the more privacy-focused Bitcoin community must be about this proposed change.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to say that as a full node runner I'm about equally pissed that you designed and implemented a legit use case for storing data onchain that I need to keep in the UTXO set, especially since BIP47 and Whirlpool's Tx0 have always used OP_RETURN. If BIP47 v3 took off and there were tens of millions of BIP47 v3 notification transactions (which would arguably be a good thing for privacy) it would also contribute to worsen the UTXO set bloat problem for no good reason.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid our main goals and time horizons are fundamentally at odds on this issue, so I maintain my ACK. You should have more leeway in 2023 to redesign BIP47 v3 on top of OP_RETURN than I'll have in 2050 to run a full node if bare multisig data storage for legit use cases were to take off from here on.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nTo those who argue against the change on the grounds that bare multisig data storage is not so bad **today**, I'd say that it shows that not a lot of people have cared about it so far, and that it's better to unstandardize it while that's the case. On these grounds I also support @Semisol's suggestion to unstandardize P2PK outputs.\r\n\r\nI wasn't aware of the technical advantages of P2MS over P2SH/P2WSH pointed out by @russeree and they also seem a valid objection to me, but still @vostrnad showed that bona fide P2MS seems to happen very rarely in practice, so given the downsides I don't think they're compelling enough for me.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nIn general, regarding data embedding onchain I think that 80-byte OP_RETURNs are the Schelling point that all camps find tolerable (here I'm excluding self-professed Bitcoin adversaries such as Mike).\r\n\r\nEven a good chunk of the people who are opposed to adding new standardness rules claim to only do so because they fear unintended consequences, and because this feels like a never-ending \"cat and mouse\" game. However this is just one way to frame this situation.\r\n\r\nAnother way to frame the situation is that Mike, Casey et al are unsuspecting QA engineers working for Bitcoin Core for free, doing what essentially amounts to fuzz testing of the script interpreter. I don't see why Core cannot freeride on the countless hours they spend looking for contrived ways to embed data onchain to timely maintain an evolving set of standardness rules that nudge users towards OP_RETURN. There surely are talented people that'd like to work on that. The next step in proactiveness would be setting up bounties for finding novel data envelopes that evade the latest spam filters and disclose them responsibly, so that they can be unstandardized before they explode like `OP_0` `OP_IF` did. Maybe it'd be enough motivation for some of these spammers to turn white-hat and do their thing in testnet and signet instead of mainnet.\r\n\r\nFinally, there's the issue of potential full-on tidal wave of off-band spam with this approach. Personally I'm skeptical of the spammers' ability to actually weaponize the miners against the system. For one, even if they are profit-driven they are also some of the most invested entities in Bitcoin's success. For the other, if off-band spam really got to a point where it threatens the system I guess they'd jack up the off-band fees to a point where it evens out. However I can't back this up, it's just what seems more likely to me.",

Citing from the [OBPP5](https://github.com/OpenBitcoinPrivacyProject/rfc/blob/master/obpp-05.mediawiki):\r\n> Alice's wallet should spend the notification change output at the next appropriate opportunity.\r\n\r\nJustus Ranvier designed it that way so that these notifications are more block space efficient and do not create any waste UTXOs on notification addresses like v1 does. He also thought about when these notification outputs should be created so that there really is no waste:\r\n> Wallets SHOULD prefer to create of notification outputs in any situation where a change output is required, if the wallet knows of the existence of any payment codes but has not yet sent a notification.",

Does a new BIP need to be constructed to obsolete [BIP0011?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0011.mediawiki) \r\n\r\nEdit: Digging deeper\r\n\r\n1. Technically there is not a need to replace a BIP to obsolete it. Per BIP002 ```When a Final BIP is no longer relevant, its status may be changed to Replaced or Obsolete (which is equivalent to Replaced). This change must also be objectively verifiable and/or discussed.```\r\n\r\n2. There is no precedent for obsoleting an 'active' BIP before. only BIP0064 has moved from draft->obsolete. \r\n\r\n3. The replaced option for the status of BIP0011 doesn't make sense unless there is a replacement for BIP11 outlining the reasons removing BIP0011 form isStandard improves BitCoin. **This doesn't make much sense because it would be a negation BIP**\r\n\r\n4. The context of BIP11 explicitly adding bare-multisig to isStandard() would force a change of status of the BIP if this got merged.\r\n\r\n_A personal thought: A BIP obsoleting change should have a larger and more diverse set of community discussion. Possibly even running it through the mailing list first. As it stands the ACKs/NACKs ratio doesn't even reach 2/3, currently at 64.5% ACK rate_\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit 2: Some additional thoughts and info** \r\n\r\n\r\nI ran some scripts against the stamps encoded P2MS transactions.

They absolutely do not care about the decentralization of Bitcoin and the consequences it has on the nodes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, on your graph we see that the demand for stamps is much calmer, but absolutely nothing prevents a new wave of stamps.
