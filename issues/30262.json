    "title": "Add bitcoind and bitcoin-cli to macOS release",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nCurrently the macOS downloads only contain bitcoin-qt.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have the other binaries as well, especially `bitcoin-cli`. Currently the user has to compile these themselves.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nE.g. for a Stratum v2 workshop the instructions for macOS have to completely different than for Linux, because the latter can use the command-line. https://github.com/plebhash/sv2-workshop\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIncluding them in the normal download zip, perhaps in a folder called \"Utilities\", so that it's visually distinct from the GUI icon.\r\n\r\nThis would increase the download size, but typically Mac users hang out in high bandwidth environments anyway.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\nA separate download package. This might make the release process more involved?\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nI vaguely remember an earlier discussion about this, but can't find it.",
