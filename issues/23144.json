    "title": "Plumb \"too-long-mempool-chain\" to RPC error for send/sendtoaddress",
    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIf coin selection fails as part of `send` or `sendtoaddress`, the error message returned to the RPC client is `Insufficient funds`, even if the actual cause is due to `too-long-mempool-chain`.  This is likely to alarm users unnecessarily, as they will believe this means their funds have permanently vanished rather than being temporarily inaccessible.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIf coin selection fails due to `too-long-mempool-chain`, the `send` and `sendtoaddress` methods should pass that error back to the RPC client, instead of `Insufficient funds`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nIt would be even nicer from a UX standpoint if the limit on mempool chain length were removed, but AIUI [that's a DoS vector](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/9752#issuecomment-281464014), so is not going to happen.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nApparently this is [already done for `sendrawtransaction`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10015#issuecomment-288597075).  The discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10015 is relevant (it appears that the PR was withdrawn for reasons unrelated to my request).\r\n",

The status quo is confusing to nontechnical users (source: personal experience providing tech support to users who think their funds have been stolen after seeing the \"Insufficient funds\" error code).\r\n\r\nFWIW I agree with @achow101 in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24502#issuecomment-1061742337 : \r\n\r\n> I think \"insufficient funds\" is too generic of an error message for coin selection failures as there are a ton of different reasons why coin selection might fail. I would like to have more granular error messages\r\n",

Please try sending\r\na smaller amount or manually consolidating your wallet's UTXOs\".\r\n\r\n2) If the user pre-selected inputs and disallowed the automatic coin\r\n   selection process (no other inputs are allowed), we now will\r\n   return: \r\n-> \"The preselected coins total amount does not cover the transaction\r\ntarget. Please allow other inputs to be automatically selected or include\r\nmore coins manually\".\r\n\r\n3) The double-counted preset inputs during Coin Selection error will now\r\nthrow an \"internal bug detected\" message instead of crashing the node.\r\n\r\nThe essence of this work comes from several comments:\r\n1. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26560#discussion_r1037395665\r\n2. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25729#discussion_r940619491\r\n3. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25269#pullrequestreview-1135240825\r\n4. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23144 (which is connected to #24845)",
