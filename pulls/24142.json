    "body": "With #24118 introducing sweep functionality, there is no reason to maintain the SubtractFeeFromOutputs (SFFO) behavior as its use case was to do sweeping. So it is now deprecated and usage of it via the RPC will require `-deprecatedrpc=sffo`. The functionality has also been removed from the GUI. The tests have been updated to either use sweep, not use SFFO, or have `-deprecatedrpc=sffo` as necessary.\r\n\r\nThere will be a followup which removes SFFO entirely.\r\n\r\nThere is also a change to `IsDeprecatedRPCEnabled` as there were linker errors for `bitcoin-wallet` with the normal way that it is used.\r\n\r\nRequired #24118.",

          "title": "Add 'sendall' RPC née sweep",
          "body": " Add sendall RPC née sweep\r\n\r\n_Motivation_\r\nCurrently, the wallet uses a fSubtractFeeAmount (SFFO) flag on the\r\nrecipients objects for all forms of sending calls. According to the\r\ncommit discussion, this flag was chiefly introduced to permit sweeping\r\nwithout manually calculating the fees of transactions. However, the flag\r\nleads to unintuitive behavior and makes it more complicated to test\r\nmany wallet RPCs exhaustively. We proposed to introduce a dedicated\r\n`sendall` RPC with the intention to cover this functionality.\r\n\r\nSince the proposal, it was discovered in further discussion that our\r\nproposed `sendall` rpc and SFFO have subtly different scopes of\r\noperation.\r\n• sendall:\r\n  Use _given UTXOs_ to pay a destination the remainder after fees.\r\n• SFFO:\r\n  Use a _given budget_ to pay an address the remainder after fees.\r\n\r\nWhile `sendall` will simplify cases of spending a given set of\r\nUTXOs such as paying the value from one or more specific UTXOs, emptying\r\na wallet, or burning dust, we realized that there are some cases in\r\nwhich SFFO is used to pay other parties from a limited budget,\r\nwhich can often lead to the creation of change outputs. This cannot be\r\neasily replicated using `sendall` as it would require manual\r\ncomputation of the appropriate change amount.\r\n\r\nAs such, sendall cannot replace all uses of SFFO, but it still has a\r\ndifferent use case and will aid in simplifying some wallet calls and\r\nnumerous wallet tests.\r\n\r\n_Sendall call details_\r\nThe proposed sendall call builds a transaction from a specific\r\nsubset of the wallet's UTXO pool (by default all of them) and assigns\r\nthe funds to one or more receivers. Receivers can either be specified\r\nwith a given amount or receive an equal share of the remaining\r\nunassigned funds. At least one recipient must be provided without\r\nassigned amount to collect the remainder. The `sendall` call will\r\nnever create change. The call has a `send_max` option that changes the\r\ndefault behavior of spending all UTXOs (\"no UTXO left behind\"), to\r\nmaximizing the output amount of the transaction by skipping uneconomic\r\nUTXOs. The `send_max` option is incompatible with providing a specific\r\nset of inputs.\r\n\r\n---\r\nEdit: Replaced OP with latest commit message to reflect my updated motivation of the proposal.",

Semantically it is very similar to the existing `multi()` descriptor, but with the following changes:\r\n* The corresponding script is `<key1> OP_CHECKSIG <key2> OP_CHECKSIGADD <key3> OP_CHECKSIGADD ... <key_n> OP_CHECKSIGADD <k> OP_NUMEQUAL`, rather than the traditional `OP_CHECKMULTISIG`-based script, making it usable inside the `tr()` descriptor.\r\n* The keys can optionally be specified in x-only notation.\r\n* Both the number of keys and the threshold can be as high as 999; this is the limit due to the consensus stacksize=1000 limit\r\n\r\nI expect that this functionality will later be replaced with a miniscript-based implementation, but I don't think it's necessary to wait for that.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n* The wallet code will for not estimate witness size incorrectly for script path spends, which may result in a (dramatic) fee underpayment with large multi_a scripts.\r\n* The multi_a script construction is (slightly) suboptimal for n-of-n (where a `<key1> OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY ... <key_n-1> OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY <key_n> OP_CHECKSIG` would be better). Such a construction is not included here.",

          "body": "The current taproot signing code will end up creating transactions which do not meet the feerate target. This is primarily seen when spending a taproot output with the script path. In this scenario, because the public key is known, the dummy signer would incorrectly choose to create a dummy signed transaction that used the key path spend when the actual transaction would use script path. This results in a transaction that has a significantly lower fee rate because script path spends are much larger than key path spends. This is fixed by choosing the witness with the largest stack size rather than the smallest when doing size estimation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this change can result in massively overestimating the transaction fees which is undesirable. More discussion is needed to find a good solution to avoiding that problem.\r\n\r\nThere is an additional issue in the PSBT workflow where the sighash type would be appended during finalizing, but not during size estimation. That results in a transaction that is slightly larger than estimated so there is a lower feerate. This is resolved by having the DUMMY_MAXIMUM_SIGNATURE_CREATOR include the sighash type so that when funding with a watchonly wallet, we will estimate enough fee for the largest possible signature (as we do for ECDSA with high R).\r\n\r\nTests are updated to catch these case. `wallet_taproot.py` will now use a set feerate and check if the result meets that feerate.",

You are essentially sweeping a list of specific UTXOs rather than a list of all UTXOs in the wallet. So sweep can be extended to take a list of specific UTXOs and just spend those. That way we don't need to maintain any SFFO logic. It really is not necessary to keep SFFO in coin selection logic if you aren't going to even use the coin selection logic by restricting to a specific set of UTXOs.",

Coin selection is already a multivariate analysis - we have to consider fees, whether a change may be created, the waste metric, etc. There are edge cases when values are near the balance or near dust. All of these things make analyzing coin selection fairly difficult. SFFO is another variable in that analysis, and it can and has caused issues with reasoning about what coin selection is going to do in certain scenarios (while working on #17331, I remember pulling my hair out trying to work out the logic to get SFFO to behave correctly and not interfere with the rest of coin selection). By removing it, we simplify this analysis and thus make it easier to reason about any changes to coin selection logic in the future. Having SFFO has already bitten us in the past, keeping it will surely bite us again in the future. Dealing with SFFO is far more than the extra for loop to reduce the output amounts. It has effects on the actual coin selection logic as it changes what value we use for each input (we use the real value instead of effective value with SFFO on).\r\n\r\nThe second sending function for sweep is very simple and so it is easy to maintain. It does not execute any coin selection logic at all - all UTXOs will be selected, no need to execute any algorithms to figure that out. While adding a second function is certainly a maintenance burden, removing SFFO is a much more significant reduction in maintenance that I am okay with the tradeoff.\r\n\r\n> In any case, it doesn't seem great if the main justification for the UI change is a vague complaint about code maintenance. \r\n\r\n> If having separate spend and sweep functions actually provides a better UI, that could make sense. But it doesn't seem like UI benefits have been explained anywhere (release notes in #24118 would be a good place to brag about them).\r\n\r\nThe sweep function certainly provides a better UI for sweeping a wallet than SFFO does. Instead of having to lookup the balance, specify the balance in the amount, and then specify output indices for SFFO, sweep is a simple function that does exactly what the name suggests. Furthermore, because sweep does not rely on actual coin selection logic, changes to coin selection logic will not unexpectedly break sweep.\r\n\r\n> What was the previous \"unintuitive behavior\"?\r\n\r\nThere have been a couple of bug reports with using SFFO where it fails unexpectedly or does something weird with the fees (#23026, #10034). There have also been some issues opened where users who specify a value near the balance results in the entire balance being unexpectedly spent (#16100).\r\n\r\n> Why is the new behavior more intuitive? Are there existing workflows broken by the new UI? Are there new workflows enabled by the new UI or simplified by it?\r\n\r\nSweep is unambiguous as to what it is going to do - it is going to spend all of the UTXOs in the wallet and send the amount (minus fees) to the specified address(es). It won't be broken by coin selection logic changes because it always chooses every UTXO.",

      "body": "Great feedback! Thank you for clarifying that. I didn't realize:\r\n\r\n- The reason that sweep() implementation can be simpler than send(subtract_from_outputs=true) is that the sweep() implementation only has to support manual coin selection, while the send implementation also supports automatic coin selection.\r\n\r\n- The reason that sweep() implementation is preferable to users is that it doesn't force them make additional calls to find out their balance().\r\n\r\nI'm still skeptical about some things:\r\n\r\n- It's hard to buy the claim that this is a code simplification and good for maintenance when PR adds and duplicates hundreds of lines of code without removing much. I understand your frustration with #17331, but the previous code was god-awful, and the new code is much better (thanks to your efforts!). And the edge cases have been discussed, debugged, documented, and have good test coverage. So deprecating subtract from outputs at this point almost seems like a revenge-killing. If you want to add a sweep RPC that calls just wraps the send code setting subtract=true, that seems like it would be more straightforward to review, and better for long term maintenance, without a duplicate implementation and different set of tests.\r\n\r\n- I still don't know actual use-cases where subtract from outputs has done something bad or harmful or unexpected. To me seems like a straightforward and useful option and like a **simplifying** concept. In a typical bitcoin transaction, amount received is less than than amount sent due to fees, coin selection, etc. So when you create a transaction you have to decide whether you will fix the receive amount, and let the send amount vary. Or fix the send amount and let the receive amount vary. And \"subtract from outputs\" is toggle for doing that. Any time you don't care about receiver receiving an exact quantity (sending between wallets, depositing to an exchange or other online service) your ~probably~ may want to use this option. It seems unfortunate to me if it goes away. I assume people are using it as part of their existing workflows too, but I guess we will have have to find out about that.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Changed \"probably\" -> \"may.\" In typical case you need to create a change output anyway so using option provides no benefit\r\n",

The conclusion was that SFFO does seem to have a use case outside of sweep, and many contributors do not want to see it go. However many people do use SFFO to sweep, and that would still be better served with a dedicated sweep function.\r\n\r\nSo the current idea is to still introduce sweep, and to direct people to use that instead of SFFO if the intention appears to be sweep. This makes it easier for us to reason about edge cases with values near the balance as SFFO will no longer need to be considered.",

          "title": "wallet: Sweep function and deprecating subtractFeeFromOutputs",
          "body": "The subtractFeeFromOutputs function has long been the cause of many issues in coin selection. It is unclear whether it is being used for things other than sweeping the entire wallet balance, and sweeping specific inputs (i.e. spending inputs without creating change and without figuring out the feerate manually). Many issues opened about subtractFeeFromOutputs indicate that users are using it for sweeping, and the linked issue in the PR that adds it also discusses sweeping as the intended feature. Instead of using subtractFeeFromOutputs in order to implement this feature, it makes more sense to me to add specific functionality for sweeping. This would allow us to de-complicate our coin selection code by removing subtractFeeFromOutputs.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThere are a few specific things that I would want to see in a sweep function, besides the obvious spending all UTXOs with one destination.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that users will want to sweep to multiple destinations, so the sweep function should optionally allow users to specify amounts with addresses. If no amount is provided for an address, then the remaining value being swept will be sent to that address. Furthermore, multiple addresses may have no amount specified, in which case the remainder is split equally among the addresses, much in the same way that subtractFeeFromOutputs currently distributes the fee among the outputs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, sweeping may be used to sweep only specific inputs. So this sweep function should be able to allow users to specify which inputs to use. All specified inputs should be spent. If no inputs are provided, then the entire wallet will be spent.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways this could be implemented. The obvious is a new RPC with an API similar to `send` so that all of the relevant options can be provided. This would allow for a psbt to be returned in the case that the wallet does not have private keys, or if the user requests it. Another way would be to add it as an option to `send`, however I don't think that the API for using it would be easy to understand. For the GUI, there should be a dedicated button.\r\n\r\nInternally, it should be completely separate from existing coin selection (i.e. not in `CreateTransaction`, `SelectCoins`, or `AttemptSelection`).\r\n\r\nLastly, when sweep is implemented, subtractFeeFromOutputs should be added to `-deprecatedrpc` and the option removed from the GUI. Users should be informed that they can use the sweep function if that is what they are doing. Otherwise they can open an issue to discuss their use case. After one (or two) major release with `-deprecatedrpc` and no users complaining about a use case for subtractFeeFromOutputs that was not sweeping, then the subtractFeeFromOutputs option can be removed and the code for handling it removed from coin selection.",

          "body": "In wallet-related functional tests we often want to send funds to an address and  use the resulting (non-change) UTXO directly after as input for another transaction. Doing that is currently tedious, as it involves finding the index part of the outpoint manually by calling helpers like `find_vout_for_address` or `find_output` first.  This results in two different txid/vout variables which then again have to be combined to a single dictionary `{\"txid\": ..., \"vout\": ...}` in order to be specified as input for RPCs like `createrawtransaction` or `createpsbt`. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntxid1 = node1.sendtoaddress(addr1, value1)\r\nvout1 = find_vout_for_address(node1, txid1, addr1)\r\ntxid2 = node2.sendtoaddress(addr2, value2)\r\nvout2 = find_vout_for_address(node2, txid2, addr2)\r\nnode.createrawtransaction([{'txid': txid1, 'vout': vout1}, {'txid': txid2, 'vout': vout2}], .....)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a helper `create_outpoints` to immediately return the outpoint as\r\nUTXO dictionary in the common format, making the tests more readable and avoiding unnecessary duplication:\r\n\r\n```\r\nutxo1 = self.create_outpoints(node1, outputs=[{addr1: value1}])[0]\r\nutxo2 = self.create_outpoints(node2, outputs=[{addr2: value2}])[0]\r\nnode.createrawtransaction([utxo1, utxo2], .....)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTests are switched to work with UTXO-objects rather than two individual txid/vout variables accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe `find_output` helper is removed, as it seems generally a bad idea to search for an outpoint only based on the output value. If that's really ever needed in the future, it makes probably more sense to add it as an additional parameter to `find_vout_of_address`. Note that `find_output` supported specifying a block-hash for where to look for the transaction (being passed on to the `getrawtransaction` RPC). This seems to be unneeded, as txids are always unique and for the only test that used that parameter (rpc_psbt.py) there was no observed difference in run-time, so it was not reintroduced in the new helper.\r\n\r\nThere are still some `find_vout_of_address` calls remaining, used for detecting change outputs or for whenever the sending happens via `sendrawtransaction` instead, so this PR tackles not all, but the most common case.",

The original issue also recommends sweeping all value from keys in this category, I think that feature can be discussed in the future as a follow-up.\r\n\r\nThis PR also patches `PKDescriptor` from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22051 where matching public keys were not returned.\r\n\r\nFollow-up PR for the GUI: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/723",

So instead assume the most expensive between all script paths and the key path will be used.\r\n\r\nThis is still not ideal, as there may be a huge gap between the size of a script path spend and a key path spend.

The easiest form would take a fixed amount (e.g. 500 sat), a more advanced version would take a relative fee rate (e.g. reduce output such that fee rate increases by 5 sats/byte). For either case it would not add new inputs, so there's no coin selection involved.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that only fixes the use case of fee bumping, not the first transaction.",
