    "body": "### This PR aims at improving Bitcoin Core fee estimation\r\n\r\n\r\n### The objectives of this improvement are to:\r\n\r\n- Reduce overestimation done by the current `CBlockPolicyEstimator`\r\n- Make the fee estimator aware of the state of the mempool, allowing it to respond to changing conditions immediately.\r\n- Empower node users to be self-sovereign and use their node's estimates, as is now, the majority rely on third parties for fee estimation.\r\n- Simplify the process of adding new fee estimation strategies in the future.\r\n\r\nThe PR creates a new `FeeEstimator` class which is responsible for getting estimates from one or more subscribed `Forcaster`'s.\r\n\r\nA `Forcaster` will register with the `FeeEstimator` as being able to provide estimates, and when an estimate is requested, should return two fee rate estimates (high and low) and a confidence level.\r\n\r\nThe estimator will then take (currently undecided):\r\n1. the lowest estimated rate, or\r\n1. the weighted average of all the estimated rates\r\n\r\n...and return the two 'high' and 'low' estimations to the user.\r\n\r\nThe `FeeEstimator` also owns access to the legacy estimator, accessible via a pointer.\r\n\r\nThis PR deliberately does **not** try to modify existing fee estimation code, but instead uses new modules with cleaner seperation. This will make new code and interfaces much easier to introduce, and also make it easier to, if desired in the future, drop legacy estimation code.\r\n\r\n### Currently, this PR implements two forecasters:\r\n\r\n1. Mempool-based forecaster (`MemPoolForecaster`): It estimates fees simply by generating a block template from the node's mempool and returns the 25th and 50th percentile mining scores as low-priority and high-priority fee estimates, respectively.\r\n1. Last 6 Blocks forecaster (`BlockForecaster`): Uses the transactions from the previous six blocks _which were also seen in the node's mempool_, to make an estimate.\r\n\r\n    It listens to the validation interface notifications for removed mempool transactions, linearizes the transactions using a mini miner, and saves the 25th and 50th percentile mining scores. When estimating fees, it averages the mining scores of the percentiles from the last six mined blocks.\r\n    \r\n    NB. As this **excludes** transactions that never entered the node's mempool, it's likely to undershoot slightly\r\n\r\nThese two forecasters both estimate fees for (1, 2) block confirmation targets, referred to as \"as soon as possible (ASAP)\" fee rate estimates.\r\n\r\nFor both forcasters use of RBF is strongly recommended in order that transactions can be fee-bumped if desired.\r\n\r\n### Next steps:\r\n\r\n- Give some statistics of estimates \"missing the block\" (~percentage of estimates below the 5th percentile mining score of the confirmed block) and \"over paying\" (~percentage of estimates above the 25th 50th and 75th percentiles mining score) \r\n\r\n- Extend the feature to the wallet; currently it's only exposed in an RPC `estimatefee`.\r\n- Update forecasters to return confidence levels in their estimates.\r\n\r\n### Confidence levels\r\n\r\nConfidence levels are determined by heuristics.\r\n\r\nFor the mempool-based forecaster:\r\n\r\n- Suspected high mining score transactions should be confirmed but aren't.\r\n- Most transactions in previously mined blocks were in our node's mempool.\r\n- High mining score mempool transactions are confirmed.\r\n\r\nFor the last 6 blocks forecaster:\r\n\r\n- Presence of empty blocks in the last 6 blocks.\r\n- Most of the last 6 blocks' transactions were seen in the node's mempool or not.\r\n\r\nThe fee estimator  will select the fee rate from the forecasters based on confidence level instead of just taking the lowest fee rate estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How does this fit in with `CBlockPolicyEstimator`?\r\n\r\nThis fee estimator owns the legacy `CBlockPolicyEstimator` and does not change any of its interfaces. The wallet still uses `estimatesmartfee`, and RPCs also access it through the Fee Estimator.\r\nHowever, this will change when we switch to using estimates from `GetFeeEstimateFromForecasters`, which works much better than the `estimatesmartfee` in (1, 2) confirmation target scenarios.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when we have another forecaster that supports confirmation targets beyond (1, 2) and works better than `estimatesmartfee`, we will eventually phase out `CBlockPolicyEstimator` as the new Fee Estimator module makes it easy to do so.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses two open issues and has been requested by users in the past.\r\n\r\n#27995\r\n#30009\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n1. **Will miners broadcast high fee rate transactions, and then evict them with a conflicting transaction in the next block, trick users of this fee estimator into making transactions with high fees?**\r\n   https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/6?u=ismaelsadeeq\r\n\r\n   This PR addresses this concern by ensuring that the fee estimate does not surge immediately whenever this happens the mempool based forecaster estimate will be higher than last 6 block forecaster estimate. As such the last six blocks forecaster estimate will be returned, preventing users to be victims of this attack.\r\n\r\n2. **In times of high confirmation times or high block space demand, fee estimates tend to rise. If the mempool-based forecaster estimate rises, the fee estimator will fall back to the last six blocks fee estimate, if it's low, will that make transactions constructed with the estimate get stuck in the mempool?**\r\nThe ASAP fee estimate provides an estimate for transactions to confirm in the next one or two blocks. During periods of high confirmation times, fee rates rise due to congestion. Once a block is mined, the mempool clears high mining score transactions, making room for lower fee rate transactions. If congestion recurs and the transaction is time-sensitive, users can safely fee bump assuming it's an RBF-enabled transaction.\r\nIn times of immediate high block demand, if the mempool-based fee estimate surges while the last six blocks fee estimate is low, users can fee bump their transactions if they take longer to confirm. As more blocks are mined, the last six blocks forecaster will adjust and reflect the higher fee rates. When demand decreases, the mempool forecaster will immediately respond to the new conditions by providing a lower fee estimate and the fee estimator will return it instead.\r\n\r\n3. **Currently, getting a block template is expensive. How do you tackle that in the mempool-based forecaster?**\r\nThe forecaster cache the recently generated fee rate estimates and only generate a new block template when the time delta between the recent estimate and the current time exceeds 30 seconds.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is a collaborative work with @willcl-ark and a result of collecting insight from other contributors.\r\n",

There is also no clear enforcement on when and in what order they need to be initialized. The caches are always initialized in the `BasicTestingSetup` although a number of tests don't actually need them.\r\n\r\nSolve this by moving the caches from global scope into the `ChainstateManager` class. This simplifies the usage of the kernel library by no longer requiring manual setup of the caches prior to using the `ChainstateManager`. Tests that need to access the caches can instantiate them independently.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis pull request is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).",

          "body": "This PR:\r\n- moves warnings from common to the node library and into the node namespace (as suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29845#discussion_r1570069541)\r\n- generalizes the warnings interface to `Warnings::Set()` and `Warnings::Unset()` methods, instead of having a separate function and globals for each warning. As a result, this simplifies the `kernel::Notifications` interface.\r\n- removes warnings.cpp from the kernel library\r\n- removes warning globals\r\n- adds testing for the warning logic\r\n\r\nBehaviour change introduced:\r\n- the `-alertnotify` command is executed for all `KernelNotifications::warningSet` calls, which now also covers the `LARGE_WORK_INVALID_CHAIN` warning\r\n- the GUI is updated automatically whenever a warning is (un)set, covering some code paths where it previously wouldn't be, e.g. when `node::AbortNode()` is called, or for the `LARGE_WORK_INVALID_CHAIN` warning\r\n\r\nSome discussion points:\r\n- ~is `const std::string& id` the best way to refer to warnings? Enums are an obvious alternative, but since we need to define warnings across libraries, strings seem like a straightforward solution.~ _edit: updated approach to use `node::Warning` and `kernel::Warning` enums._",

          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNext step after this PR is done will be to have the wallet do the private broadcast as well, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11887 would have to be resolved.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Move `Split` functions from `util/spanparsing.h` to `util/string.h`, using `util` namespace for clarity.\r\n- Move remaining spanparsing functions to `script/parsing.h` since they are used for descriptor and miniscript parsing.\r\n- Combine `util/fees.h` and `util/errors.h` into `common/messages.h` so there is a place for simple functions that generate user messages to live, and these functions are not part of the util library.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this change is that the util library is a dependency of the kernel, and we should remove functionality from util that shouldn't be called by kernel code or kernel applications. These changes should also improve code organization and make functions easier to discover. Some of these same moves are (or were) part of #28690, but did not help with code organization, or made it worse, so it is better to move them and clean them up in the same PR so code only has to change one time.\r\n",

      "body": "> The state of the node's mempool may not accurately reflect the state of others' mempools, and not even its own mempool when the block is found in the future. It isn't a good single source of information.\r\n\r\nCorrect. The rationale behind this set of changes can be summed up briefly as follows:\r\n\r\n- Add a new standalone modular fee estimation manager to which (many) `Forcasters` can be trivially added or removed (vs modifying `BlockPolicyEstimator`).\r\n- Provide two forcaster implementations which do not exist today ( 1. mempool-based and 2. previous-6-blocks-seen-in-mempool) to demonstrate functionality.\r\n\r\nIn the present, there is a strong tendency for users of Bitcoin Core to consult external fee estimation services when they want timely (next 1 or 2 blocks) confirmation of transactions, whilst also not overpaying. Examples of these include mempool.space, whatthefee.io, Samourai's [nextblock.is](https://blog.samourai.is/introducing-nextblock-fee-estimator/) (now down), [johoe](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,1w,weight), [blockchair](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin) etc., with more popping up every month.\r\n\r\nWe also analysed/estimated Bitcoin Core users not using in-built estimation in a post [here](https://hackmd.io/@kEyqkad6QderjWKtcBF5Hg/cChallengies-with-estimating-transaction-fees).\r\n\r\nIn our opinion having users feel the need to use external fee estimation services that they could equally have served to them by their own node, feels sub-optimal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, when users do use the current Bitcoin Core fee estimator, there are often times when they end up overpaying, see delving bitcoin post [Mempool based fee estimation](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703) and various issues over the years e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30009 . This is avoidable.\r\n\r\nWork from a student of @renepickhardt [link](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/12) demonstrated something we also measured independently -- that bitcoin core's current estimates are often overpaying significantly following fee spikes. This effect can be directly mitigated by using a mempool-based estimation.\r\n\r\n>  Perhaps it is a good idea to use it as a secondary source, but probably it should only ever adjust fee estimations upward, not down.\r\n\r\nIn this changeset we take the approach of using the lowest result from all \"confident\" `Forcasters`. The rationale is that we expect users wanting fast confirmation to have RBF enabled, allowing them to bump fees if we still undershoot.\r\n\r\nComments from @harding [link](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/6) explained that it may be possible for miners to _artificially_ increase a strictly-mempool-based fee-rate. By taking the lower (confident) result from `n` `Forcasters`, we attempt to protect against this attack (and others like it), at the potential cost of having to RBF.\r\n\r\nWe do plan to add additional sanity checks to the mempool-based Forcaster as described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27995, but these are not yet implemented. In any case, even without these additional checks we have been seeing much-improved short time-scale estimations from Bitcoin Core.",

          "body": "MiniWallet allows to create padded transactions that are equal or slightly above a certain `target_weight` (first introduced in PR #25379, commit 1d6b438ef0ccd05e1522ac38b44f847c1d93e72f), which can be useful especially for mempool-related tests, e.g. for policy limit checks or scenarios to trigger mempool eviction. Currently the `target_weight` parameter doesn't play together with `fee_rate` though, as the fee calculation is incorrectly based on the tx vsize before the padding output is added, so the fee-rate is consequently far off. This means users are forced to pass an absolute fee, which can be quite inconvenient and leads to lots of duplicated \"calculate absolute fee from fee-rate and vsize\" code with the pattern `fee = (feerate / 1000) * (weight // 4)` on the call-sites.\r\n\r\nThis PR first improves the tx padding itself to be more accurate, adds a functional test for it, and fixes the `fee_rate` treatment for the `{create,send}_self_transfer` methods. (Next step would be to enable this also for the `_self_transfer_multi` methods, but those currently don't even offer a `fee_rate` parameter). Finally, the ability to pass both `target_weight` and `fee_rate` is used in the `mempool_limit.py` functional test. There might be more use-cases in other tests, that could be done in a follow-up.",

          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. Compared to #28983 it introduces EllSwift in the handshake and fixes various bugs. I used that opportunity to change the branch name, which makes testing against [SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) slightly easier. There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #30200\r\n- [ ] #29295\r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #30205\r\n\r\n### Related useful issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] #30209\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [x] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick). [DONE, see [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/research-into-the-effects-of-a-cluster-size-limited-mempool-in-2023/794/1)]\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add duplicate transactions to the mempool (#29990).\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts.

It could be expanded further so that `rpc/mining.cpp` no longer needs `EnsureMemPool` and `EnsureChainman`.\r\n\r\nThis PR should be a pure refactor.",
