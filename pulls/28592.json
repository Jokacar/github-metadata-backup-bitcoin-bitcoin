In this event, the per-peer inventory queues can grow too large.\r\n\r\nThis commit bumps the rate up to 14 tx/s (for inbound peers), increasing the safety margin by a factor of 2.\r\n\r\nOutbound peers continue to receive relayed transactions at 2.5x the rate of inbound peers, for a rate of 35tx/second.",

With this change, going through `m_tx_inventory_to_send` will be more predictable and reactive, making the tx relay smoother.\r\n\r\nI also checked that the `catch up` code introduced in 5b3406094f2679dfb3763de4414257268565b943 still makes sense. (I think the commit message from there better be in the code because the `division by 1000` is not trivial).\r\nI think catching up will become slower in the case when `m_tx_inventory_to_send` is around 1,000,000; but I think it's fine.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI also want to note that it's not exactly the relay rate, it's the rate of going through the queue. Because some transactions won't be relayed e.g. due to the fee filter.",
