    "body": "v0.10.0rc1 on Windows 7\nNode was off line for 5 days. After startup, block loading and verification, downloading of new blocks started. and began normally.  Age counted down from 5 to 3 days.  At this point, age ceased to count down on the main window and the processed block number on the main window and the Help Information window was unchanging. Looking at the Help Network Traffic window it looked like the network IO had been completed.  Windows task manager showed that all processor cores were busy servicing Bitcoin Core.  The program appeared to be hung, except that the two windows responded to mouse actions.  Checking the Debug Log it appeared that blocks were being processed and logged normally at the usual high speed. The problem appeared to be a lagging user interface display, not an actual lag in processing.\n\nWhen catchup happened, the progress display still showed 3 days of blocks to catch up just before it disappeared and the green check mark appeared.\n",

      "body": "I agree that the new way is preferable to the old hard GUI hang.  I reported this primarily because it might be system dependent and hence hadn't been seen yet. Also, at least on my system it is repeatable.\n\nThere may be a related problem during block acquisition whereby all network activity ceases for several minutes while downloading but all the blocks haven't yet been downloaded.  In this case, the difference would be that the system would be quiescent with no processor, disk or network activity but unfetched blocks available on peers or fetched but not being processed by the CPU.  At the time I suspected this was happening it was not repeatable, which is why I didn't report it.  If this actually happened then it would be a performance bug and would affect timing of initial bock acquisition.  Probably not a low priority cosmetic bug (unless it was rare and unique to my system) but definitely not a high priority bug either.\n",

          "body": "While bitcoin-qt is downloading the chain to synchronize with the network, opening the coin control dialog box makes the GUI unresponse with no notification to the user on what is occuring. This is duplicatable behavior for me, and gui lockup time varied from as high as a minute to as low as 8 second. As soon as the blockchain is syncronized, no gui lockup occurs.\n\nStep 1: Open up a Bitcoin Core wallet that is behind on synchronization. Mine was behind about 48 hours, giving me a few minutes to test before synchronization was complete.\n\nStep 2: Go to the Send tab, and in the Coin Control Features box click 'Inputs...'. The app will no become unresponsive for roughly 30 seconds and after some time the coin selection dialog will eventually appear.\n\nStep 3: Try to reproduce after blockchain is fully syncronized. Notice that no more delay is occurring.\n\nVerified on Bitcoin Core version v0.10.1 (64-bit) linux. \n\nTheory: Verifying incoming blocks is taking a lot of CPU. Pulling up the Coin Selection dialog may also take some CPU to construct the Tree of Transactions. (My wallet was very small with only a few entries, but non the less my gui was still locking up.) Perhaps the app can prioritize building the Coin Selection window for the user over any background processes that are verifying blocks. The Background block verifying should be a lower priority background thread, though i admit I know little about how threading works or if this is what is actually causing the issue.\n",

          "body": "Bitcoin-qt v0.11.1 and now v0.11.2rc1  32 bit Windows, running on Win7 with 2GB ram.\n\nAt app startup, the splash screen runs through verifying and rescanning status messages fairly quickly, then gets \"stuck\" showing \"Activating best chain\" message. The disk is thrashing. Process memory use is under 300MB, total system memory use is 1.5GB out of 2GB available. CPU load (2 cores) bounces between 10 and 60%, but not pegged at 100%.  Disk use (as reported by Task Manage / Resource Manager) shows about 1MByte/sec read, 3MByte/sec write, with a disk queue length of around 2.5.\n\nAfter 1 to 2 HOURS, bitcoin-qt gets past the \"activating best chain\" message and opens the full UI window. The blockchain on this machine is 8 weeks out of date.\n\nWhile sync'ing to the network, the disk is still thrashing heavily and memory use has not increased above 300MB. The peer list shows it is attempting to connect to peers to ask for blocks, but most of the time the Ping Time shows as N/A and there is no user agent or other handshake info shown. The network use graph shows an occasional blip separated by 5 to 10 minutes of total network silence.\n\nTyping \"help\" in the Debug console window shows no response for nearly 30 seconds.\n\nThe disk thrashing doesn't appear to be caused by low memory page faults, because there's 500MB of free system memory available.\n\nIf I shut down the app (normal exit, not kill), wait for it to shut down, and then start it up again, it sits on the \"activating best chain\" message again for an hour or more.\n\nIs the v0.11.x build running a background thread to update the database and indices on disk?  When this machine was last fired up on main net, it was running Bitcoinqt v0.10.x. \n\nIt's doing a heckovalot of disk I/O with absolutely nothing coming in from the peer network.  Bitcoinqt is trying to connect to peers, but apparently can rarely can make it through the handshake before giving up and starting over.  This isn't a network or firewall/router/ISP saturation issue because this machine can't even manage a connection to another 0.11.0 peer on the local network which has an up-to-date blockchain. I was thinking I could get the machine \"caught up\" in a few minutes by -connect(ing) it to the up to date machine over the 1GB local ethernet, but it's barely able to connect at all.  \n\nNote that this machine normally runs bitcoinqt on testnet, and has shown none of this behavior. However, it's kept up to date, not 8 weeks behind there.\n\nAny idea what's going on?  Why is 0.11.x thrashing the disk so hard, even without incoming txs or blocks?\n",

          "body": "At the moment, the UI gets often not updated during initial sync or a catch-up of serval blocks. The UI's try_lock often can't acquire the lock which result in a bad user experience (\"Baby, it's not updating!\").\n\nThis PR changes the blocktip-update signal parameter form a bare hash (`uint256`) to a `CBlockIndex*`, which allows to safely get it's height and timestamp without locking anything. In addition, the blocktip-update signal now gets fired also during initial sync, but with an extra boolean flag that indicates the initial sync state.\nThe PR temporarily has a benchmark for the tip update signal. On my standard system it uses 0.03ms for the signal (=reasonable). Keep in mind that this signal is synchronous, but it will emit another asynchronous QT signal to the UI thread that will care about the UI update!\n\nThe timer based update (every 250ms) is still active for bandwidth and mempool UI observation, although there no cs_main lock is required.\n",
