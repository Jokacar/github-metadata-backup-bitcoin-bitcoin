    "body": "`CWallet::LoadWallet()` expects to be called after a `CWallet` is constructed, but before any of its member functions called. Doing so invalidates pointers which causes issues with some PRs and branches that I am working on. This was being used incorrectly in a few tests and benchmarks, resulting in segfaults.\r\n\r\nAs a precaution for this kind of issue in the future, I've also added a few asserts to `LoadWallet()` so that developers will notice when it is used incorrectly.\r\n\r\nAs similar issue was fixed in #27666",

This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

          "title": "wallet: Keep track of the wallet's own transaction outputs in memory",
          "body": "Currently, the wallet is not actually aware about its own transaction outputs. Instead, it will iterate all of the transactions stored in `mapWallet`, and then all of the outputs of those transactions, in order to figure out what belongs to it for the purposes of coin selection and balance calculation. For balance calculation, there is caching that results in it only iterating all of the transactions, but not all of the outputs. However when the cache is dirty, everything is iterated. This is especially problematic for wallets that have a lot of transactions, or transactions that have a lot of unrelated outputs (as may occur with coinjoins or batched payments).\r\n\r\nThis PR helps to resolve this issue by making the wallet track all of the outputs that belong to it in a new member `m_txos`. Note that this includes outputs that may have already been spent. Both balance calculation (`GetBalance`) and coin selection (`AvailableCoins`) are updated to iterate `m_txos`. This is generally faster since it ignores all of the unrelated outputs, and it is not slower as in the worst case of wallets containing only single output transactions, it's exactly the same number of outputs iterated.\r\n\r\n`m_txos` is memory only, and it is populated during wallet loading. When each transaction is loaded, all of its outputs are checked to see if it is `IsMine`, and if so, an entry added to `m_txos`. When new transactions are received, the same procedure is done.\r\n\r\nSince imports can change the `IsMine` status of a transaction (although they can only be \"promoted\" from watchonly to spendable), all of the import RPCs will be a bit slower as they re-iterate all transactions and all outputs to update `m_txos`.\r\n\r\nEach output in `m_txos` is stored in a new `WalletTXO` class. This class contains references to the parent `CWalletTx` and the `CTxOut` itself. It also caches the `IsMine` value of the txout. This should be safe as `IsMine` should not change unless there are imports. This allows us to have additional performance improvements in places that use these `WalletTXO`s as they can use the cached `IsMine` rather than repeatedly calling `IsMine` which can be expensive.\r\n\r\nThe existing `WalletBalance` benchmark demonstrates the performance improvement that this PR makes. The existing `WalletAvailableCoins` benchmark doesn't as all of the outputs used in that benchmark belong to the test wallet. I've updated that benchmark to have a bunch of unrelated outputs in each transaction so that the difference is demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a larger project to have the wallet actually track and store a set of its UTXOs.\r\n\r\nBuilt on #24914 as it requires loading the txs last in order for `m_txos` to be built correctly.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks:\r\n\r\nMaster:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       92,245,141.50 |               10.84 |    0.1% |  988,823,975.00 |  66,803,340.50 |    0.0% |      2.04 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            5,709.90 |          175,134.50 |    0.5% |       80,968.24 |      25,539.15 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|          139,396.17 |            7,173.80 |    0.6% |    1,383,390.50 |     430,276.86 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            5,055.80 |          197,792.47 |    0.3% |       80,968.10 |      25,539.02 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|                9.79 |      102,152,396.19 |    0.1% |          161.00 |          37.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,552,736.00 |              644.02 |    1.5% |   20,316,315.80 |     618,545.80 |    0.6% |      0.08 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|      114,114,732.00 |                8.76 |    0.5% |1,291,047,717.60 | 320,244,602.00 |    0.0% |      6.30 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      359,315,754.00 |                2.78 |    0.1% |4,339,447,818.00 | 136,619,757.00 |    0.7% |      1.80 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|       98,230,601.00 |               10.18 |    0.1% |  537,688,964.00 |  97,332,266.00 |    0.3% |      0.49 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n\r\nPR:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       75,319,868.50 |               13.28 |    0.2% |  863,758,229.00 |  30,892,593.00 |    0.2% |      1.66 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            2,367.62 |          422,364.95 |    1.0% |       35,785.05 |       9,893.01 |    0.2% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|            2,685.58 |          372,359.55 |    0.2% |       36,501.05 |      10,027.01 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            3,462.24 |          288,830.68 |    2.7% |       35,785.06 |       9,893.01 |    0.3% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|               11.65 |       85,838,176.97 |    0.1% |          180.00 |          42.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,563,092.60 |              639.76 |    1.5% |   20,426,154.40 |     649,953.80 |    0.6% |      0.09 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|       58,367,804.40 |               17.13 |    0.9% |  587,164,005.00 | 107,905,843.80 |    0.1% |      3.21 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      365,302,636.00 |                2.74 |    0.2% |4,349,345,147.00 | 138,730,668.00 |    0.8% |      1.83 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|      124,995,585.00 |                8.00 |    1.2% |  801,998,316.00 | 103,210,721.00 |    0.3% |      0.63 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n",
