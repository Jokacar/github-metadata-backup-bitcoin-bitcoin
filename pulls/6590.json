    "body": "The fix is debatable, but it points out the real issue: when testing with Windows, stale sockets from previous runs cause the current tests' listen sockets to be unavailable, leading to nodes that never sync. I'm sure that translates to real-world issues as well, for example watchdog scripts would likely fail to work as intended. I'm not sure if there's a more proper way to fix the problem for Windows, so I just copied the behavior we already use for Unix.\n\nThis may be part of the root cause of #6554, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nWith that fixed, these test run fine locally. Note that they do take quite a while to run though, so we might not want to enable them on Travis for every PR/push.\n",

Together with #4738 (convert json_spirit to UniValue), this rids Bitcoin Core of the worst offenders with regard to compile-time slowness.\n- _Replace spit-and-duct-tape http server with evhttp_. Front-end http handling is handled by libevent, a work queue (with configurable depth and parallelism) is used to handle application requests.\n- _Wrap HTTP request in C++ class_; this makes the application code mostly HTTP-server-neutral\n- _Refactor RPC to move all http-specific code to a separate file_. Theoreticaly this can allow building without HTTP server but with another RPC backend, e.g. Qt's debug console (currently not implemented) or future RPC mechanisms people may want to use.\n- _HTTP dispatch mechanism_; services (e.g., RPC, REST) register which URL paths they want to handle.\n\nBy using a proven, high-performance asynchronous networking library (also used by Tor) and HTTP server, problems such as #5674, #5655, #344 should be avoided.\n\nWhat works? bitcoind, bitcoin-cli, bitcoin-qt. Unit tests and RPC/REST tests pass. The aim for now is everything but SSL support.\n\nConfiguration options:\n- `-rpcthreads`: repurposed as \"number of  work handler threads\". Still defaults to 4.\n- `-rpcworkqueue`: maximum depth of work queue. When this is reached, new requests will return a 500 Internal Error.\n- `-rpctimeout`: inactivity time, in seconds, after which to disconnect a client.\n- `-debug=http`: low-level http activity logging\n\n(due to the separation of RPC and HTTP server, renaming these options may make sense, but I've kept this out of backwards compatiblity)\n\nTODO:\n- [x] ~~Build system (currently hardcodes libraries, so this will definitely not pass Travis)~~ (thanks @theuni)\n- [x] ~~REST and RPC register their own request handlers respectively~~\n- [x] ~~Qt debug console must register a RPCTimerInterface (to make timeouts in the debug console work with -server=0)~~\n- [x] ~~Interrupt/Shutdown flow needs to be cleaned up~~\n- [x]  ~~`[warn] event_active: event has no event_base set.` appears sometimes to the console. Seems to be harmless, but it is weird (see @ajweiss comments)~~\n",
