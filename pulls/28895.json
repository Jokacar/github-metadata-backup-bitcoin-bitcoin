    "body": "to allocate our limited outbound slots correctly, and to ensure addnode\r\nconnections benefit from their intended protections.\r\n\r\nOur addnode logic usually connects the addnode peers before the automatic\r\noutbound logic does, but not always, as a connection race can occur.  If an \r\naddnode peer disconnects us and if it was the only one from its network, there\r\ncan be a race between reconnecting to it with the addnode thread, and it being\r\npicked as automatic network-specific outbound peer.  Or our internet connection\r\nor router or the addnode peer could be temporarily offline, and then return\r\nonline during the automatic outbound thread.  Or we could add a new manual peer\r\nusing the addnode RPC at that time.\r\n    \r\nThe race can be more apparent when our node doesn't know many peers, or with\r\nnetworks like cjdns that currently have few bitcoin peers.\r\n    \r\nWhen an addnode peer is connected as an automatic outbound peer and is the only\r\nconnection we have to a network, it can be protected by our new outbound\r\neviction logic and persist in the \"wrong role\".\r\n    \r\nFinally, there does not seem to be a reason to make block-relay or short-lived\r\nfeeler connections to addnode peers, as the addnode logic will ensure we connect\r\nto them if they are up, within the addnode connection limit.\r\n    \r\nFix these issues by checking if the address is an addnode peer in our automatic\r\noutbound connection logic.\r\n",

If an\naddnode peer disconnects us and if it was the only one from its network, there\ncan be a race between reconnecting to it with the addnode thread, and it being\npicked as automatic network-specific outbound peer.  Or our internet connection\nor router, or the addnode peer, could be temporarily offline, and then return\nonline during the automatic outbound thread.  Or we could add a new manual peer\nusing the addnode RPC at that time.\n\nThe race can be more apparent when our node doesn't know many peers, or with\nnetworks like cjdns that currently have few bitcoin peers.\n\nWhen an addnode peer is connected as an automatic outbound peer and is the only\nconnection we have to a network, it can be protected by our new outbound\neviction logic and persist in the \"wrong role\".\n\nExamples on mainnet using logging added in the same pull request:\n\n2023-08-12T14:51:05.681743Z [opencon] [net.cpp:1949] [ThreadOpenConnections]\n[net:debug] Not making automatic network-specific outbound-full-relay connection\nto i2p peer selected for manual (addnode) connection: [geh...odq.b32.i2p]:0\n\n2023-08-13T03:59:28.050853Z [opencon] [net.cpp:1949] [ThreadOpenConnections]\n[net:debug] Not making automatic block-relay-only connection to onion peer\nselected for manual (addnode) connection: kpg...aid.onion:8333\n\n2023-08-13T16:21:26.979052Z [opencon] [net.cpp:1949] [ThreadOpenConnections]\n[net:debug] Not making automatic network-specific outbound-full-relay connection\nto cjdns peer selected for manual (addnode) connection: [fcc...8ce]:8333\n\n2023-08-14T20:43:53.401271Z [opencon] [net.cpp:1949] [ThreadOpenConnections]\n[net:debug] Not making automatic network-specific outbound-full-relay connection\nto cjdns peer selected for manual (addnode) connection: [fc7...59e]:8333\n\n2023-08-15T00:10:01.894147Z [opencon] [net.cpp:1949] [ThreadOpenConnections]\n[net:debug] Not making automatic feeler connection to i2p peer selected for\nmanual (addnode) connection: geh...odq.b32.i2p:8333\n\nFinally, there does not seem to be a reason to make block-relay or short-lived\nfeeler connections to addnode peers, as the addnode logic will ensure we connect\nto them if they are up, within the addnode connection limit.\n\nFix these issues by checking if the address is an addnode peer in our automatic\noutbound connection logic.",

          "body": "This is joint work with mzumsande. \r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to diversify outbound connections with respect to reachable networks. The existing logic evaluates peers for connection based purely on the frequency of available addresses in `AddrMan`. This PR adds logic to automatically connect to alternate reachable networks and adds eviction logic that protects one existing connection to each network. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if `AddrMan` is populated primarily with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and only a handful of onion addresses, it is likely that we won't establish any automatic outbound connections to Tor, even if we're capable of doing so. For smaller networks like CJDNS, this is even more of an issue and often requires adding manual peers to ensure regularly being connected to the network.\r\n\r\nConnecting to multiple networks improves resistance to eclipse attacks for individual nodes. It also benefits the entire p2p network by increasing partition resistance and privacy in general. \r\n\r\nThe automatic connections to alternate networks is done defensively, by first filling all outbound slots with random addresses (as in the status quo) and then adding additional peers from reachable networks the node is currently not connected to. This approach ensures that outbound slots are not left unfilled while attempting to connect to a network that may be unavailable due to a technical issue or misconfiguration that bitcoind cannot detect.\r\n\r\nOnce an additional peer is added and we have one more outbound connection than we want, outbound eviction ensures that peers are protected if they are the only ones for their network.\r\n\r\nManual connections are also taken into account: If a user already establishes manual connections to a trusted peer from a network, there is no longer a need to make extra efforts to ensure we also have an automatic connection to it (although this may of course happen by random selection). \r\n",

They might now be protected from eviction due to network-specific extra peers, but that eviction is also new: Before #27213, we only had the stale-tip eviction, and I think that it would only extremely rarely evict such a peer because of the way it works (see [this post](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28248#issuecomment-1812702510) for why I think so), so once an automatic connections was made, it was probably never evicted unless there were other causes like we got offline or they disconnected us.\r\n\r\nI think that the mechanism mentioned in the OP (race after getting disconnected) is probably what makes this most noticeable, because `ThreadOpenAddedConnections()` has a long sleep (60s) which it wouldn't interrupt, and even though `EXTRA_NETWORK_PEER_INTERVAL = 5min` is larger, it would immediately kick in after the only peer from a network disconnected us (and then the next time ~5 minutes later), so `ThreadOpenConnection` would usually be quicker than `ThreadOpenAddedConnections()`.\r\n\r\nA completely unrelated problem is that this problem exists because cjdns has so few peers <10? on mainnet, which is a shame considering how much engineering effort went into it, but I'm not sure what to do about that.",

As to what we can do to further cjdns adoption, when one-click I2P support was added to Raspiblitz and Umbrel in December 2022 after [this workshop and blog post](https://jonatack.github.io/articles/using-alternative-p2p-networks-with-bitcoin-core), the number of recent peers returned by -addrinfo for me went from a couple hundred to quickly more than a thousand, and now a couple thousand.  Cjdns being a friend-of-a-friend topology requires the additional step of finding a friend to connect to the network with, but we have a couple of stable ones in the hardcoded DNS seeds, and maybe I can encourage and work with the node-in-a-box packages to get support for it in (and do more related workshops).",

      "body": "(hit \"submit\" too early)\r\n\r\nnit, non-blocker: I do not think that this `< 24` cap is needed. What is the max number of added nodes expected?\r\n\r\nI think it is not worth doing that, but in theory, if this is to be optimized - then we can observe that `addr_port_str` begins with `addr_str`. For example `aaa:8333` and `aaa` and if we are checking if string `aaaa` is equal to either one, the way this is done now is that it would traverse the entire `aaaa` twice whereas it can be done with a single traverse. But please ignore this :)",
