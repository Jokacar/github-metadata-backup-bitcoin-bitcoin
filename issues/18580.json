    "body": "Since we currently use QT LTS releases for building Bitcoin Core we may run into a problem as LTS releases are [being dropped](https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-offering-changes-2020) from the open source part of the QT project.\r\n\r\nThere are also [reports](https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-community/2020q2/006098.html) that QT may end up entirely abandoning open source for all QT releases less than 12 months old.\r\n\r\nSince it appears in both of these cases they will not be providing security fixes in a timely manner we may want to start planning how best to deal with these unfortunate changes.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding the QT parts of Bitcoin Core have minimal attack surface due to how we use QT but I'm not entirely sure.",

          "body": "TLDR: Mention that the codebase is now compatible with C++17, and that the\r\nintention is to require C++17 starting with 0.22.0.\r\n\r\nFollowing some discussion with Cory/Carl, and in #16684, I think this is the next step in the C++17 migration.\r\n\r\nWhile #16684 mentions a gitian/Guix release with C++17, it's not yet clear how that would be done. Are we just going to pass `--enable-c++17` in gitian/Guix?. Are we changing our default in configure.ac? \r\n\r\nAccording to the [last comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16684#issuecomment-643778757) in #16684, we wouldn't be changing anything in depends:\r\n> No, everything (including depends) will stay at C++11. \r\n\r\nHowever I don't think we want to be mixing C++11 built dependencies, with a C++17 built bitcoind, if there is any potential for compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nInstead, I'd suggest we build the 0.21.0 release as C++11, and do a complete switch to C++17 for 0.22.0. Also, if we actually wanted to use C++17 in depends for 0.21.0, we couldn't without breaking C++11 compat (Qt). See below.\r\n\r\nHere is a potential timeline/TODOs for the migration:\r\n\r\nPotential Timeline\r\n* 17 / 6 / 2020 - Today\r\n* Some time prior to split-off:\r\n    * Confirm that compiling with C++17 works.\r\n    * Confirm that C++11 compatibility has not been broken.\r\n* 1 / 11 / 2020\r\n    * [0.21.0 split off happens](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18947).\r\n* 2 / 11 / 2020\r\n    * Merge an \"incompatible with C++11\" change into master.\r\n    * Switch configure to use C++17 mode by default.\r\n    * Update minimum compiler requirements. At least:\r\n        * Clang 5: https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx17\r\n        * GCC 7: https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17\r\n            * While GCC has some support from 5, it seems a more complete support landed in GCC 7. \r\n            * https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-7/changes.html#cxx\r\n    * Switch depends packages to use C++17 where applicable.\r\n    * Bump Qt from 5.9.x (no c++17 mode) to, likely, 5.15.x (LTS).\r\n    * Drop support for macOS < 10.14.x\r\n        * The c++ dylib shipped with macOS [doesn't support c++17, prior to macOS 10.14](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16684#issuecomment-643722538).\r\n        * Building Qt 5.12 or 5.15 in C++17 mode will also require a minimum macOS deployment target of 10.14. https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/283832.\r\n    * Begin merging PRs like #19183 and #19245.\r\n        * I've left some comments in #19183 if the macOS runtime issue interests anyone.\r\n* 3 / 12 / 2020\r\n    * 0.21.0 released.\r\n    * Built as C++11.\r\n    * Contains warning in release notes that compiling 0.22.0 will require C++17.\r\n* 3 / 6 / 2021\r\n    * 0.22.0 released.\r\n    * Full of C++17 code.\r\n\r\nOne thing worth noting, is that we cannot bump our Qt to a newer LTS for 0.21.0, without breaking C++11 compatibility. Qt 5.12 is not compilable in C++11 mode, as the project has started using C++14 features throughout at least the macOS portions of it's codebase, and seemingly \"forgotten\" that the release is meant to be C++11 compatible. \r\nUpstream bug here: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-77310.\r\n> Building Qt requires C+11, at a minimum, but in practice we use later features, usually under a feature define, or with a fallback of some kind. On platforms that support > C11, we've (apparently) not considered the fallback necessary, under the assumption C+14 is always available.",
