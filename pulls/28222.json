    "body": "Switch to using smart pointers to `CNode`s inside of `CConnman`.\r\n\r\nCurrently we are manually refcounting CNodes which is potentially error-prone and makes operations such as deleting them from multiple threads difficult without introducing new locks or other synchronisation operations (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27912).\r\n\r\nSwitch to using `std::shared_ptr` references to `CNode`s inside of `m_nodes` and `m_nodes_disconnected` to give us better memory safety today, and in the future allow `AttemptToEvictConnection` (and optionally other sites) to safely synchronously disconnect nodes when needed.\r\n\r\nOpening as draft for now as I want to both gauge feedback on the approach, and see which PRs this may conflict with (#27213?) before moving it forwards.\r\n\r\nCC @vasild ",

It is currently only accessible through the test-only `-bip324=` command-line option, which specifies IPs, host names, or subnets for which to use BIP324 connections.

          "title": "net: transport abstraction",
          "body": "This PR furthers the P2P message serialization/deserialization abstraction introduced in #16202 and #16562, in preparation for introducing the BIP324 v2 transport (making this part of #27634). However, nothing in this PR is BIP324-specific, and it contains a number of independently useful improvements.\r\n\r\nThe overall idea is to have a single object in every `CNode` (called `m_transport`) that is responsible for converting sent messages to wire bytes, and for converting received wire bytes back to messages, while having as little as possible knowledge about this conversion process in higher-level net code. To accomplish that, there is an abstract `Transport` class with (currently) a single `V1Transport` implementation.\r\n\r\nStructurally, the above is accomplished by:\r\n* Merging the `TransportDeserializer` and `TransportSerializer` classes into a single `Transport` class, which encompasses both the sending and receiving side. For `V1Transport` these two sides are entirely separate, but this assumption doesn't hold for the BIP324 transport where e.g. the sending encryption key depends on the DH key negotiation data received from the other side. Merging the two means a future `V2Transport` can handle all this interaction without callers needing to be aware.\r\n* Removing the assumption that each message is sent using a computed header followed by (unmodified) data bytes. To achieve that, the sending side of `Transport` mirrors what the receiver side does: callers can set a message to be sent, then ask what bytes must be sent out, and then allowing them to transition to the next message.\r\n* Adding internal locks to protect the sending and receiving state of the `V1Transport` implementation. I believe these aren't strictly needed (opinions welcome) as there is no real way to use `Transport` objects in a multi-threaded fashion without some form of external synchronization (e.g. \"get next bytes to send\" isn't meaningful to call from multiple threads at the same time without mechanism to control the order they'll actually get sent). Still, I feel it's cleaner to make the object responsible for its own consistency (as we definitely do not want the entire object to be under a single external GUARDED_BY, as that'd prevent simultaneous sending and receiving).\r\n* Moving the conversion of messages to bytes on the sending side from `PushMessage` to `SocketSendData`, which is needed to deal with the fact that a transport may not immediately be able to send messages.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a refactor, though some commits are. Among the semantic changes are:\r\n* Changing the send buffer pushback mechanism to trigger based on the memory usage of the buffer rather than the amount of bytes to be sent. This is both closer to the desired behavior, and makes the buffering independent from transport details (which is why it's included here).\r\n* When optimistic send is not applicable, the V1 message checksum calculation now runs in the net thread rather than the message handling thread. I believe that's generally an improvement, as the message handling thread is far more computationally bottlenecked already.\r\n* The checksum calculation now runs under the `CNode::cs_vSend` lock, which does mean no two checksum calculations for messages sent to the same node can run in parallel, even if running in separate threads. Despite that limitation, having the checksum for non-optimistic sends moved in the net thread is still an improvement, I believe.\r\n* Statistics for per-message-type sent bytes are now updated when the bytes are actually handed to the OS rather than in `PushMessage`. This is because the actual serialized sizes aren't known until they've gone through the transport object.\r\n\r\nA fuzz test of the entire `V1Transport` is included. More elaborate rationale for each of the changes can be found in the commit messages.",

          "body": "## Rationale\r\n\r\nCurrently, `addnode` has a couple of corner cases that allow it to either connect to the same peer more than once, hence wasting outbound connection slots, or add redundant information to `m_added_nodes`, hence making Bitcoin iterate through useless data on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n### Connecting to the same node more than once\r\n\r\nIn general, connecting to the same node more than once is something we should try to prevent. Currently, this is possible via `addnode` in two different ways:\r\n\r\n1. Calling `addnode` more than once in a short time period, using two equivalent but distinct addresses\r\n2. Calling `addnode add` using an IP, and `addnode onetry` after with an address that resolved to the same IP\r\n\r\nFor the former, the issue boils down to `CConnman::ThreadOpenAddedConnections` calling `CConnman::GetAddedNodeInfo` once, and iterating over the result to open connections (`CConman::OpenNetworkConnection`) on the same loop for all addresses.`CConnman::ConnectNode` only checks a single address, at random, when resolving from a hostname, and uses it to check whether we are already connected to it.\r\n\r\nAn example to test this would be calling:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"127.0.0.1:port\" add\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"localhost:port\" add\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd check how it allows us to perform both connections some times, and some times it fails.\r\n\r\nThe latter boils down to the same issue, but takes advantage of `onetry` bypassing the `CConnman::ThreadOpenAddedConnections` logic and calling `CConnman::OpenNetworkConnection` straightaway. A way to test this would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"127.0.0.1:port\" add\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"localhost:port\" onetry\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Adding the same peer with two different, yet equivalent, addresses\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of `addnode` is pretty naive when checking what data is added to `m_added_nodes`. Given the collection stores strings, the checks at `CConnman::AddNode()` basically check wether the exact provided string is already in the collection. If so, the data is rejected, otherwise, it is accepted. However, ips can be formatted in several ways that would bypass those checks. \r\n\r\nTwo examples would be `127.0.0.1` being equal to `127.1` and `[::1]` being equal to `[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]`. Adding any pair of these will be allowed by the rpc command, and both will be reported as connected by `getaddednodeinfo`, given they map to the same `CService`. \r\n\r\nThis is less severe than the previous issue, since even tough both nodes are reported as connected by `getaddednodeinfo`, there is only a single connection to them (as properly reported by `getpeerinfo`). However, this adds redundant data to `m_added_nodes`, which is undesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Parametrize `CConnman::GetAddedNodeInfo`\r\nFinally, this PR also parametrizes `CConnman::GetAddedNodeInfo` so it returns either all added nodes info, or only info about the nodes we are **not** connected to. This method is used both for `rpc`, in `getaddednodeinfo`, in which we are reporting all data to the user, so the former applies, and to check what nodes we are not connected to, in `CConnman::ThreadOpenAddedConnections`, in which we are currently returning more data than needed and then actively filtering using `CService.fConnected()`\r\n",

There, it has been observed that if both sides of a P2P connection have a significant amount of data to send, a stall can occur, where both try to drain their own send queue before trying to receive. The same issue seems to apply to the current Bitcoin Core codebase, though I don't know whether it's a frequent issue for us.\r\n\r\nThe core issue is that whenever our optimistic send fails to fully send a message, we do subsequently not even select() for receiving; if it then turns out that sending is not possible either, no progress is made at all. To address this, the solution used in this PR is to still select() for both sending and receiving when an optimistic send fails, but skip receiving if sending succeeded, and (still) doesn't fully drain the send queue.\r\n\r\nThis is a significant reduction in how aggressive the \"receive pushback\" mechanism is, because now it will only mildly push back while sending progress is made; if the other side stops receiving entirely, the pushback disappears. I don't think that's a serious problem though:\r\n* We still have a pushback mechanism at the application buffer level (when the application receive buffer overflows, receiving is paused until messages in the buffer get processed; waiting on our own net_processing thread, not on the remote party).\r\n* There are cases where the existing mechanism is too aggressive; e.g. when the send queue is non-empty, but tiny, and can be sent with a single send() call. In that case, I think we'd prefer to still receive within the same processing loop of the network thread.\r\n",

This has the end result that new connections will only be accepted _after_ an existing connection is dropped, otherwise the new connection is dropped.\r\n\r\nPreviously the number of connected nodes could overflow `nMaxInbound` as (multiple) new connections could be accepted from `ThreadI2PAccept` -- each marking an existing connection to drop (in the future) -- before `ThreadSocketHandler` looped through to `DisconnectNodes()` and took care of the disconnections.\r\n\r\nNode disconnection and deletion are broken out into individual functions which handle a single node so they can be called both from `DisconnectNodes()` and `AttemptToEvictConnection`. This will result in more un/locking operations to perform mass disconnections, but as this only really happens when the network becomes inactive it should not be a problem.",

Then we loop through all our current connections, removing protected peers from the evict-able list. If we end up protecting all our remaining connections, the randomly chosen peer is evicted.\r\n\r\n`forceinbound` implies `noban` permission.\r\n\r\nAll outbound and `noban` connections remain protected from eviction.",

          "body": "To improve privacy, relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for relaying sensitive data (our own transactions) with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local unbroadcast transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer and the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed\r\n\r\n* Relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers.\r\n\r\n* Hide those transactions from `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` requests, as if we don't have them.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, request the transaction with `GETDATA`, as if we didn't have it before.\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the unbroadcast list.\r\n\r\n* `INV` it to others as a result of the `TX` message we get, like what we do with transactions that are not ours.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new local transaction is received (from the wallet or RPC), the node will send it to 5 (`SENSITIVE_RELAY_NUM_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 5 more peers (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptInitialBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived sensitive relay connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers will blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [x] Disable if `-connect` is used or Tor and I2P are not reachable.\r\n* [x] Use I2P transient connections even if listening on I2P.\r\n* [x] Do something with the user-agent string (could reveal identity if it has been personalized) and make sure no identifying information in the `VERSION` message. Done: took the [suggestion below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#issuecomment-1517896418).\r\n* [x] Improve the condition when we consider the transaction seen by the network: right now a single INV from somebody suffices (this is still an improvement over `master` which is ok right after pushing the tx to a peer). We could wait for more than one INV, from peers that we have selected (outbound) and that are specifically not the ones we broadcasted to (via short-lived connection). Edit: One `INV` should be enough because after that we broadcast the transaction to everybody we are connected to (like if it is not ours).\r\n* [ ] Idea: start with one connection per transaction (not 5 as it is now), optimistically assuming it will be sufficient. (numbers are examples) After 1 minute, if still not received from the network, try 2 connections, after a few minutes try more. If still unsuccessful after 10 minutes, then fall back to the old mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to address:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450\r\n",

          "body": "This is joint work with mzumsande. \r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to diversify outbound connections with respect to reachable networks. The existing logic evaluates peers for connection based purely on the frequency of available addresses in `AddrMan`. This PR adds logic to automatically connect to alternate reachable networks and adds eviction logic that protects one existing connection to each network. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if `AddrMan` is populated primarily with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and only a handful of onion addresses, it is likely that we won't establish any automatic outbound connections to Tor, even if we're capable of doing so. For smaller networks like CJDNS, this is even more of an issue and often requires adding manual peers to ensure regularly being connected to the network.\r\n\r\nConnecting to multiple networks improves resistance to eclipse attacks for individual nodes. It also benefits the entire p2p network by increasing partition resistance and privacy in general. \r\n\r\nThe automatic connections to alternate networks is done defensively, by first filling all outbound slots with random addresses (as in the status quo) and then adding additional peers from reachable networks the node is currently not connected to. This approach ensures that outbound slots are not left unfilled while attempting to connect to a network that may be unavailable due to a technical issue or misconfiguration that bitcoind cannot detect.\r\n\r\nOnce an additional peer is added and we have one more outbound connection than we want, outbound eviction ensures that peers are protected if they are the only ones for their network.\r\n\r\nManual connections are also taken into account: If a user already establishes manual connections to a trusted peer from a network, there is no longer a need to make extra efforts to ensure we also have an automatic connection to it (although this may of course happen by random selection). \r\n",

This is not completely true for the inbound eviction logic as it exists as static functions in `net.{h.cpp}` for which tests already exist. However, the outbound eviction logic is not covered by any fuzz tests and is only testable by spinning up both a connman and peerman.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits out the eviction logic into its own component `EvictionManager`. In addition to isolating the eviction logic, we get rid of several layer violations (e.g. `CConnman::ForEachNode/ForNode` calls, `CNode::m_last_block_time`, etc.) between `net` and `net processing`.\r\n\r\nOne instance of the `EvictionManager` is created at start up and passed as a reference to the connection and peer managers. The connection and peer managers report all eviction relevant information to the eviction manager who ultimately suggests nodes to evict as the result of `EvictionManager::SelectInboundNodeToEvict` and `EvictionManager::SelectOutboundNodesToEvict`.",
