The goal is to initiate discussion and gather feedback on the proposed changes to see if there is sufficient support for an ACK before finalizing an implementation.\r\n\r\nThis PR initially proposes the addition of a new thread and server to enable Bitcoin Core to run as a Sv2 TP (Stratum V2 Template Provider). This approach is the most direct and naive approach in regards to integrating into the Bitcoin architecture. It builds on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23049 but no longer uses the Rust library and implements the server and message de/serialization in C++.\r\n\r\nThis PR branch has been used for testing with the [SRI (Stratum V2 Reference Implementation)](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum), but it has been limited to regtest and some tests on testnet. This branch is considered far from complete.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nStratum V2 is a proposed evolution of the stratum mining protocol, it has several benefits over its predecessor:\r\n\r\n- By default, it uses secure communication, which can protect against man-in-the-middle-attacks, e.g. [hashrate hijacking](https://braiins.com/blog/hashrate-robbery-stratum-v2-fixes-this-and-more)                                                           \r\n\r\n- It uses a binary protocol instead of JSON, optimizing data transfer between all parties\r\n\r\n- It allows miners/downstream connections to propose their own transaction sets to mining pools                                                                                                                                    \r\n\r\n- It can reduce occurrence of empty mined blocks\r\n\r\nLinks below for further reference:\r\n\r\n- Stratum V2 specification: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec\r\n- SRI (Stratum V2 Reference Implementation): https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum\r\n- Stratum V2 overview: https://stratumprotocol.org/\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \r\nThe motivation for this PR and potential future work is to allow Bitcoin Core to run as a Sv2 TP. This will enable downstream Sv2 connections to be able to connect and receive/submit valid work over the Sv2 protocol.\r\n\r\nBelow is an outline of a few pros/cons regarding the Sv2 TP  in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n- Running Bitcoin Core with a config flag to enable the Sv2 TP could be arguably easier for adoption. A user would only need to be able to compile and run Bitcoin Core and its dependencies to be able to extract valid work and broadcast legitimate work over the Sv2 protocol\r\n\r\n- The Sv2 TP being as close as possible to the mempool and p2p network benefits downstream connections so that they can start new work quickly. The time between a node learning of a  new best block and then sending new work downstream should be as minimal as possible\r\n\r\n- Implementing the Sv2 TP in C++ means it should be (hopefully) easier for a wider range of contributors/reviewers to be able to maintain and build. The Sv2 TP only uses a small subset of messages from the entire Sv2 Rust library. Therefore, we realized that re-implementing a subset of the messages in C++ and implementing a server carries less external dependency risk and less architectural complexity\r\n\r\n- No additional external dependencies are required\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n- The Sv2 TP in core will need to be kept up to date with changes in the SRI, coordination would be required to prevent any potential versioning issues\r\n\r\n- Adds  another thread/sub-module that will need to access the mempool to build candidate blocks, so there would be another area of the code attempting to acquire `cs_main` via `BlockAssembler`\r\n\r\n- Another architectural approach other than a new thread and server for the Sv2 TP might be preferred such as the current work in the [multiprocess project](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Process-Separation)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\nTo run the Sv2 TP on this branch, Bitcoin needs to be configured with `./configure --enable-template-provider`.\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n\r\nIf there is sufficient approach/concept ACK or support in general. Then the below points are outstanding future work and existing nits.\r\n\r\nFuture work:\r\n\r\n- A noise implementation from the noise protocol framework needs to be introduced for secure communication between the Sv2 TP and downstream connections. The [noise spec for Sv2 has been reworked](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/04-Protocol-Security.md#43-choice-of-cryptographic-primitives) to accommodate resources currently available in core e.g. `secp256k1` and `BIP 340 schnorrsig`\r\n\r\n- There are current working changes proposed to the Sv2 TP spec, to allow downstream connections to send shorttxid  sets, allowing miners/downstream connections to present their own tx sets \r\n\r\n- Perhaps the Sv2 TP should be adapted to current work in the Bitcoin Core architecture. The new thread has been helpful for testing against the current SRI stack, it seems like the server implementation can adapt easily to different architectural needs\r\n\r\nExisting/known nits:\r\n\r\n- The server implementation has no limit on the number of downstream connections, it needs to be added\r\n\r\n- There could be potential conflict with functional tests. The Sv2 TP responds to the best new block change by reaching into the mempool and building a new block for downstream. My guess is that it would be acceptable to disable the Sv2 TP when running functional tests that asserts mempool state and then enable the Sv2 TP when it needs to specifically run its functional tests\r\n\r\n- Getting the full merkle path is required in the [NewTemplate](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/07-Template-Distribution-Protocol.md#72-newtemplate-server---client) message. I noticed that this was previously possible with the old implementation that was moved to [merkle_test.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2026301405f83c925ca68db6a3cd5134ed619ca7/src/test/merkle_tests.cpp#L114) , the current implementation does an in-place calculation to just return the root.  I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions or insight to a preferred solution? e.g. Move back  the old functions from merkle_tests or write a new implementation?\r\n \r\nThank you to all who helped contribute to the process of building this branch including working on the SRI, using this branch for testing and refining the Sv2 specs.\r\n\r\nAny feedback or reviews from nits to overall approach would be very much appreciated.\r\n",

      "body": "What are the reasons for not having this as a separate piece of software that calls the Bitcoin Core RPCs? From glancing at the code here it seems like `getblocktemplate` and `submitblock` would be the only needed RPCs. I've seen the discussion about separation (multi-process) in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23049 but wasn't convinced by the arguments there (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23049#issuecomment-926009122). I am worried about the maintenance burden of this and would prefer it being a separate thing.\r\n\r\nIf stratumv3 or \"some other cool new mining protocol\" comes out tomorrow, are we gonna add support for that too? In my opinion, Bitcoin Core's interfaces should accommodate projects like this but direct integration should be reserved for strictly necessary things.",

I can't think of anything that would not work by using the current interfaces or exposing extra functionality through them. For example, looking at Matt's comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23049#issuecomment-926009122:\r\n\r\n> do things like pre-construct next-next-block templates in advance and push them out quicker\r\n\r\nThis is not something we currently support and would (afaik) require significant changes to our mining/mempool logic (entirely separate of any stratum v2 changes). Once we have that functionality we should expose it through our interfaces (e.g. zmq, rpc, rest) such that applications like stratum v2 can make use of it.\r\n\r\n> the inefficiencies of getblocktemplate have been a real source of pain for pool operators for some time, I'm excited its going away.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but the inefficiencies of `getblocktemplate` (for the most part) stem from the underlying mining algorithm's runtime complexity. This is not something that stratum v2 magically solves.",

      "body": "I'm Concept ACK on eventually replacing the current `getblocktemplate` with another interface, for the following reasons:\r\n* The poll-based nature introduces unnecessary latency over a hypothetical push-based one.\r\n* Being RPC based, `getblocktemplate` is bandwidth and CPU inefficient due to JSON and hex encoding (for large amounts of data being transferred on every call).\r\n* `getblocktemplate` provides too much information for clients that do not care about performing their own transaction selection (full transaction hex and dependency information), with no way to opt out.\r\n\r\nNone of these deficiencies require the full StratumV2 approach to address; e.g. longpolling RPC could partially address the polling concern, a binary REST or ZMQ interface instead of RPC could address encoding issues, and additional RPC options to reduce verbosity could address that concern. Still, I don't think there was much impetus to improve upon these in an ecosystem that is `getblocktemplate`-based.\r\n\r\nIf (and that is an if) it is clear that the ecosystem is likely to adopt StratumV2, then I believe it makes sense to consider it as an interface too now. An alternative could still be a more \"neutral\" interface that is also push-based, binary, and efficient, and keep the StratumV2 logic as a separate daemon. That has advantages and disadvantages:\r\n\r\n* Advantages:\r\n  * Less complexity in Bitcoin Core to review and maintain.\r\n  * Less tied to the specific protocol, so wouldn't need Bitcoin Core changes when further protocol changes occur (as long as those don't introduce additional data requirements not exposed by the interface), perhaps making it easier to evolve StratumV2 (and/or successors).\r\n* Disadvantages:\r\n  * Slight efficiency/latency loss due to needing an additional process/layer to do the translation.\r\n  * Additional deployment friction (I do think it's important in general to make sure mining is as easy and efficient as possible, and having easily usable interfaces helps with that).\r\n  * In case a feature like outsourcing transaction selection is considered, I can imagine having one party performing the coinbase construction (the pool), and another performing transaction selection (the bitcoind talked to). In case this involves communicating e.g. the size/sigops of that coinbase to bitcoind for block construction, that may be harder to incorporate in a \"neutral\" protocol (it'd necessarily be bidirectional, while REST/ZMQ are inherently uni-directional I believe).\r\n\r\nI haven't reviewed StratumV2 itself, so I'm curious how people see these. Perhaps one can also consider different trade-offs in between \"`bitcoind` speaks the mining protocol directly\" and \"`bitcoind` only speaks a neutral interface\":\r\n* I assume what is considered in this PR is already only a subset of StratumV2 (as I remember there are multiple subprotocols, and I imagine not all of them are relevant to Bitcoin Core). But seeing things like Noise being part of the protocol, I do wonder if it's a possibility to just consider an unencrypted/unauthenticated subset, requiring a (perhaps much thinner) separate daemon to add that. Doing so may perhaps reduce the complexity to maintain in Bitcoin Core significantly.\r\n* Perhaps we see what is considered here as StratumV2 not so much as \"the\" mining protocol we expect everything to use, but just as the de facto binary interface protocol chosen because we need one anyway, and StratumV2 is already designed to cover the needs of such a protocol. If StratumV2 expansions/evolutions come along, or whatever other protocol, it may not be unreasonable to expect that to need a separate daemon that speaks StratumV2 with Bitcoin Core still.\r\n\r\n> This is not something we currently support and would (afaik) require significant changes to our mining/mempool logic (entirely separate of any stratum v2 changes). Once we have that functionality we should expose it through our interfaces (e.g. zmq, rpc, rest) such that applications like stratum v2 can make use of it.\r\n\r\nIt's true that we don't current support this, and that Stratum V2 does not magically solve this, but I do believe that part of the reason we don't is exactly because it's not that trivial in an RPC-based setting, and hard to move away from that in an ecosystem that's reliant on `getblocktemplate`. And in the long term, I do believe it's reasonable to consider at least the possibility of doing block template construction asynchronously in Bitcoin Core, because it is the one piece of infrastructure that has all the information to do so, and moving to such an approach enables for more computationally heavy block building without burdening the critical path.",

      "body": "> None of these deficiencies require the full StratumV2 approach to address;\n\nThis protocol basically is a protocol designed exactly for this use-case. The fact that it comes under a \"StratumV2\" banner is somewhat unrelated, there's only some common framing. It's also not a substantial protocol, arguably simpler than getblocktemplate in full.\n\nThis protocol exists basically to create an alternative to getblocktemplate which solves key problems in it, and can be used with or without any other Stratumv2 content.\n\n* it is (much, much) lower bandwidth than getblocktemplate,\n* it explicitly moves decisions of when to switch to a new block to bitcoin core with a push model, rather than long polling which almost never gets used in practice. This allows for substantially better optimization of transaction selection and next-block switching across the ecosystem. This also implies we cannot build this das some kind of layer on the existing bitcoin core APIs, there needs to be something new.\n* it provides some cryptographic authentication, allowing the protocol to go over the open internet without fear - this allows the protocol to take the place of current systems like CK's \"solopool\", which allows miners to solo mine without the complexity of running a full node and pool stack, and can now be replicated by any full node. More generally, abstracting the block construction logic from a pool via a protocol which doesn't require tight integration could allow pools or miners with regulatory risk to use a third party template provider.\n\nThis protocol is certainly not set in stone, if someone has ideas for other goals that should be addressed or other protocol tweaks that can still happen at this phase, though ideally not a complete rewrite :).",

      "body": "> What are the reasons for not having this as a separate piece of software that calls the Bitcoin Core RPCs? From glancing at the code here it seems like `getblocktemplate` and `submitblock` would be the only needed RPCs. I've seen the discussion about separation (multi-process) in #23049 but wasn't convinced by the arguments there (e.g. [#23049 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23049#issuecomment-926009122)). I am worried about the maintenance burden of this and would prefer it being a separate thing.\r\n> \r\n> If stratumv3 or \"some other cool new mining protocol\" comes out tomorrow, are we gonna add support for that too? In my opinion, Bitcoin Core's interfaces should accommodate projects like this but direct integration should be reserved for strictly necessary things.\r\n\r\nThanks and appreciate the time for reviewing the PR. A lot of the points are valid especially concerns around maintenance burden and supporting numerous project integrations.\r\n\r\nIn terms of RPC calls, this is of course possible. With stratum v2 some of the goals are around improving performance and reducing latency. JSON RPC can fall short in speed and efficiency. If the sv2 TP were to be run as a separate   process that uses the existing RPC calls, then at a very high level we have the overhead:\r\n\r\n- Encoding Template fields to bytes\r\n- Encode bytes to HexStr\r\n- Build a JSON representation with HexStr fields\r\n- Serialize JSON representation to utf8 binary and send over the wire\r\n\r\nwhere as if sv2 provided templates:\r\n\r\n- Encode Template fields to bytes (sv2 encoding)\r\n- Send sv2 bytes over the wire\r\n\r\nThere are different approaches we could take, none of which I think has necessarily strong support for a particular direction but I guess the common goal would be, to be able to extract templates and submit work more efficiently with less overhead than the current RPCs available",

JSON RPC can fall short in speed and efficiency.\r\n\r\nIts not just latency and overhead, however - one of the important goals of replacing GBT in Bitcoin Core broadly is to move towards everything being push, rather than polling. In general, block templates should come out of Bitcoin Core very aggressively - when a new block comes in and has been validated, before the mempool gets updated, we should be able to get a new block template out based on some prediction and conflict-removal, from there, we can update the mempool and then do a full new block generation, updating the template again. During steady-state, we should make decisions about when to update the block template based on new transactions (ignore 30-second-old transactions unless they have lots of fees, do a block template update immediately if a huge-fee transaction comes in, etc). This is important for long-term sustainability of Bitcoin Core as a block template constructor, and while GBT technically supports polling, I don't think any major production pool servers actually use it - it being optional means you can't make decisions like most of the above without assuming everyone uses GBT long-polling, which just isn't true.",

After studying more Stratum V2 and the inner details of mining operations, and in light of more “reactive\" block template construction in future in function of the processed mempool content, I think this more valuable to have Stratum V2 TP integrated in Bitcoin Core to enhance decentralization of the mining ecosystem. From a maintenance viewpoint, the changes are very “peripheral” from other subsystem like the validation engine or the p2p stack so concept ACK to have Stratum V2 TP in Core.\r\n\r\n> Another architectural approach other than a new thread and server for the Sv2 TP might be preferred such as the current work in the [multiprocess project](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Process-Separation)\r\n\r\nIn the future, it might make sense to split the `bitcoin-node` process in a bunch of more granualr process (e.g `bitcoin-validation`, `bitcoin-server` with indexes, `bitcoin-p2p`) to avoid exposed DoS leakage between them or having redundance of some functionality like block-relay. What can be a good architecture/deployment fit for a “hobbyist” full-node might not work for a substantial mining pool or Lightning Service Provider.",

This can of course point to existing documentation. [Config D](https://stratumprotocol.org/getting-started/#config-d-sv1-firmware--translation-proxy-jn-job-negotiator--sv2-pool) is close but it assumes regtest and running your own pool.\r\n\r\nFor this, honestly I'm not sure which would be the best configuration, I'll need to ask a few people that have done mainnet testing/testing with devices. I'll update the PR description once I find out.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> It will also be easier to test and review this pull request if you add some functional tests.

I implemented this change removing the compile configuration flag and just used `-stratumv2` and `stratumv2port` with some default ports for each env. \r\n\r\nI think since there's a lot of changes in this one PR and noise to come, it would probably make sense to break this down into much smaller focused PRs?
