Luckily, #9014 makes this a bit eaiser to fix - dont keep more than a few blocks around in shared_ptrs, just re-read them from disk after the reorg is complete when you need to call signalers. This may be complicated due to pruning, but it should be doable.\n",

By switching to using shared_ptrs for blocks in several places we not only fix the performance regression but open up the possibility of switching GetMainSignals() callbacks to background threads much more easily.\n",

          "body": "In the block connection logic we were tracking a vector of transactions found via the mempool that are now conflicted by transactions newly in blocks.  This allowed us to potentially find transactions that couldn't be found through only the wallets own conflict detection.  However we were not doing anything useful with this information, essentially only marking the cached credits/debits of the inputs dirty.  This wouldn't change balance calculations though as we weren't marking txs detected this way as conflicted in the wallet.  \r\n\r\nIn the future we might try to improve the best efforts detection of conflicted txs to use the mempool, but we can always resurrect this code if we find it useful.  In the meantime it serves as a confusion since it has no practical effect.   Getting conflict tracking correct is very difficult as transactions needed to make the connection may no longer be in the mempool and it's also important to be able to re-find any txs marked as conflicted if they become unconflicted.\r\n\r\nSee #8692  for more context.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the wallet still marks as conflicted txs it can find (anything linked only through wallet txs) and that the mempool still removes all conflicts (and dependents in the mempool).\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "This was partially addressed in #9208. However, the issue of keeping around all blocks connected in the ConnectTrace still exists. Note that, of course, this does not present an issue during normal connect since a ConnectTrace should only ever contain one block (as ABCS will return if it made progress).\r\n\r\n#10286 will present yet another issue here. Because wallet callbacks will not force the ABC thread to pause, callbacks could pile up and even if blocks get freed from the ConnectTrace, they could still sit around in memory waiting for the callback to finish. Luckily since wallet also takes cs_main there is some ability to block the main thread from making progress, assuming locks will switch between threads and not always get taken on the same thread if there is contention, but hopefully eventually wallet can lose much of its cs_main-taking, which means wallet needs a way to pause validation if it is super, super huge and gets far behind.",

          "body": "In `validation.cpp`, both `ConnectTip` and `DisconnectTip` invoke a `GetMainSignals()...` callback, which schedules a future event though the CScheduler interface.\r\n\r\nThese functions are called in 3 places:\r\n- `ActivateBestChainTipStep`\r\n- `InvalidateBlock`\r\n- `RewindBlockIndex`\r\n\r\nThe first of these 3 prevents the scheduler queue from growing unboundedly, by limiting the size to 10 in `ActivateBestChainTip`. The other two however do not, and @Sjors discovered that doing a giant `invalidateblock` RPC call will in fact blow up the node's memory usage (which turns out to be caused by the queue events holding all disconnected blocks in memory).\r\n\r\nI believe there are several improvements necessary.\r\n\r\n1. (short term symptom fix) If this issue also appears for `RewindBlockIndex`, we must fix it before 0.17, as this may prevent nodes from upgrading pre-0.13 code. I think this is easy, as this function is called prior to normal node operation, so it can easily be reworked to release `cs_main` intermittently and drain the queue.\r\n\r\n2. (long term fix) The use of background queues is a means to increase parallellism, not a way to break lock dependencies (as @gmaxwell pointed out privately to me, whenever a background queue is used to break a dependency, attempts to limit its size can turn into a deadlock). One way I think is to have a debug mode where the background scheduler immediately runs all scheduled actions synchronously, forcing all add-to-queue calls to happen without locks held. Once everything works in such a mode, we can safely add actual queue size limits as opposed to ad-hoc checks to prevent the queue from growing too large.\r\n\r\n3. (orthogonal memory usage reduction) It's unfortunate that our `DisconnectBlock` events hold a shared pointer to the block being disconnected. Ideally there is a shared layer that only keeps the last few blocks in memory, and releases and reloads them from disk when needed otherwise. This wouldn't fix the unbounded growth issue above, but it would reduce the impact. It's also independently useful to reduce the memory during very large reorgs (where we can't run callbacks until the entire thing completed).\r\n",
