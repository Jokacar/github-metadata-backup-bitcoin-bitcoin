After re-indexing and working fine for hours at time (much better than 0.8.1 at least) upon restart I get \"Error opening block database. Do you want to rebuild the block database?\" which of course I don't want to do because it takes forever, even on this world's fastest Mac with SSD drive.  This has happened 6 times now, and the interesting line in debug.log is:\n\nVerifying last 288 blocks at level 3\nLevelDB read failure: Corruption: block checksum mismatch\n\nMore details here:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155140.0\n\nDowngrading to 0.7.2 again, please help permanently fix this in the next 0.8.x release.\n",
