    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nWhen a function requires a `const char *end`, one might assume that the string doesn't need to be null terminated. `getJsonToken` requires this parameter:\r\n```\r\nenum jtokentype getJsonToken(std::string& tokenVal, unsigned int& consumed,\r\n                            const char *raw, const char *end)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the function does assume that the underlying memory block is null-terminated as is visible here:\r\n```\r\n        if (!strncmp(raw, \"null\", 4)) {\r\n            //...\r\n        } else if (!strncmp(raw, \"true\", 4)) {\r\n            //...\r\n        } else if (!strncmp(raw, \"false\", 5)) {\r\n            //...\r\n```\r\nand here:\r\n```\r\nif ((*firstDigit == '0') && json_isdigit(firstDigit[1]))\r\n```\r\nand possibly others.\r\n\r\nIf the string isn't null terminated, then we run risk of reading uninitialized memory, which could lead to a crash.\r\n\r\nIn practice this currently does not seem to lead to any issues, as all usages that I could find used underlying null-terminated blocks. It is however an uncomfortable pitfall for future development.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe function should either make sure to never access anything beyond or at the end pointer, or should document this requirement properly.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```\r\nchar innocentChar = 'n';\r\ngetJsonToken(/*...*/, &innocentChar, (&innocentChar) + 1);\r\n```\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nOther\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nmaster@3654d84\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nCommon code issue, os irrelevant\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
