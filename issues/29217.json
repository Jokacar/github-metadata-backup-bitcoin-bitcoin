Instead I threaded through the max fee argument and used that directly via ATMPArgs. From that perspective, this is somewhat a reversion from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19339. In a post-cluster mempool world, these checks could be consolidated to right after the given (ancestor) package is linearized/chunked, by just checking the feerate of the top chunk and rejecting the submission entirely if the top chunk is too high.\r\n\r\nThe implication here is that subpackages can be submitted to the mempool prior to hitting this new fee-based error condition.",
