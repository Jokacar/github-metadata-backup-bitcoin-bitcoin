    "body": "Replace `LogPrint*` functions with severity based logging functions:\r\n\r\n * `LogInfo(...)`, `LogWarning(...)`, `LogError(...)` for unconditional (uncategorised) logging (replaces `LogPrintf`)\r\n * `LogDebug(CATEGORY, ...)` and `LogTrace(CATEGORY, ...)` for conditional logging (replaces `LogPrint`)\r\n * `LogPrintLevel(CATEGORY, LEVEL, ...)` for when the level isn't known in advance, or a category needs to be added for an info/warning/error log message (mostly unchanged, but rarely needed)\r\n\r\nLogs look roughly as they do now with `LogInfo` not having an `[info]` prefix, and `LogDebug` having a `[cat]` prefix, rather than a `[cat:debug]` prefix. This removes `BCLog::Level::None` entirely -- for `LogFlags::NONE` just use `Level::Info`, for any actual category, use `Level::Debug`.\r\n\r\nAdds docs to developer-notes about when to use which level.\r\n\r\nAdds `-loglevelalways=1` option so that you get `[net:debug]`, `[all:info]`, `[all:warning]` etc, which might be helpful for automated parsing, or just if you like everything to be consistent. Defaults to off to reduce noise in the default config, and to avoid unnecessary changes on upgrades.\r\n\r\nChanges the behaviour of `LogPrintLevel(CATEGORY, BCLog::Level::Info, ...)` to be logged unconditionally, rather than only being an additional optional logging level in addition to trace and debug. Does not change the behaviour of `LogPrintLevel(NONE, Debug, ...)` and `LogPrintLevel(NONE, Trace, ...)` being no-ops.",

Note that this effectively reverts #25306.\r\n\r\nIt should be compatible with other in-progress PRs -- it only deprecates the `LogPrint*` functions, it doesn't break them. And it should be easy to finish the conversion with a scripted-diff replacing LogPrintf/LogPrint across the codebase.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a straightforward way of getting the logging stuff finished up.\r\n\r\ncc @jonatack ",

          "body": "Fixes #27744\r\n\r\nSince #27278 we log received headers. For compact blocks we also log which peer sent it (e5ce8576349d404c466b2f4cab1ca7bf920904b2), but not for regular headers. That required an additional refactor, which this PR provides.\r\n\r\nMove the logging from validation to net_processing.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces the number of log entries (under default configuration) per compact block header from 3 to 2: one for the header and one for the connected tip.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces a new helper method `LogBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a _compact block_ we call `LogBlockHeader` from the exact same place as where we previously logged. So that log message doesn't change. What does change is that we no longer _also_ log from `AcceptBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a regular header(s) message, _we only log the last one_. This is a change in behaviour because it was simpler to implement, but it's probably better anyway. It does mean that if a peer sends of a bunch of headers of which _any_ is invalid, we won't log it (here).\r\n\r\nLastly I expanded the code comment explaining why we log this. It initially only covered selfish mining, but we also care about peers sending us headers but not following up (see e.g. #27626).\r\n\r\nExample log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:21Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:23Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223098 tx=848176824 date='2023-06-05T13:11:49Z' progress=1.000000 cache=6.4MiB(54615txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z Saw new cmpctblock header hash=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223112 tx=848179461 date='2023-06-05T13:13:58Z' progress=1.000000 cache=7.2MiB(61275txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:41Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 peer=8\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:42Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 version=0x2db3c000 log2_work=94.223126 tx=848182944 date='2023-06-05T13:14:35Z' progress=1.000000 cache=8.0MiB(69837txo)\r\n```",

          "body": "The logging RPC does not work as intended and as documented in its help when `0` or `none` are passed.\r\n\r\nPer the RPC logging help:\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli help logging\r\n\r\nIn addition, the following are available as category names with special meanings:\r\n  - \"all\",  \"1\" : represent all logging categories.\r\n  - \"none\", \"0\" : even if other logging categories are specified, ignore all of them.\r\n```\r\n    \r\nThe behavior and documentation were added in #11191, but over time and extended refactoring, the behavior no longer works in master and versions 22/23/24 (the last supported versions currently) -- passing `0`/`none` has no effect.  As there was no test coverage, the regressions went uncaught.  In v24, `none` became unrecognized:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli logging '[\"none\"]'\r\nerror code: -8\r\nerror message:\r\nunknown logging category none\r\n```\r\n    \r\nDuring the same time period, passing `1` and `all` has been operational and documented. \r\n\r\nSolution: detect `none`/`0` values and add test coverage in any case, and either:\r\n    \r\n- leave the functionality out, raise with an error message if the values are passed, and update the RPC help documentation, or\r\n\r\n- fix the behavior by returning early.\r\n\r\nBoth solutions involve essentially the same code size and complexity.  Given that `all`/`1` has been operational, and that `none`/`0` has been documented and appears per the code of the original PR to have been operational, it seems preferable for consistency to support `none`/`0` in symmetry with `all`/`1` and as ACKed, intended, and documented in #11191.\r\n\r\nDone by this pull:    \r\n- add missing RPC logging logic and test coverage\r\n- update the `-debug` and `-debugexclude` config options to use the same code for consistency in behavior between them, and for consistency with the logging RPC that provides the same behavior for both `-include` and `-exclude`\r\n- improve the user-facing documentation and examples; can be tested with `./src/bitcoind -h | grep -A12 \"\\-debug=<\\|debugexclude\" && ./src/bitcoin-cli help logging`\r\n\r\nIf it is decided to backport a fix, commit `Fix RPC logging behavior when \"0\" and \"none\" values are passed` could probably suffice.",

          "body": "When running with `-debug=validation` the log is filled with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-03-19T12:46:01Z [validation] Enqueuing TransactionAddedToMempool: txid=37c8e1ef87d75a67fbaf44e116018fbc70d9c4ef0e27e2ae56861395101f9b8e wtxid=24e2d76012f9cde451d085ead4feab136feddae6cb55d37221a81aac6c0eaf42\r\n2023-03-19T12:46:01Z [validation] TransactionAddedToMempool: txid=37c8e1ef87d75a67fbaf44e116018fbc70d9c4ef0e27e2ae56861395101f9b8e wtxid=24e2d76012f9cde451d085ead4feab136feddae6cb55d37221a81aac6c0eaf42\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese log entries are more appropriate for `-debug=mempool`.\r\n\r\nThis change limits `-debug=validation` to messages that are related to blocks and headers. It also downgrades `Enqueuing` messages to the `Trace` level.\r\n\r\nIt makes it easier to run for a long time without excessive log file growth. This debug category is particularly useful for keeping track of problematic headers that were seen, the timing of reorgs, see also #27276.\r\n\r\nSince this PR touches `validationinterface.cpp` anyway, it also includes a commit to drop function names from log messages, since we now have `-logsourcelocations`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, though less important, I moved `[validation] Pre-allocating up to position 0x… in rev….dat` messages to blockstorage. This reduces the number of `[validation]` log messages further. ~to 3 per (normal) block.~\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volume of log messages [could also have been reduced](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27277#discussion_r1141375638) by changing the log level of these messages to `trace`. Doing so would prevent a whack-a-mole game of moving log messages to different categories. However in this case I think the change in log category would be justified even if it didn't have a big impact on noise. I.e. someone running with `-debug=mempool` would expect to see the `TransactionAddedToMempool` messages and someone running with `-debug=blockstorage` would perhaps be surprised to not see the `Pre-allocating` message.",

          "body": "Add `util::Result` support for returning more error information and make use of it in [LoadChainstate method](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665/commits/0b099d463ac0644be3c7646708ded0d4a67eecae) as an initial application. Followup PR [#25722](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25722) uses it more broadly to return errors and warnings from wallet loading functions as well.\r\n\r\nThis change adds two major features to the result class:\r\n\r\n- For better error handling, adds the ability to return a value on failure, not just a value on success. This is a key missing feature that makes the result class not useful for functions like `LoadChainstate()` which produce different errors that need to be handled differently [^1].\r\n\r\n[^1]: Ability to return error values was actually present in the original implementation of [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218), but unfortunately removed in later iterations.\r\n\r\n- For better error reporting, adds the ability to return warning messages and multiple errors, not just a single error string. This provides a way for functions to report errors and warnings in a standard way, and simplifies interfaces:\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -virtual std::unique_ptr<Wallet> loadWallet(const std::string& name, bilingual_str& error, std::vector<bilingual_str>& warnings) = 0;\r\n    +virtual util::Result<std::unique_ptr<Wallet>> loadWallet(const std::string& name) = 0;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options, DatabaseStatus& status, bilingual_str& error);\r\n    +util::Result<std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase>, DatabaseError> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options);\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThis change also makes some more minor improvements:\r\n\r\n- Smaller type size. `util::Result<int>` is 16 bytes, and `util::Result<void>` is 8 bytes. Previously both were 72 bytes.\r\n\r\n- Broader type compatibility. Supports noncopyable and nonmovable success and error types.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives & design notes\r\n\r\nThe main goal for the `util::Result` class is to provide a standard way for functions to report error and warnings strings. The interface tries to make it easy to provide detailed error feedback to end users, without cluttering code or making it harder to return other result information. There have been multiple iterations of the design using different internal representations and providing different capabilities:\r\n\r\n|   | Representation (approximate)                   | Notes |\r\n|---|------------------------------------------------|-------|\r\n| _(1)_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Original #25218 implementation in da98fd2efc1a6b9c6e876cf3e227a8c2e9a10827. Good capabilities, but larger type size. Supports error standardized error reporting and customized error handling with failure values. |\r\n| _(2)_ | `variant<T,bilingual_str>`                | Final #25218 implementation in 7a45c33d1f8a758850cf8e7bd6ad508939ba5c0d. No support for returning failure values so not useful in many cases.\r\n| _(3)_ | `variant<monostate,T,F>`                 | Pending #25601 implementation that allows choosing whether to use standardized error reporting or return custom failure values, but doesn't support having both at the same time, like approaches _(1)_, _(4)_, _(5)_, _(6)_ do. |\r\n | _(4)_ | `tuple<variant<T,F>,bilingual_str>`      | Original #25608 implementation in c29d3008de9314dd463ed08e8bff39fe55324498. Basically the same as _(1)_ except it uses separate success and failure types instead of the same type. Using separate success and failure types makes the result class a little less flexible but can help avoid some ambiguity and inconsistent result states. |\r\n| _(5)_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Final #25608 implementation in dd91f294206ac87b213d23bb76656a0a5f0f4781. Essentially the same as original implementation _(1)_ except has some usability improvements. |\r\n| _(6)_ | `tuple<T,unique_ptr<tuple<F,bilingual_str>>` | Pending #25665 implementation (this PR). Supports returning failure values, uses separate success and failure types to avoid ambiguity, uses `unique_ptr` to reduce result type size, and avoids heap allocation in the happy path. |\r\n\r\n### Prior discussions & history\r\n\r\n- _furszy_ introduced a `BResult` class providing a standard error reporting mechanism in [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218). It was renamed to `util::Result` in [#25721](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25721) but kept the same representation and capabilities.\r\n\r\n- _MarcoFalke_ suggested using `BResult` for the `LoadChainstate` function in [#25308 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25308#issuecomment-1181674645). Inability to use `BResult` there due to lack of support for failure values led to initial work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _w0xlt_ wrote a `StructuredResult` class in [#25308](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25601) adding the ability to return failure values but sacrificing standard error reporting, which led to more work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _martinus_ suggested a space optimization in [#25608 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608#discussion_r921049409) that also made it easier to support distinct failure & success types, leading to [#25665](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665) as a replacement for [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).",

But no reason it can't be reviewed now. It could also be split up to separate out the `-loglevel` vs `-trace` change, or to defer the `map` to `atomic` change -- ie, I guess if later commits don't feel worth the review effort, feel free to stop early?",

      "body": "> [068de7a](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/068de7abc5bda9fd9928d7145265ae3a3a851de0) The idea behind the severity level logging is to ultimately have only one macro like `Log(category, level)` with one consistent, simple interface for everyone -- both developers updating logging in the code and people who read the logs\r\n\r\nI think there's a higher level goal than that: logs should be convenient and easy for developers and users. Hopefully that's a boring platitude, so I'm going to assume you agree with that?\r\n\r\nIn particular, I don't think we should prioritise \"one function\" if it makes reading/writing code tedious and inconvenient, and to me, reading/writing `Log(BCLog::NET, BCLog::Level::Debug, ...)` (with or without the current `PrintLevel`) is pretty ugly. I think it's better to have multiple functions than the other ways I can think of removing the `BCLog::Level::` boilerplate. \r\n\r\nSecond, for both users and developers, I think the mix of enabled/disabled categories and global/category-specific levels is super confusing. AFAICS at the highest level we only really want three things:\r\n\r\n * unconditional logging for high-importance information\r\n * subsystem specific debug logging that can be turned on (in production) to get detailed information about what's going on\r\n * subsystem specific trace logging to get highly detailed logging that may have severe performance impacts to diagnose specific misbehaviours\r\n\r\n> [94e1b46](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/94e1b46776e68f26f530c23123e9cecdb661de8a) This would move the category from the prefix back into the log message string on an ad hoc basis, would be less consistent, and IMO a step backward.\r\n\r\nMy reasoning here is that the usefulness of the \"category\" isn't in telling us what bit of code triggered the log message (we have `-logsourcelocations` for that which is much more precise, and you can generally just grep for the message anyway), but in categorising log messages the user can disable. It's useful for the user to see `[net]` because it tells them they can use `-debug=net` to enable it; it's useful for the user to see `[net:trace]` because it tells them they also need to enable tracing to see that. It's useful to see `[warning]` or `[error]` because those are things they probably want to take action on, and having a consistent tag means they can grep for them more easily. It's not useful to see `[net:info]` because that doesn't tell them anything they can action, it's just noise that makes it harder to read the logs.\r\n\r\nSo I contend that approach is consistent, it's just consistent over a different (in my opinion more valuable) attribute; namely that categories are solely for conditional logging that the user can disable on a per-subsystem basis.\r\n\r\n> [f20bfc3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f20bfc3d95be659cbfa502151dd960c44d315988) Non-urgent approach ACK, I can pull it into the parent in #25203 if you like.\r\n\r\n(I don't think any of this is \"urgent\")\r\n\r\n> [b3bf2fa](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/b3bf2fafa678fbde303e7cccff70e3b2a6b66627) This would be a step back, I think, away from consistent explicit logging, to requiring remembering more implicit mental context baggage (\"why do I see categories for these logs and not for those?\") Also, the prefix allows not needing to put the category manually into the log strings.\r\n\r\nThat question is easy to answer: you see categories for log entries that you need to use config options to enable. Likewise in the code: you write `BCLog::HTTP` for `LogDebug` and `LogTrace` entries that will only be shown if the user specifically enables that log category, and you don't write it when that's not the case.\r\n\r\nCompare:\r\n\r\n1. `LogInfo(\"Starting HTTP server with %d worker threads\\n\", rpcThreads);`\r\n2. `LogPrintfCategory(BCLog::HTTP, \"Starting server with %d worker threads\\n\", rpcThreads);`\r\n3. `Log(BCLog::HTTP, BCLog::Level::Info, \"Starting server with %d worker threads\\n\", rpcThreads);`\r\n\r\nand the log messages:\r\n\r\n1. `Starting HTTP server with 2 worker threads`\r\n2. `[http] Starting server with 2 worker threads`\r\n3. `[http:info] Starting server with 2 worker threads`\r\n\r\nFor unconditional logging, just writing self-explanatory text is shorter and easier to understand.\r\n\r\nFor conditional logging, we have to tell the compiler the category, so the `BCLog::HTTP` part isn't really avoidable, but having  functions to cover the two levels of conditional logging at least eliminates the boiler plate.\r\n\r\n> [53a7f76](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/53a7f76feb8fee8a00bea245940e46d65892f692) Much of the value from severity level logging will come from making some of the noisy categories (`net` in particular, and maybe validation and mempool) much more useful by selecting which LogPrints become debug vs trace, and in general, by selecting which LogPrintfs become info, warning, or error.\r\n\r\nI think it would make sense for the line between info/warning/error to be:\r\n\r\n * normally, it's a category specific debug log. your log message probably just isn't that important.\r\n * otherwise, for important but rare messages (eg on startup), use info.\r\n * for something where the admin probably wants to take action, upgrade that to warning (eg things that trigger `SetMiscWarning`, like your system time being set wrong; or if you've enabled tor but tor connections aren't working)\r\n * use error for things severe enough that bitcoind will shutdown now (or perhaps just some subsystem, eg a particular wallet that's discovered its db is corrupt/unreadable/unwritable)\r\n\r\nThat seems pretty easy for both developers and users to keep consistent.\r\n\r\n(Actually, maybe it's worth distinguishing \"startup\" and \"recurring-info\" messages -- it's useful and okay for startup to be a bit noisy; but info messages should be very rare. Something like `LogInit(...)` for unconditional startup logging, and `LogImportant(...)` for UpdateTip and new outbounds.)\r\n\r\nThe \"if it's usable in production, then do it as `debug`, only use `trace` for stuff that's not usable in production\" rule I suggested above would imply that it'd be better to split `net` into multiple categories rather than move it into trace, I think. Concretely, the \"send: msg\" / \"recv: msg\" logging in particular could be its own category. `[net:trace]` would only be useful for extra logging that's not suitable for production, maybe like logging every w/txid that's in an INV message, rather than just the first?\r\n\r\n> [4906f49](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/4906f49f0932cc8f6244cff8cfbd79407031e7b2) is an incomplete version of [`118c756` (#25203)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25203/commits/118c7567f62df2b882877590f232242d7c627a05) in the parent pull.\r\n\r\nI mean, that PR had been closed for 7 months...

Another approach to consider might be replacing `-debug=all -debugexclude=libevent` with `-debug=all -debug=-libevent`, which would naturally generalise to the same syntax with `-trace`.\r\n\r\nI presume the logging RPC would just change to accept `[\"net\"] [\"validation\"] [\"wallet\"]` to set net's logging level to debug, validation's to disabled/info, and wallet's to debug+trace, and return `{\"net\": true, \"validation\": false, \"wallet\": \"trace\"}` or something.\r\n\r\n> [451f2e7](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/451f2e76b3293836509c1865222c23ef7b4aacf2) Concept ACK on avoiding a mutex. I have had the nagging thought for a long time that it may not be inconceivable for some users to prefer logging only errors and warnings, thus to avoid coding ourselves into a corner regarding `info` always being logged (which might apply to the preceding commit as well).\r\n\r\nI don't think that's a sensible concern: unconditional logging should be rare enough to not need disabling (eg, connecting to new outbounds, new headers, and new tips for about 400 entries a day), and at that point it's better not to disable them as that gives the user a pretty clear indication their node is still working right. Even for users that only care about errors/warnings, having the UpdateTip context at least is likely useful for giving some clue what state the node was in when it encountered the problem.",
