Are these bandwidth savings worth the added code complexity?</i>\r\n\r\nThe project has received Concept ACK from many contributors, and no NACKs. I am unlikely to invent a bulletproof argument, so I leave it up to each reviewer to compare the risks and review costs to the benefits.\r\n\r\nI personally think that the added code is pretty straightforward because it communicates with a legacy code through a thin interface (100 LOC in `net_processing.cpp` to collect transactions instead of relaying them immediately, although the reconciliation code is 500 LOC -- excluding comments and minisketch). Hence it is acceptable to pay for the given optimization.\r\n\r\nIf you suggest any experiment that will convince you, I will do my best to execute it.\r\n\r\n</details>",

They will become permanent topics in our weekly IRC meetings so that we can get updates on the progress of each project and determine the next step to move them forward.\r\n\r\nVoting will close at the start of the IRC meeting on October 19th at 14:00 UTC. To vote, please leave a comment containing the three projects from the list below that you would like to be the priority projects.

          "body": "Erlay Project Tracking: #28646\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation of  [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518) , using primitives in the BIP-330 (see the updated spec  [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki) ). Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670).\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I‚Äôll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n* save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n* increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n* improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\n### How to review\r\n\r\nI suggest doing `make clean && autogen.sh && configure` before you try building it locally.",
