    "body": "Part of #27463.\r\n\r\n(Transaction) **orphan resolution** is a process that kicks off when we are missing UTXOs to validate an unconfirmed transaction. We currently request missing parents by txid; BIP 331 also defines a way to [explicitly request ancestors](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0331.mediawiki#handle-orphans-better).\r\n\r\nCurrently, when we find that a transaction is an orphan, we only try to resolve it with the peer who provided the `tx`. If this doesn't work out (e.g. they send a `notfound` or don't respond), we do not try again. We actually can't, because we've already forgotten who else could resolve this orphan (i.e. all the other peers who announced the transaction).\r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with this? It makes transaction download less reliable, particularly for 1p1c packages which must go through orphan resolution in order to be downloaded.\r\n\r\nCan we fix this with BIP 331 / is this \"duct tape\" before the real solution?\r\nBIP 331 (receiver-initiated ancestor package relay) is also based on the idea that there is an orphan that needs resolution, but it's just a new way of communicating information. It's not inherently more honest; you can request ancestor package information and get a `notfound`. So ancestor package relay still requires some kind of procedure for retrying when an orphan resolution attempt fails. See the #27742 implementation which builds on this orphan resolution tracker to keep track of what packages to download (it just isn't rebased on this exact branch). The difference when using BIP 331 is that we request `ancpkginfo` and then `pkgtxns` instead of the parent txids.\r\n\r\nApproach\r\nThis PR introduces `m_orphan_resolution_tracker` which is responsible for remembering which peers are candidates for orphan resolution and scheduling when to make orphan resolution requests (i.e. getdata for txid of missing parent(s)). The scheduling process should be:\r\n- Bandwidth-efficient: don't have too many requests out at once. As already implemented today, transaction requests for orphan parents and regular download both go through the `TxRequestTracker` so that we don't have duplicate requests out.\r\n- Not vulnerable to censorship: don't give up too easily, use all candidate peers. See e.g. https://bitcoincore.org/en/2024/07/03/disclose_already_asked_for/\r\n- Load-balance between peers: don't overload peers; use all peers available. This is also useful for when we introduce per-peer orphan protection, since each peer will have limited slots.\r\n\r\nNotice that the functionality and requirements are extremely similar to that of transaction download. Naturally, `TxRequestTracker` is the data structure used for `m_orphan_resolution_tracker`. Instead of tracking hashes of transactions we need to download, it tracks hashes of orphans we need to resolve. ",

      "body": "Concept ACK\r\n\r\nI implemented what I was talking about in the [review club yesterday](https://bitcoincore.reviews/31397) here: https://github.com/dergoegge/bitcoin/commits/2024-12-rslv-orphns/ (the only difference is the main commit 3928b400d805f75e0ba5b9947d5d441a828aa5be) and it looks like it passes your functional test additions! So perhaps it's worth exploring if we actually need another tracker...\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>IRC logs</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n17:34 \t<dergoegge> I was wondering why we need another txrequest tracker instance for this? couldn’t we just keep track of announcers in the orphanage (same as in the PR) and then add requests for the parents to the existing tracker on future announcements?\r\n17:35 \t<glozow> dergoegge: that's an idea. How would you schedule the requests?\r\n17:35 \t<dergoegge> ideally at the same time\r\n17:35 \t<glozow> Is there a cost to having another txrequest tracker? It's not that different from adding another std::map\r\n17:35 \t<glozow> No, I mean, how would you load-balance between peers, bake in preferences, etc.\r\n17:36 \t<dergoegge> isn't that what the existing tracker does?\r\n17:36 \t<glozow> Oh, you mean adding a new type to the tracker? So we'd have txid type, wtxid type, and orphan?\r\n17:37 \t<glozow> also note that the parent requests are added to the txrequest tracker\r\n17:39 \t<dergoegge> I guess I'm wondering why we need the concept of tracking the resolution by orphan id, as opposed to just putting the requests for the parents in the existing tracker\r\n17:39 \t<glozow> we do put the requests for the parents in the existing tracker\r\n17:39 \t<glozow> Maybe we are crossing wires?\r\n17:39 \t<instagibbs> mmmm he's asking why the add to new tracker, then \"immediately\" add to old one, vs just add to old one, I think\r\n17:40 \t<dergoegge> yea\r\n17:40 \t<instagibbs> add to old one with \"proper delays\"\r\n17:40 \t<instagibbs> I didn't get far enough in my review to figure this out either 😅\r\n17:40 \t<glozow> We might have multiple candidates for orphan resolution\r\n17:41 \t<glozow> Oh I see what you're saying\r\n17:42 \t<dergoegge> \"multiple candidates\" as in same parents different orphan?\r\n17:42 \t<glozow> Perhaps that could work, where you're treating it as if all of them just announced the missing parents? I don't know how you'd add `ancpkginfo` orphan resolution easily this way though.\r\n17:43 \t<glozow> different peers same orphan\r\n17:43 \t<instagibbs> You'd also have to somehow track that you're no longer asking for any parents of an orphan in order to EraseOrphanOfPeer?\r\n17:43 \t<marcofleon> yeah i was thinking it made sense with GetCandidatePeers. Having another tracker to separate out the orphan reso process\r\n17:46 \t<glozow> will think about this idea some more\r\n17:47 \t<dergoegge> me too 👍\r\n17:47 \t<glozow> I think it's possible it works? My main questions would be (1) what is the cost of having a second tracker? Because it's the perfect data structure for this. (2) how do we make it extensible to package relay still.\r\n17:48 \t<instagibbs> imo the cost is mostly an additional structure lying around that needs to stay in sync with other things\r\n17:48 \t<dergoegge> 1) if we don't need it then it's just extra complexity 2) fair!\r\n17:48 \t<marcofleon> The fact that there are candidates that be added or not added to that new tracker is why it made sense to me in the first place I guess is what i was saying\r\n17:48 \t<marcofleon> can be*\r\n17:49 \t<glozow> (1) shoving it into the existing tracker but needing to have extra logic could also be complexity!\r\n17:49 \t<dergoegge> well in my mind it wouldn't need extra logic but I might be wrong, need to think more\r\n17:49 \t<instagibbs> proof of code for this I think..\r\n17:49 \t<glozow> but yeah, I don't like that we need to ensure m_orphanage and m_orphan_resolution_tracker are in sync. that's super fair\r\n17:49 \t<dergoegge> frfr\r\n17:50 \t<glozow> yeah let's see what the code would look like\r\n17:50 \t<marcofleon> fr\r\n17:50 \t<glozow> fr r r\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",
