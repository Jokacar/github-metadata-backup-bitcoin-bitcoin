    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to refactor the Bitcoin relay fee in a way that would benefit full nodes operators\r\n\r\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\r\n\r\nSince BTC is getting bigger and bigger, the incentive to run a full bitcoin node is just ridiculous.\r\nData storage cost a lot, and laptop manufacturers doesn't give a damn about it.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to reward full nodes with a few satoshis, 5k sat would be a good start.\r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nA good alternative would be to take parts of the miner's fees and spread them across the nodes who relayed transactions.\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\nI think there is a way to make it fair for everyone, and i know this was discussed for a while, but it would be good to have an update about this anyways.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is something to be done through lightning ???\r\n\r\nI would love to run a full BTC node with txindex and all, but god damn it it is too expencive !",
