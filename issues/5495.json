    "body": "CKey::MakeNewKey is responsible for generating a new private key using a cryptographic PRNG. The rest of key metadata is then generated by CWallet::GenerateNewKey.\n\nHowever, the GenerateNewKey function does not call MakeNewKey before ensuring RandAddSeedPerfmon is done. If increasing the uncertainty about the state and making the PRNG output less predictable is the message to send, the step then might as well be implemented in the MakeNewKey function itself.\n\nThe initial Sanity Check, and tests are the two other consumers of the function, neither RandAddSeedPerfmon-ing. The latter out of, presumably, performance considerations. Nevertheless, the CKey access modifiers, and the ongoing libification tipped me over to log this, as it is something to consider as we move forward (in light of recent events...).\n",

I have no objection to moving things around so long as people are confident that it's low risk, but I don't think a lot of time would be well spent micro-twiddling the details on this.  (Also, not sure about which recent events you refer to, but ... we have never had a randomness related incident in Bitcoin core and take auditing, review, and testing of these components very seriously. Some places where there have been issues have had issues in part due to unnecessary small changes, something to keep in mind.)\n",

Potential solution.\r\n\r\n\"CKey::MakeNewKey is responsible for generating a new private key using a cryptographic PRNG. The rest of key metadata is then generated by CWallet::GenerateNewKey.\r\n\r\nHowever, the GenerateNewKey function does not call MakeNewKey before ensuring RandAddSeedPerfmon is done. If increasing the uncertainty about the state and making the PRNG output less predictable is the message to send, the step then might as well be implemented in the MakeNewKey function itself.\r\n\r\nThe initial Sanity Check, and tests are the two other consumers of the function, neither RandAddSeedPerfmon-ing. The latter out of, presumably, performance considerations. Nevertheless, the CKey access modifiers, and the ongoing libification tipped me over to log this, as it is something to consider as we move forward (in light of recent events...).\"\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5508\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/5495",
