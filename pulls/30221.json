    "body": "Implements the idea discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29652#issuecomment-2010579484\r\n\r\nCurrently, `m_last_block_processed` and `m_last_block_processed_height` are not guaranteed to match the block locator stored in the wallet, nor do either of those fields actually represent the last block that the wallet is synced up to. This is confusing and unintuitive.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the those last block fields to actually be in sync with the record stored on disk. This requires adding the block height to the `BESTBLOCK_NOMERKLE` record, which was done in a backwards compatible manner. Additionally, the issue with `chainStateFlushed` fixed in #29652 is also fixed here by removing `chainStateFlushed` entirely. The last block fields, now simply the best block, is updated for each `blockConnected` and `blockDisconnected` so that it does actually represent the block for which the wallet is synced up to.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to deal with, the best block fields are consolidated into a `BestBlock` struct which also has the serialization code with backwards compatibility.",

          "body": "This PR updates the `CWallet::chainStateFlushed` method to write the `m_last_block_processed` locator to the database as the wallet's best block instead of the chain tip locator.\r\n\r\nSaving the last block processed locator as the best block is less fragile than saving `chainStateFlushed` locator as best block.\r\n\r\nRight now wallet code relies on `blockConnected` notifications being sent before `chainStateFlushed` notifications, and on the `chainStateFlushed` locator pointing to the last connected block. But this is a fragile assumption that can be easily broken by `ActivateBestChain`/`ConnectTrace` changes, and in fact is currently broken (since d96c59cc5cd2f73f1f55c133c52208671fe75ef3 from #25740) when the assumeutxo snapshot block is validated. In that case the background validation `chainStateFlushed` notification is sent _before_ the `blockConnected` notification so writing the locator as the best block would record a best block that was never processed. This specific change does not cause a problem for the wallet, because the wallet ignores events from the background validation chainstate. But nothing prevents similar out-of-order `chainStateFlushed` notifications from being sent in the future, so it is safer for the wallet to not rely on the chain tip sent in `chainStateFlushed` notifications.\r\n\r\nA good followup to this change would probably be to drop the `ChainStateFlushed` locator argument entirely so it is not misused in the future. Indexing code already stopped using this locator argument a long time ago for identifying the best block (in 4368384f1d267b011e03a805f934f5c47e2ca1b2 from #14121), though it is currently using the locator argument to log diagnostic warnings.",

          "body": "This PR contains the first part of #28608, which tries to make assumeutxo code more maintainable, and improve it by not locking `cs_main` for a long time when the snapshot block is connected, and by deleting the snapshot validation chainstate when it is no longer used, instead of waiting until the next restart.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR are just refactoring. They make `Chainstate` objects self-contained, so for example, it is possible to determine what blocks to connect to a chainstate without querying `ChainstateManager`, and to determine whether a Chainstate is validated without basing it on inferences like `&cs != &ActiveChainstate()` or `GetAll().size() == 1`.\r\n\r\nThe PR also tries to make assumeutxo terminology less confusing, using \"current chainstate\" to refer to the chainstate targeting the current network tip, and \"historical chainstate\" to refer to the chainstate downloading old blocks and validating the assumeutxo snapshot. It removes uses of the terms \"active chainstate,\" \"usable chainstate,\" \"disabled chainstate,\" \"ibd chainstate,\" and \"snapshot chainstate\" which are confusing for various reasons.",

This PR refactors `CreateTransactionInternal` to:\r\n\r\n* Get the serialized size directly from the `CRecipient`: this sets us up in a future PR to calculate the serialized size of silent payment `CTxDestinations` (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201/commits/797e21c8c1bf393e668eeef8bb7ee9cae1e5e41e)\r\n* Use the new `GetSerializeSizeForRecipient` to move the serialize size calculation to *before* coin selection and the output creation to *after* coin selection: this also sets us up for silent payments sending in a future PR in that silent payments outputs cannot be created until after the inputs to the transaction have been selected\r\n\r\nAside from the silent payments use case, I think this structure logically makes more sense. As a reminder, move-only commits are best reviewed with something like `git diff -w --color-moved=dimmed-zebra`\r\n",

For example during reindexing it could write and sync the database each time a block is connected, even if the block is before the wallets birthday, or doesn't have any relevant transactions?\r\n\r\nI think it probably makes sense to write BESTBLOCK in a smarter way, and probably write it more frequently, but it seems unnecessary to have to write it every block, and it might be bad for performance now or make optimizations harder in the future.\r\n\r\nI'm also curious about the idea of saving height with the best block record. I could imagine this being useful, since IIRC parts of wallet loading are complicated by not knowing heights of transactions before the chain is attached, but it doesn't really seem like the height is used for much yet.

They allow writing code that is succinct and clear, and make it a lot easier to figure out what log levels are being used. Unfortunately, the new macros are slightly less general than than needed to be used throughout the codebase. Particularly:\r\n\r\n1. The new macros cannot be used conveniently in wallet code because wallet log prints are supposed to automatically attach wallet names to log messages.\r\n2. The new macros cannot be used in libbitcoinkernel code because they do not allow specifying a logger instance.\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, the only alternative approach to solving these problems would be to reimplement these macros outside the logging framework so they could be used by wallet and validation code. This PR just takes the approach of slightly generalizing these macros so they work everywhere.\r\n\r\n### Note to reviewers\r\n\r\nI'd encourage looking at the description and code changes in this PR to evaluate it and try to come an independent judgement before looking at the discussion history. Unfortunately and regrettably, I made some dismissive comments on the previous PR, so the discussion here starts out immediately heated.\r\n\r\nA summary of the disagreement is that ajtowns believes allowing log syntax `LogDebug(m_log, \"debug message\\n\")` is [harmful](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29256#issuecomment-2085586513) if log category is part of the `m_log` argument instead of being an explicit category constant. I think omitting the explicit category constant is not a big deal, cuts down on verbosity and repetition, and allows important features like logging to different instances, and automatically adding other metadata (like wallet filenames) to log messages. Other parts of the discussion refer to earlier versions of the PR, go down various tangents, and make the argument that this PR is unnecessary, not that it is harmful.",

This PR makes the wallet UI safer by not rendering transactions as fully confirmed until the background validation is done.\r\n\r\nInstead it shows the same icon as when a transaction has 1 confirmation.

          "body": "Last step in a chain of PRs (#26836, #28894, #28987, #29403).\r\n\r\nThe initial benchmark conducted locally showed a ~65% processing time reduction, on a SSD.\r\nResults, from the very first benchmark, can be found at the end of the description.\r\n\r\n#### Detailed Description:\r\nThe current wallet migration process performs only individual db writes. Accessing disk to\r\ndelete all legacy records, clone and clean each address book entry for every created wallet,\r\ncreate each new descriptor (with their corresponding master key, caches and key pool), and\r\nalso clone and delete each transaction that requires to be transferred to a different wallet.\r\n\r\nThis work consolidates all individual disk writes into two batch operations. One for the descriptors\r\ncreation from the legacy data and a second one for the execution of the migration process itself.\r\nEfficiently dumping all the information to disk at once atomically at the end of each process.\r\n\r\nThis represent a speed up and also a consistency improvement. During migration, we either\r\nwant to succeed or fail. No other outcomes should be accepted. We should never leave a\r\npartially migrated wallet on disk and request the user to manually restore the previous wallet from\r\na backup (at least not if we can avoid it).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since db transactions relevant to the key pool generation were also batched, this work\r\nalso speeds up the regular wallet creation process.\r\n\r\n#### Note for Testers:\r\nThe first commit introduces a benchmark for the migration process. This one can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master to compare results pre and post changes.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the benchmark setup may take some time (~70 seconds here) due to the absence\r\nof a batching mechanism for the address generation process (`GetNewDestination()` calls). Which,\r\nI plan to address in a separate PR, just to not continue expanding this PR.\r\n\r\n————————————————————————\r\n\r\nBenchmark on master (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:-----------\r\n|   65,093,884,958.00 |                0.02 |    0.0% |     65.09 | `WalletMigration`\r\n\r\nBenchmark on this branch (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|   22,926,814,750.00 |                0.04 |    0.0% |     22.93 | `WalletMigration`",

This TXO set is iterated for balance checking and coin selection preparation, which can still be slow for wallets that have had a lot of activity. This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

          "title": "wallet: Keep track of the wallet's own transaction outputs in memory",
          "body": "Currently, the wallet is not actually aware about its own transaction outputs. Instead, it will iterate all of the transactions stored in `mapWallet`, and then all of the outputs of those transactions, in order to figure out what belongs to it for the purposes of coin selection and balance calculation. For balance calculation, there is caching that results in it only iterating all of the transactions, but not all of the outputs. However when the cache is dirty, everything is iterated. This is especially problematic for wallets that have a lot of transactions, or transactions that have a lot of unrelated outputs (as may occur with coinjoins or batched payments).\r\n\r\nThis PR helps to resolve this issue by making the wallet track all of the outputs that belong to it in a new member `m_txos`. Note that this includes outputs that may have already been spent. Both balance calculation (`GetBalance`) and coin selection (`AvailableCoins`) are updated to iterate `m_txos`. This is generally faster since it ignores all of the unrelated outputs, and it is not slower as in the worst case of wallets containing only single output transactions, it's exactly the same number of outputs iterated.\r\n\r\n`m_txos` is memory only, and it is populated during wallet loading. When each transaction is loaded, all of its outputs are checked to see if it is `IsMine`, and if so, an entry added to `m_txos`. When new transactions are received, the same procedure is done.\r\n\r\nSince imports can change the `IsMine` status of a transaction (although they can only be \"promoted\" from watchonly to spendable), all of the import RPCs will be a bit slower as they re-iterate all transactions and all outputs to update `m_txos`.\r\n\r\nEach output in `m_txos` is stored in a new `WalletTXO` class. This class contains references to the parent `CWalletTx` and the `CTxOut` itself. It also caches the `IsMine` value of the txout. This should be safe as `IsMine` should not change unless there are imports. This allows us to have additional performance improvements in places that use these `WalletTXO`s as they can use the cached `IsMine` rather than repeatedly calling `IsMine` which can be expensive.\r\n\r\nThe existing `WalletBalance` benchmark demonstrates the performance improvement that this PR makes. The existing `WalletAvailableCoins` benchmark doesn't as all of the outputs used in that benchmark belong to the test wallet. I've updated that benchmark to have a bunch of unrelated outputs in each transaction so that the difference is demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a larger project to have the wallet actually track and store a set of its UTXOs.\r\n\r\nBuilt on #24914 as it requires loading the txs last in order for `m_txos` to be built correctly.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks:\r\n\r\nMaster:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       92,245,141.50 |               10.84 |    0.1% |  988,823,975.00 |  66,803,340.50 |    0.0% |      2.04 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            5,709.90 |          175,134.50 |    0.5% |       80,968.24 |      25,539.15 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|          139,396.17 |            7,173.80 |    0.6% |    1,383,390.50 |     430,276.86 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            5,055.80 |          197,792.47 |    0.3% |       80,968.10 |      25,539.02 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|                9.79 |      102,152,396.19 |    0.1% |          161.00 |          37.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,552,736.00 |              644.02 |    1.5% |   20,316,315.80 |     618,545.80 |    0.6% |      0.08 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|      114,114,732.00 |                8.76 |    0.5% |1,291,047,717.60 | 320,244,602.00 |    0.0% |      6.30 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      359,315,754.00 |                2.78 |    0.1% |4,339,447,818.00 | 136,619,757.00 |    0.7% |      1.80 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|       98,230,601.00 |               10.18 |    0.1% |  537,688,964.00 |  97,332,266.00 |    0.3% |      0.49 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n\r\nPR:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       75,319,868.50 |               13.28 |    0.2% |  863,758,229.00 |  30,892,593.00 |    0.2% |      1.66 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            2,367.62 |          422,364.95 |    1.0% |       35,785.05 |       9,893.01 |    0.2% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|            2,685.58 |          372,359.55 |    0.2% |       36,501.05 |      10,027.01 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            3,462.24 |          288,830.68 |    2.7% |       35,785.06 |       9,893.01 |    0.3% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|               11.65 |       85,838,176.97 |    0.1% |          180.00 |          42.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,563,092.60 |              639.76 |    1.5% |   20,426,154.40 |     649,953.80 |    0.6% |      0.09 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|       58,367,804.40 |               17.13 |    0.9% |  587,164,005.00 | 107,905,843.80 |    0.1% |      3.21 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      365,302,636.00 |                2.74 |    0.2% |4,349,345,147.00 | 138,730,668.00 |    0.8% |      1.83 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|      124,995,585.00 |                8.00 |    1.2% |  801,998,316.00 | 103,210,721.00 |    0.3% |      0.63 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n",

This is only possible for taproot inputs, as taproot spends may look identical for \"dumb wallets\" and \"smart contracts\" iff they use the key-path spend.\r\n\r\nSequence-based locking has minimally lower anti-fee sniping guarantees if all the txs that created the inputs aren't itself locked to the block they were included in. However, the minimal degradation should be acceptable, given that anti-fee-snipe will set the locktime to the past of 10% of the txs anyway.",

      "body": "The idea of saving heights is interesting to me because wallet code assumes it know block heights many places, but it doesn't actually store heights anywhere. So for example, if the wallet stored a mapping of block hashes to heights (or other block information) it might be useful for allowing the wallet to work in an offline mode or letting the wallet CLI tool have more capabilities. This is all pretty abstract though, so I'm not suggesting something specific.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps an easy solution to this is to just write the best block every 1000 blocks (or some other interval) when we are in IBD?\r\n\r\nYes but I think that just adds back the complexity you were trying to get rid of, in a form that seems worse than the status quo. If you implement that, the wallet will be back to tracking the last block processed separately from the best block written to the database. And now, instead of the node determining when data should be flushed to disk and having all wallets flush that data simultaneously, each wallet will have internal logic deciding when to flush. This would be more complicated, and could be worse for power consumption and performance if there are multiple wallets and flushes are happening more frequently at different times.\r\n\r\nI think overall this PR is doing some good things, but the goals seem either not clear, or not clearly good, so I wonder if maybe you could take these changes and make more targeted PRs for the things you want to achieve?\r\n\r\nOr, if this PR is definitely the direction you want to go, I'm happy to review it. I don't like some things it is doing, but overall I think it is a reasonable change.",
