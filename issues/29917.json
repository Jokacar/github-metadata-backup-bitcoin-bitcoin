    "title": "Windows 11 Blocks Install Due to \"Virus Found\"",
    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nWindows 11 Microsoft Defender blocks the installation of Bitcoin-Core version 27.0.0 due to a virus being found. Smartscreen also blocks the installer. I was able to get it installed by telling Microsoft Defender to ignore the \"virus\" but since this is the default behavior of Windows 11 now this could be an issue for new users who don't know anything.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThat the installer is not blocked.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nDownload installer from Bitcoin-Core website and attempt to run it in Windows 11. Installer will run but the actual bitcoin executable will start and then immediately be stopped by Windows 11 from running.\r\n\r\nThe exact error Windows gives is: operation did not complete successfully because file contains virus\r\n\r\nThe virus that Windows claims to be finding is: Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B!ml\n\n### Relevant log output\n\nNo log is generated as the executable is blocked.\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPre-built binaries\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv27.0.0\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
