    "body": "This replaces #28674, #29036, and #29057. Now ready for testing and review.\r\n\r\nReplaces platform-specific endian and byteswap functions. This is especially useful for kernel, as it means that our deep serialization code no longer requires bitcoin-config.h.\r\n\r\nI apologize for the size of the last commit, but it's hard to avoid making those changes at once.\r\n\r\nAll platforms now use our internal functions rather than libc or platform-specific ones, with the exception of MSVC.\r\n\r\nSadly, benchmarking showed that not all compilers are capable of detecting and optimizing byteswap functions, so compiler builtins are instead used where possible. However, they're now detected via macros rather than autoconf checks.\r\n\r\nThis[ matches how libc++ implements std::byteswap for c++23](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/__bit/byteswap.h#L26).\r\n\r\nI suggest we move/rename `compat/endian.h`, but I left that out of this PR to avoid bikeshedding.\r\n\r\n#29057 pointed out some irregularities in benchmarks. After messing with various compilers and configs for a few weeks with these changes, I'm of the opinion that we can't win on every platform every time, so we should take the code that makes sense going forward. That said, if any real-world slowdowns are caused here, we should obviously investigate.",

          "body": "This implements a safegcd-based modular inverse for MuHash3072. It is a fairly straightforward translation of [the libsecp256k1 implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/831), with the following changes:\r\n* Generic for 32-bit and 64-bit\r\n* Specialized for the specific MuHash3072 modulus (2^3072 - 1103717).\r\n* A bit more C++ish\r\n* Far fewer sanity checks\r\n\r\nA benchmark is also included for MuHash3072::Finalize. The new implementation is around 100x faster on x86_64 for me (from 5.8 ms to 57 μs); for 32-bit code the factor is likely even larger.\r\n\r\nFor more information:\r\n  * [Original paper](https://gcd.cr.yp.to/papers.html) by Daniel J. Bernstein and Bo-Yin Yang\r\n  * [Implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/767) for libsecp256k1 by Peter Dettman; and the [final](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/831) version\r\n  * [Explanation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/doc/safegcd_implementation.md) of the algorithm using Python snippets\r\n  * [Analysis](https://github.com/sipa/safegcd-bounds) of the maximum number of iterations the algorithm needs\r\n   * [Formal proof in Coq](https://medium.com/blockstream/a-formal-proof-of-safegcd-bounds-695e1735a348) by Russell O'Connor (for the 256-bit version of the algorithm; here we use a 3072-bit one).\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [ ] Add more tests\r\n",
