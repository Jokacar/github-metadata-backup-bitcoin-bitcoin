    "title": "Implement nested multi-paper backup",
    "body": "By \"paper backup\" I mean what is commonly associated with it:\n- To be able to print out the private keys of a wallet, in both human readable and computer readable format\n- To include the public keys in human readable and computer readable format, so you can quickly check whether the paper still holds value.\n- To be able to import the backup easily.\n\nBy \"multi\" I mean something similar to \"encrypted\" or \"N-factor authentication\":\n- The backup should consist of multiple sheets. It should only be possible to spend the Bitcoins if you have ALL of the sheets. This allows you to keep the backup safe from physical theft by splitting it to different locations.\n- Ideally, the amount of sheets should be freely configurable. \n- It can be implemented by having a long password for the wallet which is split into equal-sized parts and each sheet containing only one part. This allows the user to destroy one sheet and instead memorize the password which was on it. Then you effectively have an encrypted paper backup as a bonus feature.\n\nBy \"nested\" I mean something to provide plausible deniability:\n- It would be useful to not disclose the number of sheets on each sheet. Then an attacker cannot quickly tell whether he has all of them, and might quit searching for more.\n- To prevent the attacker from being able to determine whether he has all sheets, make each sheet represent a complete Bitcoin address, including private key. Fund that address with a decoy amount of Bitcoins.\n- Put the random seed used to generate the decoy address on each sheet. But also generate a \"primary\" Bitcoin address whose public/private keys are NOT mentioned on the sheets.\n- Instead, the primary key is generated by concatenating the random seeds used for generating the decoy addresses of _all_ sheets. Put 90% of the money into the primary address.\n- So ALL of the sheets combined would generate the \"actual\" address which holds the most amount of coins. But the attacker would stop trying to search more sheets once he has found one, because it DOES hold money. Just not all of it.\n- This could even be raised to a higher level: For each possible N out of M combinations of the sheets, also generate a decoy primary address which holds a little amount of Bitcoins. If the attacker believes that you had used the nesting feature and harasses you to hand out the remaining sheets, you can plausibly claim having given all of them to him, while you only revealed part of the whole.\n\nEven if the nesting is not implemented at first, I think at least the multi-sheet part is absolutely critical. One of the core advantages of Bitcoin surely is that they cannot be physically stolen because you can encrypt them. This is voided with physical paper backup which isn't split into multiple sheets.\n\nYou might argue that paper backup doesn't have to be implemented in Bitcoin-Qt because Bitcoin-Armory already supports it somehow. I think backup really should be a core feature of the reference Bitcoin client because it is a core advantage of Bitcoin. You cannot backup dollars. You can backup Bitcoins. \n\nPlease make the reference Bitcoin client more useful for the very paranoid.\n\n[Off-topic PS: I'm greedy and proud of the nesting idea, make me happy: 14EpAnasbwpeRH55mQZKX8GjZRnY6DCNsQ :) Admins please mail me if donation requests are not allowed, I will remove it then.]\n",

Bitcoin-QT should definitely support cold storage. I suggest to create Bitcoin addresses NOT storing the private keys in the wallet file or any other digital storage but printing them on paper using QR-codes and OCR-A font. Bitcoin-QT should also have functions to scan paperwallets, read their QR-codes, fall back to optical character recognition and verify the scanned private keys match the Bitcoin addresses.\n\nThis will prevent average-joes loosing their savings which would have a big negative impact on the reputaion of the Bitcoin system.\n",

          "body": "Financial privacy is an essential property of every monetary and payment system.  Without it the user's security is reduced due to targeted attacks, the freedom to associate and transact is limited, and their commercial interests may be compromised when competition can monitor their activity.\n\nThe importance of privacy was recognized in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, but the only approach available at the time (pseudonymous addresses) provides only limited privacy and what it does provide is highly brittle.  Advanced monitoring capabilities have substantially undermined this protection in practice, but at the same time technology has improved tremendously and we can now do much better than pseudonymous addresses.\n\nTightly linked to privacy is fungibility, an essential characteristic of a money like good.  When coins are overly distinguishable and people find themselves feeling obligated to consult (likely centralized) blacklists before accepting coins the utility of Bitcoin as a money is reduced.\n\nSome people previously believed stronger privacy was incompatible with public auditability, but just like digital signatures prove your know your private key without disclosing it we know that privacy and public verification are not incompatible in a very fundamental sense.\n\nBitcoin Core should have a comprehensive plan to give users state of the art technology in this regard, but we must respect the challenges of deploying new technology in an already existing ecosystem.  Progress can be made in a series of larger and smaller initiatives.\n\nThis issue with track other issues and collect discussion related to the overall strategy on this front.\n\nCurrently Open Issues (without pull requests):\n- Implement Coinjoin in walltet. #3226 \n- Change value privacy #6569\n\nProposed short term functionality:\n- Implement some kind of ephemeral (ECDH) address. \n- Improve privacy in coin selection\n- Include a private transaction submission tool enabled by default\n\nProposed longer term exploration:\n- Merkelized abstract syntax trees or other explicit support for script elision in the spirit of coinswap (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=321228.0) to keep smart contract terms as private as possible\n- Confidential transactions: What performance envelope, security considerations would we need from something like or zero cash to seriously consider it?\n",

      "body": "Sorry for excavating this ancient issue, but now that HD wallet are a thing, is there a way to create a paper/metal backup of wallets?\r\n\r\n`dumpwallet` produces a file that's too large to write down by hand, realistically.\r\n\r\nThe hd seed is, from what I gather, something that could be used later with `sethdseed` on a new wallet to regenerate the same keys, but would this work on a cold machine (without blocks/headers)? I'm getting a \"can't do this before IBD finishes\" error when trying this method on `0.20.1`, so I'm assuming no one is really using this method.\r\n\r\nSorry again if this isn't the proper forum to ask theses sort of question, in which case I'd be happy to post elsewhere if you could point me in the right direction. I'm trying to design a cold wallet solution using core just as a wallet (no inet) and got stuck...",
