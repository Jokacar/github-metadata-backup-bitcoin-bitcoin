    "title": "Mining Interface doesn't allow for Bitcoin Core to create blocks when it wants",
    "body": "Finally getting around to reviewing the mining interface, and sadly its missing some critical features that a new mining protocol should have. Specifically, one of the key goals of replacing `getblocktemplate` is that Bitcoin Core should be able to push work to clients at opportune times. This includes the ability to create a new block in between validating a new block and updating the mempool for a full CNB run. Sadly, forcing the client of the interface to explicitly call CNB makes this impossible.",
