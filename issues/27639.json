    "body": "It seems that script verification is being run during the rebuilding of the UTXO database, which, if the intention is simply to rebuild the UTXO (due to a disk corruption) then this ought to be unnecessary given the verification has already occurred.\r\n\r\nGPT-4 suggested a simple code-change, although it's a little more complex than this as it needs to ensure that the script verification is only skipped on blocks we can be sure have previously been checked.\r\n\r\nGPT-4's suggestion nevertheless: https://shareg.pt/qDkfAkx (I love how it's familiar with the project's code though!)",
