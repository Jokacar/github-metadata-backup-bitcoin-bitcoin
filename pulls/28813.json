      "message": "[validation] linearize using fees + submit ancestor subpackages\n\nGeneral algorithm:\n1. Basic sanitization to ensure package is well formed and not too big\n   to work on.\n2. Linearize (based on topological sort).\n3. PreChecks loop: call PreChecks on all transactions to get fees and\n   vsizes, and to find obvious errors for which we should skip parts of\n   the package or abort validation altogether.\n4. Linearize (based on ancestor set score).\n5. For each transaction in the new linearized order, submit with its\n   subpackage (or skip if subpackage/individual feerate is too low).\n6. Limit mempool size and backfill map of MempoolAcceptResults.\n\nQ: What's so great about doing a fee-based linearization?\nLinearization helps us understand which transactions need to be grouped\ntogether as CPFPs. This helps us skip the low feerate parent and wait\nuntil we see it in the high feerate child's ancestor package; another\napproach would be to retry submission with another grouping, but we want\nto avoid repeated validation. Linearization also helps us try to accept\nthe highest feerate subset of the package when we don't don't have room\nfor all of it. For example, if each of the transactions in the package\nshare an ancestor whose descendant limits only permit one, we should try\nthe highest feerate transaction(s) first.\n\nQ: Why use PreChecks to get fees and vsize?\nWe need the fee and vsize of each transaction, which requires looking up\ninputs. While some of the work done in PreChecks might not be necessary,\nit applies fail-fast anti-DoS checks that we definitely want (e.g. a\ntransaction that is too big could thus cause us to load too many UTXOs).\nIn the future, we may also be interested in using information like the\ntransaction's mempool conflicts and ancestor set (calculated in\nPreChecks) in the linearization or quit early logic. So PreChecks is\nbest for this purpose.\n\nQ: We don't know if txns have valid signatures yet, so if something is\ninvalid, we might have a suboptimal linearization/grouping. Should we\nregroup or retry in that case?\nNo. If the peer maliciously constructs a package this way, there isn't\nmuch we can do to find the \"optimal subset\" without doing a ton of work.\nGenerally, we hope to only validate each transaction 1 time.\nInstead, we just hope we have another honest peer that will send us the\n\"normal\" package.",

          "body": "This contains everything to make mempool/validation logic ready for package relay (see #27463).\r\n\r\nDesign goals:\r\n- Be able to gracefully deal with any arbitrary list of transactions (these come from p2p)\r\n- Validate any ancestor package so that the incentive-compatible transactions end up in our mempool.\r\n  - If the transactions would be accepted individually, they should also be accepted through `AcceptPackage`. We don't want to accidentally reject things just because we happened to download them as a package.\r\n  - Bug prior to these changes: we required `IsChildWithParents` but if there were dependencies between the parents, we could end up (1) accepting a low-feerate child or (2) rejecting a high-feerate parent CPFPing another parent. See the \"interdependent parents\" test case for a specific example.\r\n- Be DoS-resistant.\r\n   - Avoid quadratic validation costs.\r\n   - Avoid loading a lot of stuff from disk, or loading repeatedly.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 main improvements to package evaluation here:\r\n(1) We submit transactions with their in-package ancestor sets.\r\n\t-  See unit test `package_ppfp`: without this change, we would reject everything.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_ppfc`: shows that this doesn't let us do \"parent pays for child;\" we only do this when the individual and ancestor feerates meet mempool minimum feerate\r\n(2) We linearize the package transactions based on ancestor set scoring.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_needs_reorder`: without this change, if we use the original order of transactions, we would only accept 1 grandparent, even if we submit subpackages.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_desc_limits`: without this change, we accept one of the lower-feerate transactions (a bit more of a \"nice to have\" than a \"must have\" example).\r\n\r\nA description of the package validation logic (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26711#issuecomment-1647523520):\r\n\r\n- Basic sanitization. Quit if it's too big, inconsistent, etc.\r\n- Linearize (Topological sort only)\r\n- **PreChecks loop** For each tx, grab UTXOs to calculate fees and filter out anything we should skip:\r\n    - If already in mempool (or same txid in mempool), mark as skip\r\n    - If missing inputs or conflict, record this failure and mark this and all descendants as skip.\r\n    - If no failures or TX_SINGLE_FAILURE, continue\r\n    - For some failures that we expect due to differing chainstates, skip these transactions and their descendants, but continue.\r\n    - Otherwise, record this failure and mark that we will `quit_early` (i.e. not do the Subpackage validation loop).\r\n- Refine our linearization using the fee information.\r\n- **Subpackage validation loop** For each transaction in the new linearized order:\r\n    - Get the transaction's ancestor subpackage.\r\n    - If the feerate of this transaction is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - If the feerate of this subpackage is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - Otherwise, try to submit the subpackage, using `AcceptSingleTransaction()` if it's just 1 tx\r\n    - if at any point we get a non-fee-related error, abort all.\r\n- Call `LimitMempoolSize`\r\n- Backfill results:\r\n    - If the transaction was in mempool, check to see if it's still there in case it was trimmed in `LimitMempoolSize`.\r\n    - Try to use results from the subpackage validation loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early), use results from prechecks loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early and we hadn't found a failure with it yet), fill with `TX_UNKNOWN`.\r\n\r\nThis means we will call `PreChecks` for each transaction 2 times (fewer if we quit early), and run all other validation checks at most 1 time. A transaction shouldn't be validated in the subpackage validation loop more than once.",

          "body": "Motivation\r\n* It seems preferable to use stdlib data structures instead of boost if they can achieve close to the same thing.\r\n* Code external to mempool should ideally use its public helper methods instead of accessing `mapTx` or its iterators directly.\r\n* Reduce the number of complex boost multi index type interactions\r\n* Also see #28335 for further context/motivation. This PR together with #28385 simplifies that one.\r\n\r\nOverview of things done in this PR:\r\n* Make `vTxHashes` a vector of transaction references instead of a pair of transaction hash and iterator. The trade off here is that the iterator is retrieved on the fly with `get_iter_from_wtxid` instead of being cached in `vTxHashes`.\r\n* Introduce `GetEntry` helper method to replace the more involved `GetIter` where applicable\r\n* Replace `mapTx` access with `CTxMemPool` helper methods\r\n  * Please note when reviewing that `infoAll` is already in other places that grab all mempool transactions as well, such as in net_processing when responding to bip35 messages.\r\n* Simplify `checkChainLimits` call in `node/interfaces.cpp`\r\n* Make `CTxMemPoolEntry`s `lockPoints`mutable such that they can be changed with a const iterator directly instead of going through `mapTx`\r\n* Make `BlockAssembler`'s `inBlock` and `failedTx` sets of transaction hashes.",

          "title": "RFC: Remove boost usage from kernel api / headers",
          "body": "Similarly to #28327 I wanted to open this PR to receive some opinions and better approaches.\r\n\r\nThe kernel library is currently at the stage where unwanted headers are removed from its set of headers. In practice, this means we are reducing the number of includes that are required for compiling the experimental `bitcoin-chainstate` binary. This is described in stage 1 step 3 of the [project tracking issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).\r\n\r\nCurrently the mempool is part of the kernel library. The mempool headers include the boost multi index headers. Thus any application wanting to use the kernel library and its headers will have to include the boost headers too. This is not only undesirable because of the sheer size of these headers, but also might lead to conflicts if the including application uses a different boost version.\r\n\r\nIn the approach laid out by this PR, mempool member variables and methods are declared in the header without having to include boost by either wrapping them in a struct and [pimpling](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl) them, or making methods static implementation functions. The boost definitions are gathered into separate header (`mempool_set_definitions.h`) that is only included by implementation files that require definitions of the boost types. This allows us to retain the current architecture with roughly the same interfaces. \r\n\r\nThe approach laid out by this PR also has some, albeit small, compilation speed and size benefits. Averaged over a few of compilation runs I consistently observe faster compilation by a couple of seconds and some smaller pre-processed and compiled object sizes. The main detractor of this method is obviously the number of lines touched. However it also has the benefit of inventorizing all the files that require direct access to the mempool data structures as well getting rid of boost multi index includes in non-kernel implementation files that include the mempool, but don't directly manipulate its data structures (e.g. wallet.cpp).\r\n\r\nA much simpler alternative approach, at least on the surface, would be removing all `txmempool.h` includes from kernel library headers (see [this branch](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/mempoolBoostSimple)). Currently this is only `validation.h`.  Due to the mutex member of `CTxMemPool` and the correspondingly defined lock decorators on the chainstate methods this becomes a bit more complicated though and I am not sure how this might be possible with the current architecture.\r\n\r\nA discussion of how and if to remove the mempool from the kernel library has so far been intentionally punted to the next stage of the kernel library development. Pimpling the mempool itself precludes this discussion, since the library could never be shipped with the `CTxMemPool` headers. Pimpling the mempool members (like done in this PR) might also make a future splitting of block and mempool validation logic into separate compilation units easier.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on #28391 which simplifies some of the required refactors.",
