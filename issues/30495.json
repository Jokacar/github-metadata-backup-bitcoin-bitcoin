    "title": "Faster way to get block with prevouts in JSON-RPC",
    "body": "I often need to process the whole blockchain (or a large part of it) using an external script/program, for which I need blocks with prevout information included. However, the only current way to get that is `getblock <hash> 3`, which includes a lot of potentially unnecessary data and is quite slow, mainly (based on my experiments) because of `UniValue` overhead and descriptor inferring.\r\n\r\nI benchmarked current master, retrieving 1000 blocks sequentially starting at block 840000, with different `verbosity` parameters:\r\n\r\n|benchmark|result|\r\n|-|-|\r\n|getblock (verbosity=0)|16.189s ± 1.165s|\r\n|getblock (verbosity=1)|31.975s ± 1.014s|\r\n|getblock (verbosity=2)|352.487s ± 1.636s|\r\n|getblock (verbosity=3)|473.375s ± 2.280s|\r\n\r\nAs you can see, verbosity=3 is around 30 times slower than verbosity=0. It seems obvious that a faster way of getting blocks with prevout information is feasible.\r\n\r\nPotential solutions that come to mind:\r\n- Creating a new RPC call for undo data, say `getblockundo`. This would be perfect for my needs, but it would require making the undo data serialization format non-internal (not sure if this would be a problem, as IIRC it hasn't changed in many years).\r\n- Creating a new verbosity level for `getblock` that would only provide the minimum amount of data necessary (i.e. no addresses, descriptors, ASM scripts, TXIDs/WTXIDs etc.) while still providing prevouts. This would be better than nothing but would still leave a lot of performance on the table because of `UniValue` overhead.",

I added the function and benchmarked to see if there was a performance improvement. The results showed reduced mean times, particularly for verbosity levels 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n**Benchmark with `UniValue` Reservation**\r\n\r\n| Verbosity    | Strategy     | Iteration 1 | Iteration 2 | Iteration 3 | Mean   | Standard Deviation |\r\n|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|\r\n| **1**        | Sequential   | 122 sec     | 105 sec     | 107 sec     | 111 sec | 7 sec             |\r\n| **2**        | Sequential   | 3241 sec    | 3272 sec    | 3267 sec    | 3260 sec | 14 sec           |\r\n| **3**        | Sequential   | 4089 sec    | 4213 sec    | 4202 sec    | 4168 sec | 56 sec           |",

      "body": "I think there are two separate topics here: \r\n\r\n1. \"I need to process the entire blockchain for [an external application like electrs, data analysis, etc]\"\r\n2. We can probably make the JSON-RPC faster, via threading, batching, etc\r\n\r\nFor 1., @vostrnad have you seen #30595 ? For the specific ask of prevouts, I'm almost certain this will always be faster since the the kernel API provides the prevouts by reading the rev.dat files (admittedly, I haven't looked into how this is done with the `getblock` rpc, it might also be doing the same).\r\n\r\nHere is an example program I wrote using the kernel API via rust bindings: https://github.com/josibake/silent-payments-scanner/blob/74f883c370a26e2eaa5a1a7e8e18643e07ce2cff/src/scanner.rs#L135\r\n\r\nI found this very easy to write and incredibly performant. The nice thing about using the kernel API for this is you can use whatever language you want (so long as that language supports C-bindings), and it does not require a running `bitcoind` process to be able to process the block files, which seems well suited to the data analysis / index building use case.\r\n\r\nFor experimenting / testing the API, there is https://github.com/theCharlatan/rust-bitcoinkernel, and I've also been meaning to create some python bindings, as well. If this is of interest to you, I'd be happy to explain more and of course would love your feedback on the C API PR.",

      "body": "Thank you, @josibake, for highlighting this! I was able to perform some benchmarks to evaluate the performance you claimed of using \r\n- Rust wrapper by @TheCharlatan https://github.com/TheCharlatan/rust-bitcoinkernel\r\n-  Python wrapper by @stickies-v  https://github.com/stickies-v/py-bitcoinkernel\r\n\r\nAs you claimed, this is indeed more performant.\r\n### Benchmark Results:\r\n\r\nI used the libbitcoinkernel library to imitate extracting block data for the same interval block heights 840000 to 841000, the average execution times are as follows:\r\n1. **Rust bindings**: ~87 seconds, tested using https://github.com/ismaelsadeeq/rs-blockparser\r\n\r\n2. **Python bindings**: ~612 seconds, tested using https://github.com/ismaelsadeeq/py-blockparser\r\n\r\nFor the Python bindings, I suspect the inefficiency arises from the deserialization process handled by https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib because without the deserialization, the execution time drops significantly to around **62 seconds**, which is much closer to the Rust result.\r\n\r\nThe block data returned by these methods is equivalent to the `getblock` RPC with verbosity level 2.  \r\nFor verbosity level 3 (undo data alone), you can parse the undo files directly. Given the benchmark results, this approach is most likely faster than using the `getblock` RPC.\r\n\r\nBut this approach has some downside I think:\r\n1. **Data Directory Access**: The `libbitcoinkernel` approach requires `bitcoind` to be shut down, as multiple clients cannot access the `datadir` simultaneously.  \r\n2. **Sequential Process**: This is sequential i.e only one parser can run at a time, whereas RPC calls allow asynchronous execution, enabling multiple clients to access the RPC interface simultaneously while `bitcoind` is still running.\r\n\r\nThe language bindings (Rust and Python) make it straightforward to build blockchain parsers and other applications, which is a significant advantage. However, this should not deter us from improving the performance of RPC calls, as they remain a  widely-used interface for clients. Any chance to optimizing performance like #31490 #31539 #31179 would benefit a broader range of users..\r\n\r\nI think this result is convincing enough to close this issue @vostrnad  ",
