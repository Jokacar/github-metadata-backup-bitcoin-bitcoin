    "body": "Sister ticket for #993 Windows.\r\n\r\nFor reasons I can't wrap my around there's doesn't seem to be a way for OSX applications to clean up after themselves after a user drags them into the trash can.\r\n\r\nOne workaround could be for QT to check if `~/Application Support/Bitcoin` already exists. If not, it would store the blockchain and other non-wallet data _in the application package itself_ and put a symlink in `~/Application Support/Bitcoin` so Bitcoind can find it. This might be quite brittle though.\r\n\r\nAnother approach is to put an uninstall button inside QT, somewhere in the settings. This would work for Linux as well. In Windows it would just launch the standalone uninstaller. The uninstall button would have a check box:\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to delete the blockchain data? [x GB]\", checked by default\r\n\r\nIn addition it would say: \"your wallet will remain in [PATH]\" and will be used again if you decide to reinstall in the future.",

          "body": "If a user intends to uninstall the app, it would be nice if the related cache data (the potentially huge blockchain cache) were deleted too. According to common convention, a directory created under Library, say:  `~/Library/Application Support/${TheApp}` should match, or start with, the name of its creator. Dependent files can start with \"TheApp\", e.g. you can have `TheApp-common` and so on.\n\nIn our case of the GUI BitCoin client, the application is distributed as \"**Bitcoin-Qt**\" and as a consequence anyone looking for related files will fail finding `~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin` as it does not match =~ `/^Bitcoin-Qt.*/`. _AppZapper_ is a common example of this.\n\nRelated: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5029410/how-to-detect-files-related-to-an-app-on-a-mac\n",
