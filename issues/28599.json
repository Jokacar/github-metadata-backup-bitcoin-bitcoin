This issue is to list what projects are ongoing that can be voted on.

Comments in this issue from those outside of the organization will be ignored, and may be deleted. If you are not part of the organization and believe that you should be, please send me an email or message me on IRC.\r\n\r\nInitial list from recent CoreDev:\r\n\r\n* Multiprocess #10102 \r\n* Silent payments #28536\r\n* Package Relay #27463\r\n* Legacy wallet (BDB) removal #20160\r\n* Erlay #21515\r\n* Cmake #28607\r\n* Kernel #27587\r\n* Logging Migration #25203\r\n* Stratum V2 #27854\r\n* Cluster mempool #27677\r\n\r\nAssumeUTXO and BIP 324 were on this list originally, but they seem to be done now?",
