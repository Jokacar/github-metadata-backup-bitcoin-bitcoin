      "body": "OK, so I believe I understand the bug.\r\nestimatesmartfee takes the max of three different sub-estimates:\r\n- 60% threshold at half the target\r\n- 85% threshold at the target\r\n- 95% threshold at double the target\r\n\r\nAn estimate for a higher target should be monotonically decreasing in each of those 3 sub-estimates.  So therefore the final estimates should also be monotonically decreasing.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is the possibility that one of the sub-estimates is unable to return an estimate because there is no fee rate that is high enough to meet the threshold.  The algorithm was designed to just return the max of the other sub-estimates in this case with the reasoning being that it is better to give some estimate rather than give up and revert to the fallback fee or have a potentially computationally expensive search for the lowest target which is able to return all sub-estimates.   The downside of this is that if a higher target can return that sub-estimate, it might actually be higher than either of the other sub-estimates at the lower target and cause a final estimate which is actually greater for the higher target.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's not ideal, I think this falls in the category of \"won't fix\".  What is really happening in this edge case is that the estimate for the lower target is perhaps not as high as it should be.  But in analyzing a proper fix, I think that time would be better spent either doing a wholesale improvement to fee estimation, or working on better RBF or CPFP tools.\r\n\r\nI believe that given current fee markets this should be very unlikely on mainnet, and that if conditions were to arise that made this more likely, we probably need a better fee estimation algorithm anyway.  Also the raw data is accessible through estimaterawfee which could allow anyone to make their own more complicated combination of sub-estimates if they really care.\r\n\r\n",

This is a ridiculous value because the blocks are not full and the reason is that some of the miners for some reasons currently do not mine segwit transactions at all. Since some of these segwit transactions carry a huge fee and are nevertheless not mined, the estimatesmartfee increases the estimate to take it into account.\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\r\nThe estimate algorithm believes the reason the transactions are not mined are too low fees but there are apparently non-monetary reasons. I think the algorithm should also look at the transaction with the  5-10% lowest fees to check if there are lower-paying transactions that are confirmed and in this case, lower the estimate to these values since it means that such a fee is enough. Without such a check even a small cartel of the miners can significantly increase the estimates (by not confirming several percent of the high-paying transactions) and since the estimator is fairly widely used can book a profit. Even now, there are a few miners on the mainnet (e.g. bw.com) that do not mine segwit transactions at all and it's possible that there is some impact on the estimatesmartfee for 1 or 2 blocks\r\n\r\nOf course, if estimatesmartfee  looks at the bottom 5-10% of the transactions, the miners can game the estimate downwards (by confirming below market fee transactions) but at least in this case, the gaming cannot be profitable is is, in my opinion, preferable to the current system. \r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.

Therefore we getting fees for ETH from API (gasstation) :)\r\n\r\nMy only idea on how to improve that without API usage is \"custom tx fee\" for BTC txs in trades which expereienced users might set similar as it's possible to set for withdrawal calls.\r\n\r\nMost practical solution imo is to use some BTC pegged asset for such BTC applications as atomic swaps. There is https://wbtc.network/ for example, but funny thing is that now avg. ETH tx fees almost on the same level with BTC avg. tx fees (but since we getting it from gasstation it's 4-5 times lower than for BTC fees  atm in adex)",

          "body": "So I was fiddling with feerates today. I bumped into https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13283, but this seemed different.\r\n\r\nI have the following setup:\r\n- `-regtest` and `-minrelaytxfee=0.00001100` \r\n- one node makes a block every some seconds\r\n- other node has `-mintxfee=0.00001100` as well and connects to that node and creates a tx with createraw+fundraw+signraw+sendraw\r\n\r\nOn fundraw, I use `\"{\\\"feeRate\\\": 0.00001100}\"`.\r\n\r\nResult: the txs of the second node don't get relayed to the first node and don't get mined.\r\n\r\nSo my main reason for this research was to observe fee estimation. After a while, `estimatesmartfee 3` gives a feerate of `0.00001097`, which is just below the feeRate supposedly set in every txs in the blockchain & mempool (which seems weird on itself), but is also lower than the `minRelayTxFee` for that node.",
