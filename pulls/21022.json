    "body": "After #21016, `boost::shared_mutex` will basically be the last component of Boost Thread that Bitcoin Core is using. However, [a comment in #16684](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16684#issuecomment-726214696), pointed out that `std::shared_mutex` may be unsafe to use, when coupled with a range of glibc versions ~2.26->2.29, which may block our adoption and the removal of Boost Thread. \r\n\r\nNote that the comment first links to [\"rdlock stalls indefinitely on an unlocked pthread rwlock\"](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23861), but then to the [Ubuntu bugtracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc/+bug/1864864), which is actually for a different pthread bug: [\"pthread_rwlock_trywrlock results in hang\"](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23844). This PR contains a modified version of the code to reproduce the second bug, for which a backport was done for Ubuntu 18.04s glibc (2.27-3ubuntu1.3).\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce the hanging behaviour using the following. (You could also use any demos from the linked bug reports).\r\n\r\nRun a Bionic container, and install build dependencies. Clone the source and checkout this branch:\r\n```bash\r\ndocker run -it --rm ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash\r\n\r\napt update && apt upgrade -y\r\napt install git build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config bsdmainutils python3 libevent-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev -y\r\n\r\ngit clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\r\ngit fetch origin pull/21022/head:21022\r\ngit checkout 21022\r\n```\r\n\r\nConfigure, disabling the wallet (unrelated) and enabling glibc back compat, so that our sanity checks are enabled:\r\n```bash\r\n./autogen.sh\r\n./configure --disable-wallet --enable-glibc-back-compat\r\nmake src/bitcoind -j8\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore running bitcoind, check which version of libc you have installed. `23844` was fixed in `1.3`, so running `1.4` should mean no issues:\r\n```bash\r\napt-cache policy libc6\r\nlibc6:\r\n  Installed: 2.27-3ubuntu1.4\r\n  Candidate: 2.27-3ubuntu1.4\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun bitcoind\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoind\r\nTesting pthread trylock_wr\r\n\r\n2021-01-28T13:24:39Z Bitcoin Core version v21.99.0-1e601c9d60f9 (release build)\r\n2021-01-28T13:24:39Z Assuming ancestors of block 0000000000000000000b9d2ec5a352ecba0592946514a92f14319dc2b367fc72 have valid signatures.\r\n2021-01-28T13:24:39Z Setting nMinimumChainWork=00000000000000000000000000000000000000001533efd8d716a517fe2c5008\r\n...\r\n# quit\r\n```\r\n\r\nDowngrade libc to `1.2`. You may need to uninstall `libc6-dev` first, otherwise it will block the downgrade of `libc6`:\r\n```bash\r\napt remove libc6-dev -y\r\napt install libc6=2.27-3ubuntu1.2 -y\r\n\r\n# check that you're running 1.2\r\napt-cache policy libc6\r\nlibc6:\r\n  Installed: 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\r\n  Candidate: 2.27-3ubuntu1.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nRun `bitcoind` again. Note that this will *hang*. You will not be able to quit.\r\n```bash\r\n# if it doesn't hang, quit and retry\r\n./src/bitcoind\r\nTesting pthread trylock_wr\r\n\r\n.... hanging\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it would be good to have more discussion around how we approach these sort of \"lower down the stack\" issues:\r\n\r\n* what sort of bug or issue warrants us from excluding a std library feature, i.e `std::shared_mutex`, from use? If you looked at the glibc issue tracker right now, you'd no doubt find half a dozen bugs across multiple versions of glibc that you may think warrant us excluding various things.\r\n* How widespread does the issue have to be? If it's in a single glibc version that is nearly EOL, that is obviously less of an issue compared to something affecting most recent versions.\r\n* how (in)tolerant are we of assuming that users are taking backports?\r\n* do we need to be more aggressive with runtime sanity checks? Should we be trying to detect more \"broken things\" that are applicable to us? \r\n\r\nIt would certainly be unfortunate if migrating to more standard library components was blocked for extended periods (Ubuntu Bionic is LTS until mid 2023), due to these kinds of bugs.",

          "title": "build: Explore building with musl as libc",
          "body": "This has been discussed briefly with theuni and fanquake in the past, but I want to put it out there as an issue for more general discussion. I recommend reading through musl's project introduction [here](https://www.musl-libc.org/intro.html). Reproduced:\r\n\r\n> musl provides consistent quality and implementation behavior from tiny embedded systems to full-fledged servers. Minimal machine-specific code means less chance of breakage on minority architectures and better success with “write once run everywhere” C development.\r\n>\r\n> musl's efficiency is unparalleled in Linux libc implementations. Designed from the ground up for static linking, musl carefully avoids pulling in large amounts of code or data that the application will not use. Dynamic linking is also efficient; by integrating the entire standard library implementation, including threads, math, and even the dynamic linker itself into a single shared object, most of the startup time and memory overhead of dynamic linking have been eliminated.\r\n>\r\n> musl features the first post-NPTL implementation of POSIX threads for Linux, and the first aimed at complete conformance and robustness. Thread cancellation has been re-designed to avoid serious race conditions in the original NPTL design. As for efficiency, the whole threads implementation weighs in at around 10-20k depending on target architecture and compiler settings.\r\n>\r\n> Not only the threads implementation, but all code in musl has been designed for realtime-quality robustness. Low-memory or resource exhaustion conditions are never fatal. musl has no unnecessary dynamic allocation and no unrecoverable late failures. All error conditions can be detected and handled by applications; interfaces for which an application could not reasonably handle failure do not fail.\r\n>\r\n> Using musl maximizes application deployability. Its permissive MIT license is compatible with all FOSS licenses, static-linking-friendly, and makes commercial use painless too. Binaries statically linked with musl have no external dependencies, even for features like DNS lookups or character set conversions that are implemented with dynamic loading on glibc. An application can really be deployed as a single binary file and run on any machine with the appropriate instruction set architecture and Linux kernel or Linux syscall ABI emulation layer.\r\n>\r\n> Finally, musl has simple source code and source tree layout, so it’s easy to customize or track down the cause of unexpected behavior or bugs, or simply learn how the library works.\r\n\r\nA few more resources for people to consider:\r\n\r\nIn-depth discussion of some design decisions: https://wiki.musl-libc.org/design-concepts.html\r\nA comparison of different libcs: http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html\r\nComprehensive compatibility information: https://wiki.musl-libc.org/compatibility.html\r\nFAQ: https://www.musl-libc.org/faq.html\r\n\r\nPerhaps being able to build fully-static Bitcoin Core binaries is a worthwhile features, as I've heard that glibc supports static builds in theory, but has many quirks in practice.",

          "body": "This replaces `boost::shared_mutex` and `boost::unique_lock` with [`std::shared_mutex`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/shared_mutex) & [`std::unique_lock`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/unique_lock).\r\n\r\nEven though [some concerns were raised](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16684#issuecomment-726214696) in #16684 with regard to `std::shared_mutex` being unsafe to use across some glibc versions, I still think this change is an improvement. As I mentioned in #21022, I also think trying to restrict standard library feature usage based on bugs in glibc is not only hard to do, but it's not currently clear exactly how we do that in practice (does it also extend to patching out use in our dependencies, should we be implementing more runtime checks for features we are using, when do we consider an affected glibc \"old enough\" not to worry about? etc). If you take a look through the [glibc bug tracker](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/describecomponents.cgi?product=glibc) you'll no doubt find plenty of (active) bug reports for standard library code we already using. Obviously not to say we shouldn't try and avoid buggy code where possible.\r\n\r\nTwo other points:\r\n\r\n[Cory mentioned in #21022](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21022#issuecomment-769274179):\r\n> It also seems reasonable to me to worry that boost hits the same underlying glibc bug, and we've just not happened to trigger the right conditions yet.\r\n\r\nMoving away from Boost to the standard library also removes the potential for differences related to Boosts configuration. Boost has multiple versions of `shared_mutex`, and what you end up using, and what it's backed by depends on:\r\n* The version of Boost.\r\n* The platform you're building for.\r\n* Which version of `BOOST_THREAD_VERSION` is defined: (2,3,4 or 5) default=2. (see [here](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/doc/html/thread/build.html#thread.build.configuration) for some of the differences).\r\n* Is `BOOST_THREAD_V2_SHARED_MUTEX` defined? (not by default). If so, you might get the [\"less performant, but more robust\"](https://github.com/boostorg/thread/issues/230#issuecomment-475937761) version of `shared_mutex`.\r\n\r\nA lot of these factors are eliminated by our use of depends, but users will have varying configurations. It's also not inconceivable to think that a distro, or some package manager might start defining something like `BOOST_THREAD_VERSION=3`. Boost tried to change the default from 2 to 3 at one point.\r\n\r\nWith this change, we no longer use Boost Thread, so this PR also removes it from depends, the build system, CI etc.\r\n\r\nPrevious similar PRs were #19183 & #20922. The authors are included in the commits here.\r\nAlso related to #21022 - pthread sanity checking.",

      "body": "> > Can't we get rid of it? That's resolve this particular issue at least (though not the wider discussion around glibc versions).\r\n\r\n> Without looking at the code (assuming it wouldn't require a redesign), this seems like a reasonable temporary punt. \r\n\r\nI think this is actually very reasonable. The shared_mutex in the sigcache was introduced in ef0f422519de4a3ce47d923e5f8f90cd12349f3e. @sipa's commit log:\r\n\r\n>     Remove contention on signature cache during block validation\r\n>    \r\n>     Since block validation happens in parallel, multiple threads may be\r\n>     accessing the signature cache simultaneously. To prevent contention:\r\n>     * Turn the signature cache lock into a shared mutex\r\n>     * Make reading from the cache only acquire a shared lock\r\n>     * Let block validations not store their results in the cache\r\n\r\nI believe that since #10192 was merged, block validation will now very rarely use the signature cache. From that PR:\r\n\r\n> This is somewhat duplicative with the sigcache, as entries in the\r\n> new cache will also have several entries in the sigcache. However,\r\n> the sigcache is kept both as ATMP relies on it and because it\r\n> prevents malleability-based DoS attacks on the new higher-level\r\n> cache. Instead, the -sigcachesize option is re-used - cutting the\r\n> sigcache size in half and using the newly freed memory for the\r\n> script execution cache.\r\n\r\nIf the only use for sigcache is now in ATMP (which is single-threaded and requires cs_main), then changing this to a simple mutex wouldn't have any impact on performance. I don't understand the \"prevents malleability-based DoS attacks on the new higher-level cache\" part of @TheBlueMatt's description so I may be missing something subtle here.",
