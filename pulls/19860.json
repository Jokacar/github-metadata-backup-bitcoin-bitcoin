    "body": "This PR improves the logic around netgroup diversity of new connections. More specifically, it improves privacy and fixes a couple things I consider buggy. It also adds a bunch of documentation. \r\n\r\nThis PR changes the following:\r\n1. prevents short-lived ADDR_FETCH and FEELER connections from affecting our further peer selection, because they are short-lived and should not matter\r\n2. ~~ADDR_FETCH and FEELER conns are now not included in `count_failure` consideration (see new documentation). Even though it *makes sense* to consider them if they are present at the moment of the call, we should not rely on that luck. Instead, we should be explicit.~~\r\n3. ~Prevents BLOCK_RELAY connections from affecting our further full-relay peer selection, because otherwise, an attacker with sufficient ADDR-related capabilities may infer to which netgroups those (supposedly more private) connections belong.~ Abandoning this feature for now because the trade-offs are unclear, see P2P meeting at #bitcoin-core-dev from Sept. 8.\r\n4. Look at the existing MANUAL peers when enforcing diversity of new outbound conns.\r\n\r\n~I’m also not sure whether *new* BLOCK_RELAY connections should be distinct w.r.t *existent* full outbound connections. Seems like another influence vector for an attacker with AddrMan poisoning capabilities, but this threat is probably too advanced. And having a good diversity of BLOCK_RELAY conns is very beneficial.~",

If many of our peers are Sybils, it also would improve the chance of not connecting to the same netgroup.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to the work in this PR, I think we better select them as diverse as we can.

On the face of it, it seems strange to me make this kind of peering behavior dependent of the order in which we connect peers (full-relay first or block-relay first), and in particular, my presumption would be that it's more important to aim for peer netgroup diversity (as a first-order solution to being eclipsed) than it is to worry about inference based on that diversity (which is a second-order concern with regards to eclipse attacks) -- but if the inference capability is strong then perhaps I'm mistaken in thinking that?",

          "body": "`fGetAddr` is an old flag that indicates an ongoing GETADDR/ADDR interaction. Introduced in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/dd519206a684c772a4a06ceecc87c665ad09d8be, it prevents further relay of received ADDR answers to other peers via the `RelayAddress()` gossip mechanism while set - probably to prevent ADDR traffic from being dominated by large GETADDR answers. \r\n\r\nIt also used to be possible to receive a large GETADDR answer spread over multiple ADDR messages (each bounded to max 1000 addresses), so the condition `if (vAddr.size() < 1000) pfrom.fGetAddr = false;` was meant to ensure that `fGetAddr` would only get cleared once the last ADDR of the package was received (typically with < 1000 addresses).\r\n\r\nHowever, `fGetAddr` currently does not work as originally intended and is no longer useful:\r\n- typically, the first ADDR we receive from a peer after sending the GETADDR is not the GETADDR response but the self-announcement of our peer. If this is the case, `fGetAddr` acts on it (preventing its relay) and is already inactivated once the GETADDR response is received.\r\n-  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/5cbf75324d1509a1262b65c5073314a4da3f6d77 introduced the condition `vAddr.size() <= 10`, so messages with more than 10 elements won't be relayed further regardless.\r\n- since #5419, we do not get more than one ADDR message in response to GETADDR because `vAddrToSend` cannot have more than 1000 elements. \r\n\r\nRemoving the flag will cause initial self-announcement from outbound peers to be gossip-relayed.\r\n\r\nThanks to jnewbery for help with reconstructing the history of `fGetAddr`!\r\n\r\n**[Outdated, but left in for context]**\r\nRemoving the flag will change behaviour in two special cases:\r\n1.) If the GETADDR response is exactly of size 1000, `fGetAddr` will not not be cleared on current master, so that the next \"regular\" ADDR message by this peer won't be relayed - this does not seem intentional, changing it arguably fixes a bug.\r\n2.) If the response to GETADDR is small  (<=10 addresses), it will be relayed to peers just as any other ADDR message of that size.",

          "body": "### Background\r\n\r\nThe primary method of relaying node addresses across the network is daily self-announcement and forwarding self-announcements of other nodes.\r\nTo rate-limit those, we relay them only to 1 or 2 peers (depending on whether the address is reachable for us).\r\nUnfortunately, in current implementation there is a chance of choosing SPV nodes, which, to the best of my knowledge, currently do not forward those announcements.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nDuring the [meeting](http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2019-10-17.html) we reached a soft consensus that address relay participation should not be coupled to SPV/full node definition, but rather have an explicit flag (e.g. service flag).\r\nUntil that’s getting resolved, I’m suggesting a tiny patch that prevent forwarding (they still can request and learn) these announcements to SPV nodes.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nTo justify the change, I decided to measure how does this relay perform in different conditions (see my [script](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bitcoin_network_analysis/blob/master/addr_relay/forward_to_spv.py)).\r\nI measured how many nodes know about the new address relayed through this protocol (omitting batching <10 rule) within 120 “waves” of relay, each happening every 30 seconds (which is roughly 1 hour).\r\n\r\nLet’s see what if the address is reachable to 5% of the network (I guess pretty fair assumption for Onion addresses, for example). Let's call those \"exotic\".\r\nLet's also simulate having 10% of black holes, which are indistinguishable from real nodes, but don't forward anything.\r\n\r\n|  non-forwarding SPV nodes                                   | 5%  | 10%  | 20%  | 30% |\r\n|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n| All nodes knowing addr (before the change) | 56% | 48% | 30% | 22% |\r\n| All nodes knowing addr (after the change)  | 55% | 54% | 58%  | 40% |\r\n|  |\r\n| Exotic nodes knowing addr (before the change) | 80% | 75% | 55% | 50% |\r\n| Exotic nodes knowing addr (after the change)  | 76% | 77% | 75%  | 75% |\r\n\r\nIf you don't believe it's that bad, please make your own simulation to validate mine :)\r\n\r\nIt will become worse and worse with the growth of SPV.\r\n\r\nThese numbers can also be used to motivate the high-level change (see [discussion](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-October/017428.html)).\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n1. Would we make SPVs more vulnerable to addrman injections? Like, would it be easier for an attacker to fill their addrmans with malicious sybil nodes? (I guess we are already vulnerable it assuming some capabilities of an attacker, but would it be noticeably worse? EthanHeilman)\r\n2. Does the same apply to the old pruned nodes? (achow101 I think you mentioned that older nodes would also be excluded here). Should we forward these announcements to them, if this makes them noticeably more vulnerable?\r\n\r\nWe can forward it to these two groups IN ADDITION to forwarding to (1 or 2) peers, if there is a belief that this is might affect their security. The bandwidth overhead would be obviously very low.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### P.S.\r\n~~This experiment also means that we're very vulnerable to just black holes when relaying exotic addresses, but I will write about it in a separate issue.~~\r\nImrpoved the script to consider black holes.\r\n\r\n#### P.P.S.\r\n~~I guess the biggest inaccuracy in my little experiment is that in practice, those exotic semi-reachable nodes are well-interconnected, so once the address makes it to one of those — it should be relayed a bit better. Maybe, I will try to measure.\r\nAnyway, this does not disregard the problem.~~\r\nImproved the script to take exotic inter-connectivity into account and updated the measurements.",

      "body": "@sdaftuar I agree that immediate diversity is more important than theoretical anti-inference. But since it's easy to get confused here, I want to point out that after the second commit:\r\n- *new* block relay conns are made with full diversity, same as before\r\n- *new* full relay conns are made distinct w.r.t. existing full relay conns\r\n\r\nThe difference is only that *existing* block relay conns don't affect *new* full relay conns.\r\n\r\nSo, like, just 2 of the existing peers, for now, won't participate in diversity enforcement. If we have more (say 8 block relay conns), we might introduce some randomness: like 4 conns are used to diversify new full conns, and 4 are hidden.\r\n\r\n>Do you have a way to model what an attacker's capability would need to be in order to deduce something like this?\r\n\r\nNo, not right now. I just assume an attacker can influence what our AddrMan has. The influence shouldn't even be that strong, they just have to force us to connect to a set of (given by them) peers on-demand with some probability.\r\n\r\nFor example, they exploited eviction and made us connect to them (via regular conns) exclusively. Now to eclipse us they have to find out about our block-relay-only conns and potentially disrupt those. May be feasible with these capabilities and enough protocol knowledge :)\r\nSince block-relay-only conns are created (sort of) specifically to handle scenarios like this, I wanna make them more robust.\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nIf this is not convincing, I can drop the commit until when/if I can actually demostrate a feasible attack.\r\n",

      "body": "I think you have don't consider not only AddrMan poisoning capabilities but also more powerful ones like connections-interference capabilities. E.g an adversary observing an outbound connection from Alice to Bob and repeatedly opening inbound towards Bob until Alice is dropped. More concretely, if we assume that an attacker can map a victim outbound full-relay peers through tx-relay and manipulate those connections liveliness, a serie of which netgroups have been visited can be established. Observing the missing ones among the publicly available peerspace should hint attacker towards which netgroups are occupied by victim's block-relay slots.\r\n\r\nI understand this PR as aiming to provoke netgroup collisions among the set of full-relay and block-relay peers to avoid making observable the absence of it. And thus improving the non-observability of block-relay peers. Of course it has as a side-effect to decrease the global outbound peers diversity as full-relay netgroups may overlap with block-relay ones. I think this is acceptable as the diversity reduction come at the win of making it far harder to disrupt block-relay connections. Previously an attacker should have committed a higher number Sybils spread in more diverse netgroups and could have interfered with victim's honest block-relay to increase odds of its deployed Sybils being selected as block-relay. Now, an attacker may commit a lower number of Sybils spread in a less diverse netgroups but is more restrained to interfere, and thus likely decrease its odds of being selected.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think diversity and network topology non-observability are improving eclipse-attack resistance on different axis. As of today, the current trade-off we have between them is more due to the absence of clean separation between block-relay/tx-relay and a low number of block-relay-only.\r\n\r\nConcept ACK",

The remaining commits make `CAddrMan::m_asmap` usage safer:\r\n\r\n- don't reach into `CAddrMan`'s internal data from `CConnMan`\r\n- set `m_asmap` in the initializer list and make it const\r\n- make `m_asmap` private, and access it (as a reference to const) from a getter.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that peers.dat deserialization must happen after setting m_asmap, since m_asmap is set during CAddrMan construction.",

This is initialized at startup, and the client components addrman and connman simply call `NetGroupManager::GetGroup(const CAddress&)` and `NetGroupManager::GetMappedAS(const CAddress&)` to get the net group and AS of an address.",

          "body": "This implements the suggestion from #23763 to introduce an option to establish block-relay-connections manually with the `-addnode` RPC.\r\nAdding these can make sense for a node operator that wants to be connected to a anonymity networks like Tor or I2P, but also wants to have additional protection against eclipse attacks: Following the best chain can be more of an issue on anonymity networks because these are smaller and it can be easier to create a lot of sybil nodes there.\r\n\r\nIn that situation, manual block-relay-only connections to peers on clearnet networks can help us staying connected to the best chain, but in contrast to normal manual connections, transactions and addresses aren't transmitted on these links - in particular not our own address or transaction from our wallet. This increases privacy and will also make it harder to perform fingerprinting attacks (connecting our identities over different networks).\r\n\r\nManual Block-Relay connections:\r\n- can be specified with `-addnode` RPC, both with the `add` and `onetry` command\r\n- can be specified with the `-addnode` bitcoind arg (or in bitcoin.conf) with `<IP>=manual-block-relay`\r\n- don't participate in transaction and address relay\r\n- don't get discouraged / punished for misbehavior (but will still get disconnected for sending TX/tx-INV as automatic block-relay-only peers do)\r\n- are not subject to outbound eviction logic (unlike automatic block-relay-only-peers)\r\n",

          "body": "As per https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25560, I suggested that new maintainers should be added with a call for maintainer process as outlined below.\r\n\r\n> \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)  by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\r\n if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\r\n role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\r\n maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\r\n relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\r\n\r\nThe doc has not been adopted. However, bitcoin is a permissionless project, so I am opening a C4M that is just of my own personal initiative.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Do we need a new scoped maintainer?\r\n\r\nFrom IRC on August 12th, 2022, where @laanwj also stepped down:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<bytes1440000> I see a need for \"janitorial maintainer\" who understands the importance of privacy in core and privacy of contributors. Since #25560 is still open and intent of reviewers doesn't look they want to improve anything in the process, there is no \"call for maintainers\" thing.\r\n<bytes1440000> I would prefer someone who has already contributed to bitcoin privacy and privacy in general, not living in first world countries and not funded by brink.\r\n<vasild> #proposedmeetingtopic vasild for a new maintainer with a focus on P2P/networking \r\n<vasild> I volunteer, if there is a perceived need for that.\r\n<bytes1440000> vasild: thanks for volunteering and i think you are the best candidate for p2p/privacy. I wish we had one for mempool/privacy and wallet/privacy as well.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Today's IRC Meeting, August 18th 2022. For the sake of the new process, please consider that ACKs here are ACKs on the person but are included here as demonstrating ACKs on the need for such a new maintainer & the role. Note also that vasild is not explicitly stating privacy, as bytes1440000 requested initially, which has been clarified below in this discussion to be out-of-scope for this proposed maintainer. (Please see the complete logs for all discussion, this is not a full excerpy).\r\n\r\n```\r\n<vasild_> Two maintainers stepped down recently (sipa and laanwj) and there is no dedicated maintainer for P2P/networking. So I step in coz I think I can help the project in that way. That's it.\r\n<laanwj> i think it would make some sense, you've been the most active in P2P development for quite a while\r\n<jarolrod> concept ack, i think vasild_ is very qualified for such a role. And has contributed important changes to the p2p code. He also has done extensive reviews, and catching issues others don't catch\r\n<michaelfolkson> +1\r\n<hebasto> concept ack\r\n<achow101> ack\r\n<lightlike> ack vasild\r\n<jonatack> a thought: the past few years vasild, laanwj, and myself have been working on or reviewing a large-ish chunk of net code that few others have been. i believe sipa knows the code well, too, along with (maybe) a couple others. laanwj has been merging these changes. so it makes sense to me that one of these would maintain.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Relevant Evamples of PRs such a maintainer might focus on\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25421\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25717\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25688\r\n\r\nwhich includes things that impact privacy in P2P\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19860\r\n\r\nBut does not include non P2P/Networking Privacy code like:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23372\r\n\r\n## Nominees\r\n\r\nI will keep this synced with nominees from the below thread / other maintainers feel free to edit to keep synchronized.
