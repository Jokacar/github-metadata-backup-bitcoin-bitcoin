I think that this existing separation should work well, the problem that this PR fixes is that `FindNextBlocksToDownload` would pick historical blocks from the background chain when it shouldn't because higher-prio blocks are available.",

Then we have capacity for this peer left and would actually ask for the historical blocks via `TryDownloadingHistoricalBlocks()`.\r\n\r\nSo I think what would actually happen on mainnet and signet is that each time we can process a block request with an existing peer, we'd move `pindexLastCommonBlock` 1024 blocks ahead, and then request historical blocks - until `pindexLastCommonBlock` has reached the snapshot. So we'd continuing downloading the background chain for a while (a few minutes?) with existing peers until we switch over to the snapshot chain (instead of never switching over as I originally thought when opening this PR).\r\n\r\nStill, I think that this behavior is not great, and the fix is an improvement - not only because we start downloading the snapshot chain immediately, we also do much less iterating in `FindNextBlocksToDownload` , moving `pindexLastCommonBlock` ahead without actually downloading anything.\r\n",

And if the peer's best block is more than `BLOCK_DOWNLOAD_WINDOW` blocks away from the current chain, the node will never be able to download enough blocks to reach it and validate it.

I'd say that in this hypothetical situation, AssumeUtxo is not at the top of the list of our concerns - bitcoin would have far bigger problems.\r\n\r\nWithout a massive reorg, there is the alternative that the snapshot provided was bad somehow. But then (apart from the fact that it shouldn't have been hardcoded into chainparams), it also shouldn't have been loaded in the first place because its header should not have been accepted to our block index with our header DoS protections.\r\n\r\nSo all in all I think that once we've accepted a snapshot, we've made a commitment and have to treat it as part of the best chain, at least until background sync has finished.",

      "body": "re: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29519#discussion_r1635456871\r\n\r\nGood points. My suggested change was premised on the false assumption that the node would be able to seamlessly reorg to the most-work chain. But that's not true because of missing undo data.\r\n\r\nYour philosophical point is interesting. I believe that:\r\n\r\n- Loading snapshots should not affect how nodes come to consensus, it should only affect what order they download blocks, and help them compute the latest UTXO sets sooner.\r\n\r\nAnd you seem to be suggesting:\r\n\r\n- Loading a snapshot should force a node to only consider chains that include the snapshot block and ignore other chains, even if they have more work.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn this PR more specifically:\r\n\r\nWhen I made my suggested change, I was forgetting that we don't have any undo data for the snapshot block and blocks before it, so unfortunately it is not possible for a node to follow the most-work chain when a snapshot is loaded until all the preceding blocks are downloaded.\r\n\r\nGiven this fact, I think the best thing FindNextBlocksToDownload can do when an unvalidated snapshot is loaded is to ignore peers on other chains not containing the snapshot block, until it actually has the blocks and undo data that would be needed to validate other chains. I think the current PR is not exactly doing this though. It looks like it will still download up to BLOCK_DOWNLOAD_WINDOW useless blocks on the peer's chain, starting at the fork point between the two chains, which is not great. It will also _not_  download later blocks after snapshot is validated, when undo data needed to enable a re-org becomes available.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn the broader approach to downloading blocks when a snapshot is loaded:\r\n\r\nI'd agree now that the only sensible block downloading behavior for an unvalidated snapshot chainstate is to only download blocks after the snapshot (due to lack of undo data before then) and ignore any peers whose best blocks don't descend from the snapshot block.\r\n\r\nBut it is less clear which blocks should be downloaded and attached to the older chainstate, and whether it should target the most-work block or the snapshot block. Since d43a1f1a2fa35d377c7a9ad7ab92d1ae325bde3d from #27746 it targets the snapshot block, but was not doing that originally. Comparing the two alternatives:\r\n\r\n- Targeting the most-work block seems like a purer approach that would probably simplify the code and remove special cases, and would also have the benefit of the node syncing to the most-work chain faster, with less wasted work if it the chain turns out to be valid.\r\n  \r\n- Targeting the snapshot block is also very reasonable, and is what the code is doing currently, and guarantees the snapshot will be validated even if it is not used, and could be a practical defense against eclipse attacks, or fork chains that appear to have more work but turn out to be invalid.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn whether we should care about any of this:\r\n\r\nI don't think we need to care about these design choices too much, since everything above is referring to a case we don't expect to encounter, where there is a possibly-valid chain of blocks, not including the snapshot block, that has more work than any known chain including the snapshot block. The only time when we should see this is when there is a major fork with a lot of work behind it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think \"the premise that we could get into this situation should be rejected.\" That seems like it is going too far. We should put some thought into how code will behavior in presence for forks for practical reasons, and also to inform design of the code and to write it in a clean way that isn't full of assumptions and special cases.\r\n\r\nI do think, as long as we are hardcoding snapshot hashes in the source code, we can reject premise that snapshot chainstate turns out to be invalid, and just refuse to run in that case. But the case where the snapshot is valid, but the snapshot block is not on the most-work chain seems different and worth thinking about.",

Tighten the criteria for snapshot acceptance: We could reject loading the snapshot if the snapshot block is not a predecessor of `m_best_header`.
