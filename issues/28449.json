    "title": "guix: prune Rust toolchain boostrap from Darwin HOSTS",
    "body": "We once-again have a Rust toolchain bootstrap as part of our Darwin Guix builds. While not necessarily bad, this consumes a fairly significant amount of additional time / resources when bootstrapping, and may make it harder to bootstrap on some platforms. It's probably inevitable that we'll have to bootstrap a Rust toolchain in future (for all HOSTS) whenever Rust becomes a dependency of a more core utility or library, but for now, if it's easy to do, we could prune it out.\r\n\r\nThe chain to Rust is:\r\n\r\n`python-signapple -> python-requests -> python-urllib3 -> python-cryptography -> python-cryptography-rust`.\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution here might just be to change signapple to not use `python-requests` for it's timestamping POST:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/achow101/signapple/blob/48ba6fe3f92ca9e035c5056126524aaea4bfacb0/signapple/sign.py#L267\r\n\r\nand use the Python standard library: https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request instead.",
