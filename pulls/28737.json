          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [ ] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick)\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add mempool transactions in a topologically-invalid way.\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts.

          "body": "Motivation\r\n* It seems preferable to use stdlib data structures instead of boost if they can achieve close to the same thing.\r\n* Code external to mempool should ideally use its public helper methods instead of accessing `mapTx` directly.\r\n* Reduce the number of complex boost multi index type interactions\r\n* Also see #28335 for further context/motivation. This PR together with #28385 simplifies that one.\r\n\r\nOverview of things done in this PR:\r\n* Make `vTxHashes` a vector of transaction references instead of a pair of transaction hash and iterator. The trade off here is that the iterator is retrieved on the fly with `get_iter_from_wtxid` instead of being cached in `vTxHashes`.\r\n* Replace `mapTx` access with `CTxMemPool` helper methods\r\n  * Please note when reviewing that `infoAll` is already in other places that grab all mempool transactions as well, such as in net_processing when responding to bip35 messages.\r\n* Simplify `checkChainLimits` call in `node/interfaces.cpp`\r\n* Make `MiniMinerMempoolEntry` ctor more explicit\r\n* Make `CTxMemPoolEntry`s `lockPoints`mutable such that they can be changed with a const iterator directly instead of going through `mapTx`\r\n* Make `BlockAssembler`'s `inBlock` and `failedTx` sets of transaction hashes.",

          "title": "RFC: Remove boost usage from kernel api / headers",
          "body": "Similarly to #28327 I wanted to open this PR to receive some opinions and better approaches.\r\n\r\nThe kernel library is currently at the stage where unwanted headers are removed from its set of headers. In practice, this means we are reducing the number of includes that are required for compiling the experimental `bitcoin-chainstate` binary. This is described in stage 1 step 3 of the [project tracking issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).\r\n\r\nCurrently the mempool is part of the kernel library. The mempool headers include the boost multi index headers. Thus any application wanting to use the kernel library and its headers will have to include the boost headers too. This is not only undesirable because of the sheer size of these headers, but also might lead to conflicts if the including application uses a different boost version.\r\n\r\nIn the approach laid out by this PR, mempool member variables and methods are declared in the header without having to include boost by either wrapping them in a struct and [pimpling](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl) them, or making methods static implementation functions. The boost definitions are gathered into separate header (`mempool_set_definitions.h`) that is only included by implementation files that require definitions of the boost types. This allows us to retain the current architecture with roughly the same interfaces. \r\n\r\nThe approach laid out by this PR also has some, albeit small, compilation speed and size benefits. Averaged over a few of compilation runs I consistently observe faster compilation by a couple of seconds and some smaller pre-processed and compiled object sizes. The main detractor of this method is obviously the number of lines touched. However it also has the benefit of inventorizing all the files that require direct access to the mempool data structures as well getting rid of boost multi index includes in non-kernel implementation files that include the mempool, but don't directly manipulate its data structures (e.g. wallet.cpp).\r\n\r\nA much simpler alternative approach, at least on the surface, would be removing all `txmempool.h` includes from kernel library headers (see [this branch](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/mempoolBoostSimple)). Currently this is only `validation.h`.  Due to the mutex member of `CTxMemPool` and the correspondingly defined lock decorators on the chainstate methods this becomes a bit more complicated though and I am not sure how this might be possible with the current architecture.\r\n\r\nA discussion of how and if to remove the mempool from the kernel library has so far been intentionally punted to the next stage of the kernel library development. Pimpling the mempool itself precludes this discussion, since the library could never be shipped with the `CTxMemPool` headers. Pimpling the mempool members (like done in this PR) might also make a future splitting of block and mempool validation logic into separate compilation units easier.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on #28391 which simplifies some of the required refactors.",
