Delete the data directory.\n2. Launch `bitcoin-qt --server`.\n3. Immediately check the chain state with `bitcoin-qt getblockchaininfo`.\n\nThe RPC server doesn't have enough time to initialize, so the call to port 8333 fails.\n\nFixed the issue by using the rpcwait option:\n`bitcoin-cli --rpcwait getblockchaininfo`\n",
