    "body": "Currently the Windows CI doesn't run the functional tests, see #18623 and fa50d11dd117eb6f91cbeac7476797f3885a6169\r\n\r\nAlso, it has been quite slow. On Linux a build with ccache finishes in a few minutes. On Windows it takes almost an hour, even with clcache. clcache apparently had no effect on the build time and has been removed in #18640 \r\n\r\nIf someone has background in Windows build systems, they could help us speed up the build or even enable the functional tests again.\r\n\r\nMaybe the issue is with appveyor, so an option could be to port the appveyor yaml to travis or cirrus ci and see if that fixes the problem.\r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\nExperience with Windows powershell and Windows build systems\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this. You are encouraged to comment on the issue if you are planning to work on it. This will help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed and is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",

There are multiple things that would be nice and I think some of these probably have a higher priority than coverage reports:\r\n\r\n - ARM tests https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/598\r\n - Big-endian tests https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/696\r\n - Windows and/or MSVC builds? (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/451#issuecomment-746752833)\r\n - MacOS builds? (MacOS relies on clang anyway, so not this is not as interesting as MSVC.)\r\n - Coverage reports #705 \r\n - Reducing configuration options to keep the test matrix manageable, see e.g., https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/596#issuecomment-495908309\r\n\r\nIs there anything else you would like to see?\r\n\r\nIf we want to work on this, this is a good time to think about the CI platform. I don't mind Travis and it's reasonably stable in the past months but if we think that a different (or additional) provider is a better fit, it's better to discuss this before we start working on these issues.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Bitcoin is currently looking into GitHub Actions for Windows at least:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17803\r\n",
