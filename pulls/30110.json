    "body": "Part of #27463.\r\n\r\nDraft while #30000 is not merged, and because I am still smoothing out the interface, making sure the commits are clean, and writing more tests.\r\n\r\nThis modularizes transaction download logic into a `TxDownloadManager`. Transaction download logic refers to the process of deciding what transactions to request, download, and validate.[1]\r\nAll of the changes here should result in no behavior change.\r\n\r\nThere are several benefits to this interface, such as:\r\n- Unit test coverage and **F U Z Z I N G** for logic that currently isn't feasible to test as thoroughly (due to the code paths not being reachable through `PeerManager` without a ton of overhead) and/or currently only lightly tested through `assert_debug_log` ( :-1: ) in functional tests.\r\n    - See for example the `MempoolRejectedTx` test, where we can define a matrix of expected outcomes for each `TxValidationResult` and test them very easily.\r\n    - For fuzzing, see the `txdownloadman` and `txdownload_impl` targets.\r\n- When we add more functionality (e.g. package relay messages, more robust orphan handling), the vast majority of it will be within `TxDownloadManager` instead of `PeerManager`, making it easier to review and test.\r\n- A thinner and easier-to-use interface for `PeerManager`, which will no longer know anything about / have access to `TxOrphanage` or rejection caches. Its primary interface with `TxDownloadManager` would be:\r\n    - Notify `txdownloadman` of tip changes (i.e. passing on some `ValidationInterface` callbacks)\r\n    - Tell `txdownloadman`when a {transaction, package} is {accepted, rejected} from mempool, and receive a few instructions\r\n    - Each time a peer connects or disconnects + sanity check functions during cleanup\r\n    - Pass transaction `inv`s, `notfound`s to `txdownloadman` and receive instructions on what to validate\r\n    - Get the `getdata` requests to send\r\n    - Get the transactions to reconsider in `ProcessOrphanTx`\r\n    - Get whether a peer `HaveMoreWork` for the `ProessMessages` loop\r\n    - ^note that there are some cleanups I still have to do, so it's not this clean yet, but this is the vision. For example, while I'm writing this, I plan to make `Find1P1CPackage` private to `TxDownloadImpl`\r\n    - ^in the future, it would also pass package-related messages on, and we would reuse the `PackageToValidate` struct to return the things `peerman` needs for validation.\r\n- (todo) with some more interface changes, we can make this manager internally thread-safe instead of having `PeerManager` handle it (e.g. currently it locks `cs_main` to synchronize accesses to `m_txrequest`!)\r\n\r\n[1]: This does not include transaction announcements, i.e. what we *send* to our peers. All of that happens after we download/accept a tx. Txreconciliation (erlay) is excluded from this module, as it is part of announcements and/or part of helping the other peer decide which `inv`s to send.",

          "body": "See #27463 for full project tracking.\r\n\r\nThis contains the first few commits of #30110, which require some thinking about thread safety in review.\r\n- Introduce a new `m_tx_download_mutex` which guards the transaction download data structures including `m_txrequest`, the rolling bloom filters, and `m_orphanage`. Later this should become the mutex guarding `TxDownloadManager`.\r\n  - `m_txrequest` doesn't need to be guarded using `cs_main` anymore\r\n  - `m_recent_confirmed_transactions` doesn't need its own lock anymore\r\n  - `m_orphanage` doesn't need its own lock anymore\r\n- Adds a new `ValidationInterface` event, `UpdatedBlockTipSync`, which is a synchronous version of `UpdatedBlockTip`.\r\n- Flush `m_recent_rejects` and `m_recent_rejects_reconsiderable` on `UpdatedBlockTipSync` just once instead of every time `AlreadyHaveTx` is called. This should speed up calls to that function and removes the need to lock `cs_main` every time it is called.\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n- These data structures need synchronization (for example, something that goes into the `m_orphanage` should not be added to `m_txrequest`. In the future, orphan resolution tracking should also be synchronized. Currently, `cs_main` is used to e.g. sync accesses to `m_txrequest`. We should not broaden the scope of things it locks.\r\n- Currently, we need to know the current chainstate every time we call `AlreadyHaveTx` so we can decide whether we should update it. Every call compares the current tip hash with `hashRecentRejectsChainTip`. It is more efficient to have a validation interface callback that updates the rejection filters whenever the chain tip changes.",

          "body": "Part of #27463 in the \"make orphan handling more robust\" section.\r\n\r\nCurrently the main map in `TxOrphanage` is indexed by txid; we do not allow 2 transactions with the same txid into TxOrphanage. This means that if we receive a transaction and want to store it in orphanage, we'll fail to do so if a same-txid-different-witness version of the tx already exists in the orphanage. The existing orphanage entry can stay until it expires 20 minutes later, or until we find that it is invalid.\r\n\r\nThis means an attacker can try to block/delay us accepting an orphan transaction by sending a mutated version of the child ahead of time. See included test.\r\n\r\nPrior to #28970, we don't rely on the orphanage for anything and it would be relatively difficult to guess what transaction will go to a node's orphanage. After the parent(s) are accepted, if anybody sends us the correct transaction, we'll end up accepting it. However, this is a bit more painful for 1p1c: it's easier for an attacker to tell when a tx is going to hit a node's orphanage, and we need to store the correct orphan + receive the parent before we'll consider the package. If we start out with a bad orphan, we can't evict it until we receive the parent + try the 1p1c, and then we'll need to download the real child, put it in orphanage, download the parent again, and then retry 1p1c.",

This is to prevent using `m_k0` for something it is not intended to, given what data we feed to the randomizer should not matter\r\n- `destinations/target` has been renamed to `n` in `ShouldFanoutTo/IsFanoutTarget` \r\n- The PR has been rebased \r\n\r\nAlso, the following things have been added/changed to the approach:\r\n- Deal with short id collisions by fanning out both transactions\r\n- Deal with ancestors being present on the mempool when a children needs to be placed in the fanout or reconciliation sets (as opposed to deal with parents, which was the wrong approach)\r\n- Move fanout/reconcile logic from from INV creation to `RelayTransaction`\r\n\r\nThe differences can be easily checked via `git range-diff a14dfd9c873d1e196252c77ad7a8b32bd21b6f6d...ac5dc0aa512e78a1cc90e0ab182eedaec68b0444`\r\n\r\nErlay Project Tracking: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28646",

As a result, this simplifies the `kernel::Notifications` interface.\r\n- removes warnings.cpp from the kernel library\r\n- removes warning globals\r\n- adds testing for the warning logic\r\n\r\nBehaviour change introduced:\r\n- the `-alertnotify` command is executed for all `KernelNotifications::warningSet` calls, which now also covers the `LARGE_WORK_INVALID_CHAIN` warning\r\n- the GUI is updated automatically whenever a warning is (un)set, covering some code paths where it previously wouldn't be, e.g. when `node::AbortNode()` is called, or for the `LARGE_WORK_INVALID_CHAIN` warning\r\n\r\nSome discussion points:\r\n- ~is `const std::string& id` the best way to refer to warnings? Enums are an obvious alternative, but since we need to define warnings across libraries, strings seem like a straightforward solution.~ _edit: updated approach to use `node::Warning` and `kernel::Warning` enums._",

          "title": "Broadcast own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections",
          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNext step after this PR is done will be to have the wallet do the private broadcast as well, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11887 would have to be resolved.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

          "body": "This PR adds `last_block_announcement` to the per-peer `getpeerinfo` RPC result. This is the most recent time that this peer was the first to notify our node of a new block (one that we didn't already know about), or zero if this peer has never been the first to notify us of a new block. This timestamp already exists internally and is used for stale-tip eviction logic; this PR exposes it at the RPC layer.\r\n\r\nThis PR started out as a suggestion for additional test coverage, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26172#issuecomment-1259678260. It turned out that the easiest way to test (already-merged) #26172 is to add this field to `getpeerinfo` and have a functional test verify its value. But it may also be useful to have this result in its own right, similar to that RPC's existing `last_block` field -- it indicates something about the quality of our peers. It allows one to predict which peer will be evicted when the stale tip logic activates. (I'm not sure if that would be useful, but it may be.)\r\n\r\nThe functional test added here fails without #26172, which is the main goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not test the actual stale-tip eviction logic; that's difficult to do with a functional test. But it does test the correctness of the timestamp that the eviction logic depends on. #23352 is an attempt to test the eviction logic using a unit test, it's not ready to be merged yet. I think having both kinds of tests would be beneficial.",

          "body": "This PR contains the first part of #28608, which tries to make assumeutxo code more maintainable, and improve it by not locking `cs_main` for a long time when the snapshot block is connected, and by deleting the snapshot validation chainstate when it is no longer used, instead of waiting until the next restart.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR are just refactoring. They make `Chainstate` objects self-contained, so for example, it is possible to determine what blocks to connect to a chainstate without querying `ChainstateManager`, and to determine whether a Chainstate is validated without basing it on inferences like `&cs != &ActiveChainstate()` or `GetAll().size() == 1`.\r\n\r\nThe PR also tries to make assumeutxo terminology less confusing, using \"current chainstate\" to refer to the chainstate targeting the current network tip, and \"historical chainstate\" to refer to the chainstate downloading old blocks and validating the assumeutxo snapshot. It removes uses of the terms \"active chainstate,\" \"usable chainstate,\" \"disabled chainstate,\" \"ibd chainstate,\" and \"snapshot chainstate\" which are confusing for various reasons.",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [x] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick). [DONE, see [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/research-into-the-effects-of-a-cluster-size-limited-mempool-in-2023/794/1)]\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add duplicate transactions to the mempool (#29990).\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts.

For example, `TxDownloadOptions` could be extended to hold a lambda that returns the latest tip hash, which in production simply fetches the hash from the `ChainstateManager` (and for tests it can be mocked). This might be easier to review since it preserves the previous mechanism? Although perhaps also more difficult w.r.t to lock inversion of `cs_main` and `m_tx_download_mutex`.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative could be to directly pass the current block hash as a param into the relevant `TxDownloadManager` methods.",

      "body": "I don't think we'd ever need to make `TxDownloadManager` depend on `ChainstateManager` as we could just pass in the block hash, i.e.\r\n\r\n> Another alternative could be to directly pass the current block hash as a param into the relevant TxDownloadManager methods.\r\n\r\nThis would avoid the addition of `UpdateBlockTipSync` etc, as it's basically what we do now. I find this way of keeping synchronized with the chain tip pretty ugly - we'd need to hold `cs_main` and pass the blockhash to the `TxDownloadManager` all the time, bloating the interface. Subscribing to the validation interface and updating on every chain tip update seems much more sensible.",

And so net_processing.cpp no longer depends on txdownload_impl.h, which makes sense to me. Had to update `lint-circular-dependencies.py` but I do like that we can change txdownload_impl.h without recompiling everything. lmk if this seems better?",
