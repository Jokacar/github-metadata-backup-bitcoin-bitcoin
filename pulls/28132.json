Though probably only with a portion of their total hash power as I've only seen a few potential full-rbf replacements mined by them.\r\n\r\nThat's 37% (+ MARA Pool) of total hash power regularly mining full-rbf transactions.\r\n\r\nObviously, with this much support of full-rbf, arguments against it on the basis that unconfirmed transactions are safe are even more clearly invalid. Secondly, on the basis of mempool consistency with miners, since full-rbf is the compatible policy in almost all cases, we should be supporting it by default if you take the position that we want to optimize for consistency with miners. (CC: @achow101) Thirdly, all previous arguments in favor of full-rbf, such as multiparty transactions, wallets, user-expectations, etc. still apply.\r\n\r\nThis simplification of mempool policy is well overdue. Let's get this merged and this silly debate over with. Miners and node operators who choose to disable full-rbf still can with a simple configuration change.\r\n\r\n",

Previously the default was false/disabled. Users who update Bitcoin Core to a version containing this change would by default propagate and mine full-rbf replacements unless they had chosen to disable full-rbf.\r\n\r\nA significant fraction of the P2P network has already chosen to enable full-rbf, so full-rbf replacements propagate reasonably well. Almost half of pools by hash power has enabled full-rbf, so full-rbf replacements that reach those miners are readily mined, as seen on https://mempool.space/rbf#fullrbf and https://fullrbf.mempool.observer/",

      "body": "On the first line of arguments, I think zero-conf business acceptance have the option to deploy additional full-nodes with good transaction-relay peering to obtain a reasonable view of network mempools, and therefore increase their odds of seeing a double-spend of a confirmation of interest. In practice, zero-conf applications have risk threshold, once those thresholds are reached they will deactivate zero-conf acceptance.\r\n\r\nOn the second line or arguments, mempool consistency with miners is becoming a practical concern in my opinion with the appereance of so-called “transaction accelerators”, as now LSPs can use those out-of-band transaction-relay service to fee-bump their stuck multi-party transactions, and therefore provoke a divergence with the rest of the network. I raised this risk of [“mining income asymmetries due to unequal access in to transaction flows bypassing policies”](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26438#issuecomment-1299522242) in Suhas proposal to remove the mempoolfullrbf option months ago.\r\n\r\nOn the third line of arguments about the enhancement of multi-party funded transactions flows, the original motivation is explained in this [post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-May/003033.html) on the lightning dev mailing list. RBF opt-out allows a counterparty contributing an input to block the confirmation of a multi-party transaction at minimal cost, therefore enabling a liquidity griefing at low-cost (size of the pinning tx * mempool min fee).\r\n\r\nSince then, early Lightning Service Providers deploying dual-funding have raised again the [concern](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-May/003920.html) on the mailing list during May of this year, and how sustained RBF signaling flag opt-out can be an annoying vector of pinning attack. While from my understanding the issue might be solved on the Lightning-side by upcoming deployment of nversion=3 (where full-rbf is implied by the policy regime), this won’t solve the pinning issue for coinjoin multi-party transactions which are concerned too (and this is not sure that we’re deploying nversion=3 for the dual-funding/splicing flows due to package limits size). With that context in mind, full-rbf by default is a welcome deployment for second-layers and multi-party applications.\r\n\r\nOn the deployment schedule, we’re still mid-26.0 schedule, so I think it’s reasonable to land it now (feature freeze scheduled for 2023-10-01 as of today July 24th). This still gives a period of roughly 5 months to zero-conf business and other software that would need to tweak their software.\r\n\r\n37% of the hash power sounds a reasonable demonstration of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem selecting the transaction-relay policy favoring maximization of their mining income strategy.\r\n\r\nSo I’m Concept ACK on this change, I still think this change deserves announcement on the mailing list and usual technical communication channels to warn ecosystem stakeholders impacted by the proposed change.",

You opting out is meaningless once that has happened, because unconfirmed transactions are well and truly insecure.

My OTS calendars bump fees repeatedly, increasing the feerate by 1sat/vb with each replacement, starting at approximately the minimum relay fee. Every single one of those replacements is actually a long string of multiple replacements. mempool.space does not maintain replacement data beyond 24 hours or so; if you want to see live replacement data you can do to https://alice.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/ or https://bob.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/ and just click on any of the recently mined transactions to see mempool.space's replacement history data on them. You can also see full-rbf replacements at https://mempool.space/rbf#fullrbf, which I linked above as well.\r\n\r\nPlease delete your comment as it is factually incorrect and misleading. Frankly I'm surprised that you are so unaware of current mempool policies in use by miners that you were unaware of the fact that full-rbf has been widely adopted.",

I don't think that's just a fad at this point. However I'm inclined to wait a little bit longer, e.g. after the v26 release, to see if your observations are maintained and reproduced outside of OTS. The new mempool.space tracking is helpful here.\r\n\r\nIn the release notes we should remind wallet users to not (yet) stop using the RBF flag, because their peers may not reliably relay it.\r\n\r\n[0] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-July/021823.html",

This negative impact could be avoided by simply adding first seen safe rule - ie a trx can be replaced but needs to include the original outputs.\r\n> \r\n> At GAP600 we continue to see strong use of our service for BTC we have seen circa 350k unique trx hash per month (over the last 3 months) requested to our platform. Our clients include - Coinpayments, Coinspaid and Changelly. Given the period of Mempool being full we have seen an increase a fee required in order to be approved by our platform for trx. This is not an insignificant use case and one which can be easily maintained as is.\r\n> \r\n> We have provided further statistics in the past and direct feedback from Coinspaid CEO with in the mailing list see here - https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-December/021240.html\r\n> \r\n> We have not seen any impact of full RBF on double spend rates for our trxs which seems to put in large question the stated figure of 40% adoption by miners at such a rate of adoption we would expect to see a large increase in double spends. We expect once this setting become default this will greatly change the adoption of this service.\r\n> \r\n> GAP600 model targets not to get it wrong and as such we are very sensitive to any double spend which we get wrong in predicting as we reimburse our clients.

Relying on heuristics to make assumptions about safety outside of that perverts incentives horribly, some business being able to afford to purchase/generate the relevant data giving them an advantage over those just waiting for confirmations and using bitcoin itself for which there is as low a barrier of entry as possible.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is not obligated to follow a development path that maintains your business model and indeed would do well to make it unviable just as it would chain-anal companies.",

This negative impact could be avoided by simply adding first seen safe rule - ie a trx can be replaced but needs to include the original outputs. At GAP600 we continue to see strong use of our service for BTC we have seen circa 350k unique trx hash per month (over the last 3 months) requested to our platform. Our clients include - Coinpayments, Coinspaid and Changelly.\r\n> I checked, and Coinpayments and Coinspaid are both merchant processors. I could not find any example of actual merchants using their platform accepting unconfirmed payments. I also could not find any documentation on their websites indicating unconfirmed transaction acceptance. As for Changelly, their website says right on the front that \"With an average transaction speed of 5–40 minutes, we ensure you can swiftly take advantage of market opportunities.\" Obivously, 5 minutes is not an unconfirmed payment. Additionally, I verified myself by doing test transactions with BIP125 disabled and an adequate fee: unconfirmed payments are not accepted by Changelly. As their exchange flow clearly says \"Once BTC is confirmed in the blockchain, we’ll start exchanging it to <coin>.\" You need to provide an genuine example of an actual merchant who accepts unconfirmed transactions as payment, and actually relies on first-seen behavior.\r\n> We have not seen any impact of full RBF on double spend rates for our trxs\r\n> Based on the above findings, this appears to be because you don't actually have any clients who rely on unconfirmed payments.\r\n\r\n",

For example, an anti-virus program or other program may scan the file and move it into quarantine, or delete it, or corrupt it.\r\n\r\nWhile the local wallet is expected to re-submit any pending transactions, unrelated transactions may be missing from the mempool after a restart. This may cause fee estimates to be off, or may cause block relay to be slower.\r\n\r\nFix this, similar to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6650, by rolling a random XOR pattern over the dat file when writing or reading it.\r\n\r\nObviously this can only protect against programs that accidentally and unintentionally are trying to mess with the dat file. Any program that intentionally wants to mess with the dat file can still trivially do so.",

When this happens, why wouldn't nodes then reject that second transaction with spent inputs instead of letting it sit in the mempool? Or if nodes can do this, remove the spent input and associated output from the transaction so the rest of the unspent inputs go through as fast as the CoinJoin multiparty Tx fee lets them. Has there ever been discussion of using cryptographic proofs of transactions sent between nodes/wallets to determine if a coin input has already been submitted to the blockchain and using that to reject \"double-spends\" of that coin(unless the transactions are marked for with ability to be replaced)? I'd think that would stop the issue of double spent coins in CoinJoins/multiparty transactions causing it to be stuck in the mempool for a long time",

      "body": "> All of those transactions are taken from my OpenTimestamps calendars. My OTS calendars bump fees repeatedly, increasing the feerate by 1sat/vb with each replacement, starting at approximately the minimum relay fee.\r\n\r\nYes, that is a pretty perfect mechanism if you want to create a false positive for \"full rbf\" when all you're actually triggering is eviction from the mempool due to a change in minfee. For nodes that don't run \"full rbf\", they'll see one of the early transactions, add it to the mempool, then ignore any replacements for a while, until their local minfee drops below the original transaction, at which point they'll accept the first replacement they see. Presuming that takes a while, that replacement will then have a high fee, and be included in their templates. That matches all the examples you gave.\r\n\r\nIt does not match some recent txs mined by antpool, though: eg [b4a8d9...](https://mempool.space/tx/b4a8d9d32c43706ab9ec80955e91cf44fef8f4b557781818486ebb7b8b1238c2) at 17.1sat/vb seems to have been mined in the first block that any of its alternatives paid sufficiently for, and there doesn't seem to be any indication that the minfee should have risen above even the fee of the initial alternative (a6f344845e58d6ef288870b37674942d0505d9ee64f0d289164c3f401be8c086) at 5.98sat/vb (statoshi's graphs indicate a max minfee around that time of 5.6sat/vb).\r\n\r\nAll of the data being linked here (the OTS webpages, fullrbf.mempool.observer and mempool.space) remove that data after at most a couple of weeks which makes it pretty difficult to review. I've made some custom patches to bitcoind to make it easier for me to double check your claims, but that's not convenient or easily reproducible by others either.\r\n\r\n> Please delete your comment as it is factually incorrect and misleading. Frankly I'm surprised that you are so unaware of current mempool policies in use by miners that you were unaware of the fact that full-rbf has been widely adopted.\r\n\r\nInsults and \"delete your comment\" don't make for either scientific or constructive discussion.",
