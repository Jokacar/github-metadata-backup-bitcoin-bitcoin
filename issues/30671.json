IMO loading a chosen wallet successfully would usually be more important.\r\n\r\nIf we changed to not fail startup the main effect would be that `bitcoind` would start up and sync further forwards, increasing the total work and time needed to resync _back_ to a consistent state for that wallet. Therefore it seems to make most sense that we fail \"early and fast\" if we need a resync (for any reason) that way minimising the work and bandwidth used on the node and on the network.\r\n\r\nI guess this could become more complicated in a multi-wallet setup where you may not want a single wallet failing to load to shutdown the whole node though.\r\n\r\nOther options are to remove the failing wallet from the config or restart with `-nowallet` if starting up at all costs is more important to you.",

I would prefer bitcoind to run independently from a wallet by default. I don't see a reason for a wallet to drive behaviur of bitcoind. Also, blocked startup of bitcoind could be seen as a (minor?) security issue.\r\n\r\n> Therefore it seems to make most sense that we fail \"early and fast\" if we need a resync (for any reason) that way minimising the work and bandwidth used on the node and on the network.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning doesn't justify bitcoind startup to be dependent on a wallet. Even if, then a wallet state could have been synced from chainstate/UTXO set with txindex without additional work and bandwith consumed. Ideally, wallet should keep syncing with new data and warning (about old data being not fully synced).",
