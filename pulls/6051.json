    "body": "Dependencies:\n- ~~MOVEONLY: Move constants to consensus.h #5696~~\n- ~~Separate CValidationState from main #5669~~\n- ~~Consensus: Refactor: Separate CheckFinalTx from main::IsFinalTx #6063~~\n- ~~Consensus: Decouple ContextualCheckBlockHeader from checkpoints #5975~~\n- ~~Separate Consensus::CheckTxInputs and GetSpendHeight in CheckInputs #6061~~\n\nI'm sorry for killing commit ids and creating new PRs so easily around this, but I really needed to explore different ways serializing/parallelizing  this. And my conlusion is that everything gets more readable if we do the moveonly first, it is specially important for libconsensus API proposals and how could they potentially change bitcoin core's storage more readable.\nSince Script is already exposed, I think the remaining types to be verified by libconsensus are: Transaction, BlockHeader and Block.\n\nFor each one of them we will want to expose a full verification function. Additionally, we may want to expose checks in phases, for example, in the way that is already separated in bitcoin core, mostly to prevent DoS attacks and to put policy checks in between (ie: context-less checks before storage-dependent checks, expensive script validation the last thing, etc). I don't think the intermediary checks will generate a lot of discussion, since if we can reach the full validation version for each of the types with proper C APIs, exposing any subset of the checks will probably be easy. So I will focus on the full validation functions for now and calling them VerifyTx, VerifyHeader and VerifyBlock respectively.\n\nBut this is not moving everything necessary for libconsensus. Before it is possible for libconsensus to expose full block verification, it has to be able to verify block headers and transactions independently. \nSo we know VerifyBlock comes after VerifyTx and VerifyHeader, but we don't know whether VerifyTx or VerifyHeader will be ready first. Because they depend on discussions about CCoinsViewCache and\nCBlockIndex respectively about how to expose its storage, which may require or fit well with structural changes in how bitcoin core stores them, for example, if UTXO commitments are going to be softforked in some way, the API for VerifyTx should be forward compatible with that, which may delay its exposure.\n\nAnd because we don't want to unnecessarily make libbitcoin bigger unless something more it's going to be exposed, I thought that having two cpp files could be useful, I named them txverify.cpp and blockverify.cpp but it's open to bikesheding. The point is that when one is ready you can add it to libconsensus while leaving the other in the server building module. \n\nOnce they're both ready, a last moveonly commit after this one will be required to expose a C API for full block rule validation, that new code can go in blockverify.cpp\n\nThe intention of moving all the function declarations that we know we will need (for example, main::CheckBlock) without moving the actual code to a cpp in the same commit is to minimize the number of include restructuring commits, they can all be done right after this PR.\nAlternatively the block declarations can be delayed, but I believe that it's worth it to move all transaction and header declarations in the same commmit since it doesn't take that much to move it all fast (see the non-moveonly commits in this PR, they're quite trivial).\n",

The transactions wouldn't show up until confirmed, nor would they be included in the unconfirmed balance. Similar to the mempool behavior fix in 665bdd3b, the wallet code was calling IsFinalTx() directly without taking into account the fact that doing so tells you if the transaction could have been mined in the _current_ block, rather than the next block.\n\nInstead of changing the wallet code, this commit simply changes the semantics of IsFinalTx() when the block height isn't provided to use the height of the next block. The resulting semantics return true if the transaction in question could included in the next block, significantly less confusing and more useful than the previous semantics.\n",

Transaction confirmation times for transactions with a given fee will rise; very-low-fee transactions will fail to get confirmed at all.\n2. Average transaction fee paid will rise\n3. People or applications unwilling or unable to pay the rising fees will stop submitting transactions\n4. People and businesses will shelve plans to use Bitcoin, stunting growth and adoption\n\nThat will be a major economic shift from the status-quo of low transaction fees. See the preliminary BIP100 proposal: http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf for more discussion.\n\nThere is rough (but not 100%) consensus that at some point fees will rise \"high enough\" that the 1MB blocksize limit will have to be raised, but no consensus on what that point should be and no consensus on any process to determine what that point should be.\n\n[BIP 101](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/163) and the changes in this pull request are intended to keep the economic status quo (and keep Bitcoin growing) while acknowledging the engineering reality that networks do not have infinite bandwidth.\n\nI addressed technical objections in a series of blog posts at http://gavinandresen.ninja/time-to-roll-out-bigger-blocks .\n\nAny consensus rule change should have thorough code review and time for testing, so I am submitting this code now so that it has thorough code review and testing before transaction volume gets closer to the one megabyte limit.\n\nHigher-level discussions on the merits of BIP 101 versus other proposals belongs on the bitcoin-dev mailing list (which just moved: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev )-- please limit the conversation here to discussion of the code changes, and rest assured these changes will not be pulled into Bitcoin Core unless there is consensus around BIP 101.\n",

          "body": "This replaces/includes #6625 (previously #6526), #6009, #6051 and #6591 (previously #6024).\n\nEDIT (further explanation demanded):\n\nAlthough the PRs linked from here can provide a better explanation of the motivation, it is not so convenient for reviewers since they have to go through them individually.\n\nThe first 4 commits are taken from #6625, which is a modification of #6526 that doesn't break some other things. The modifications are explained in #6625. Although the #6526 has an extensive description, I will summarize its general purpose here.\nThe goal is to prepare the consensus code for an eventual block size hardfork and also for previous testing. It should simplify other PRs like #6382 (that introduces `std::numeric_limits<uint64_t>::max()` testnet chains to test different block sizes), #6451 (BIP102) or any other block-size-related proposal.\n\nThe next commit is taken from #6009, which separates GetMedianTimePast() from CBlockIndex and moves it to consensus (it's done in the same commit instead of the next one because it's \"cheaper diff-wise\"). GetMedianTimePast() is needed for verifying block headers, but chain.o will not.\n\nThe next commit is the code movement. All consensus critical functions that are not separated already (like 4 of the 5 functions in pow.o [the other one can be separated out]) in build-separable files are moved. If you think any of the moved functions are not consensus critical or that there's some missing functions, please, say so. One exception is main::ConnectBlock() which is consensus critical but contains other things that are not welcomed in libconsensus. A VerifyBlock library-safe function can be extracted from it later. #6051 was a similar movement.\n\nThe last commit is taken from  #6591 (previously #6024). This one has 2 purposes:\n\n1) Remove chainparams.h and timedata.h dependencies (which are not library-friendly) from consensus.o \n2) It's part of a bigger process (see #5970 ) to eventually be able to remove the pCurrentParams global (hidden behind `Params()`, but still a global). I hope I don't need to explain here why removing globals is a desirable thing...\n",
