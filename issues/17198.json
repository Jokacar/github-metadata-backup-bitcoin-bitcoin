      "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI created a list from the output of @practicalswift 's command and am now going it through one by one. It's also a good way to learn Bitcoin's APIs. ;)\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nsrc/util/threadnames.cpp:const std::string& util::ThreadGetInternalName() { return g_thread_name; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've checked its references throughout the code and it seems that this string reference never does anything with the data it owns. So, why not converting it into a **string_view**, that is: **boost::string_view**, because currently no C++17 support in Bitcoin, if I am not mistaken.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's the **Logger** class [that deals with strings](https://github.com/brakmic/bitcoin/blob/master/src/logging.cpp#L267).\r\n\r\nAnd this is where I had to stop, because I didn't want to change Logger itself. All other parts of the code where **ThreadGetInternalName()** was used could be changed to string_view without any interference. So, maybe I should have tried to change Logger, because it would make sense for a Logger to never own any data. Would it make sense? I don't know, only speculating.\r\n\r\nI am not saying, that this should be done (the *string_view*, I mean), or that it even makes sense, but in general, when something doesn't do anything with data it points to, then it should not own it. Also, *string_view*s can be passed by value without any performance hit, while references always have a redirection in them.\r\n\r\nLet's see what other functions have to offer. :)\r\n\r\nRegards,",

A lot of these cases listed in the OP feel like classic examples of premature optimization :)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it is not only a premature optimization but it also unnecessarily introduce sharp edges that might hit us in the form of life-time issues in the future.

Changing from `boost::condition_var` to `std::condition_var` means `threadGroup.interrupt_all` isn't enough to interrupt `serviceQueue` anymore, so that means calling `stop()` before `join_all()` is needed. And the existing reverselock.h code doesn't work with sync.h's DebugLock code (because the reversed lock won't be removed from `g_lockstack` which then leads to incorrect potential deadlock warnings), so I've replaced that with a dedicated class and macro that's aware of our debug lock behaviour.\r\n\r\nFixes #16027, Fixes #14200, Fixes #18227",

Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter.
