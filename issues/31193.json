    "title": "(Past issue) On Windows, pruned nodes could crash while deleting a block file",
    "body": "This was reported by @andrewtoth to the security list on 2022-12-20 and fixed in #26533. The security team at the time determined it was indeed a bug but not a vulnerability.\r\n\r\nI'm opening this issue in public in order to leave a trace of this bug, which as far as i know wasn't public yet.\r\n\r\nOriginal email from Andrew Toth on 2022-12-20: \r\n> Hello,\r\n> \r\n> I have discovered a bug that can cause pruned nodes running on Windows to crash. Keeping an open file handle to a blk*.dat file on Windows can cause std::filesystem::remove to fail, but the version used at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/node/blockstorage.cpp#L561-L562 is using the version that will throw on error https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/remove. According to cppreference it will only return false if the file doesn't exist, not if there was a problem deleting it.\r\n> \r\n> Discovered as I was implementing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26308#discussion_r1042084733. Fix is in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2653. It doesn't disclose that this causes a pruned node to crash, just that it won't delete the block file.\r\n> \r\n> Regards,\r\n> Andrew",
