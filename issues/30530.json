    "title": "Nuke format linter",
    "body": "The linter is impossible to maintain, because it is not possible to parse C++ with a simple regex. When it produces nonsense, like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/runs/27958379841, it is mostly annoying, because the code is perfectly fine, but the red CI is a blocker for the pull request. Also, fixing it isn't trivially possible, so the only solution is to juggle with the code until the regex in the linter is pleased.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to write it as a clang-tidy plugin, however that isn't ideal either, because that will (normally) only run in CI and takes a long time.\r\n\r\nIdeally, it is implemented in `consteval` C++, directly in the source code. (Similar to Rust `std::fmt` or C++20 `std::format`, but we don't want to use that, because it is likely locale-dependent and still broken on most supported compilers in some edge cases)",
