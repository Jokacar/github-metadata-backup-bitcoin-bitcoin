    "title": "Prune Node Rescan Project Tracking",
    "body": "This issue will be edited frequently to reflect the current status of the project.\r\n\r\n#### What should I review now? \r\n\r\n👇 👇 👇 👇 👇 👇\r\n#28170  and #28955\r\n☝️ ☝️ ☝️ ☝️ ☝️ ☝️ \r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to enable complete blockchain rescan capability on prune nodes, allowing these storage-limited nodes to import new wallet descriptors and update existing ones at any time, as well as loading external and un-synced wallets with a birth-time older than 48 hours. This, in turn, enables the monitoring of new addresses/scripts and tracking balance changes without the need to repeatedly download the entire blockchain.\r\n\r\nThe first project milestone introduces the feature for prune nodes that construct and maintain a local block filters set database. The node will request and keep track of the missing historical blocks that match the wallet scripts filters set to subsequently perform the rescan.\r\n\r\n#### The following sections are ordered by their PRs dependencies:\r\n\r\n##### Net: Single Block Requests Tracking System and On Download Failure Retry Mechanism\r\n* [ ] #28170\r\n* [ ] #28120\r\n* [ ] #27837\r\n\r\n##### Indexes Stability and Performance Improvements\r\n* [X] #27607\r\n* [X] #27720\r\n* [ ] #28955\r\n* [ ] #26966\r\n\r\n##### Wallet Rescan (depends on the net section)\r\n* [X] #27469\r\n* [ ] Cache wallet filters' set and connect it to the current wallet rescan functionality.

The wallet is only about 2 weeks old and typical settings are used (data pruned to 2 GB).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n- A wallet is loaded (either manually or automatically on startup) and addresses are shown in Bitcoin-qt, \r\n- successful execution of wallet RPC commands, e.g. getwalletinfo, dumpwallet, walletpassphrasechange etc. \r\n\r\n(not different from the way it had worked and looked the previous time a user started Bitcoin Core).\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\n![wallet loading failed  Prune](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111286121/222418406-67836dd2-f28b-4611-baeb-055ae21d9834.png)\r\n\r\n> Wallet loading failed. Prune: last wallet synchronisation goes beyond pruned data. You need to -reindex (download the whole blockchain again in case of pruned node)\r\n\r\nAlso, RPC commands fail, for example: loadwallet, getwalletinfo, dumpwallet (except for listwallets).\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Start Bitcoin-qt\r\n2. Select File->Open Wallet->[Wallet name]\r\n\r\nReproducible every time in prune mode. The wallet was created at the time for which data were pruned. The wallet was created in bitcoin-qt.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nOfficial binary Bitcoin Core 24.0.1, Windows 11.",
