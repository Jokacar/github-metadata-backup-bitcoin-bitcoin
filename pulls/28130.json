For those who want to limit data carrying outputs, `-datacarriersize` is still supported, and has the functionality of applying the specified data carrier limit as well as limiting the number of data carrying OP_RETURN outputs to one. If `-datacarriersize=0` is set, no data carrying output is allowed.\r\n    \r\nRational: there's lots of ways for people to publish data in the Bitcoin chain, and lots of data has been published.

The arguments for this include miner incentive compatibility, maximization of fees per block through next-block priority-competition, utility for merchants and consumers, intelligent double-spend risk mitigation, protection of the user space, and optimization of Bitcoin adoption, utility, and activity.\r\n\r\nI apologize for not yet having a reference link with full details of all of my arguments, but I am happy to interact with commenters on any arguments for a full RBF agenda here. I can also alleviate any concerns with current zero-conf acceptance risk mitigation.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate being heard, and having a fair chance to be reviewed and considered.\r\n\r\nI also need time for consideration because I am assisting some merchants and users with understanding how to interface with Bitcoin Core and what is happening, so they can express their support for this PR, and their value of zero-conf being useful as a service. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I am advocating for the Bitcoin network state that has thrived for its entire history so far, and asking that Bitcoin Core avoid steering policy.",

          "body": "The `MANDATORY_SCRIPT_VERIFY_FLAGS` constant was introduced in #3843 to distinguish between block consensus rules and relay standardness rules. However it was not actually used in the consensus code path: instead it only means that we consider txs that violated a mandatory rule worth banning (or marking as misbehaving), rather than just rejecting the tx and continuing on.\r\n\r\nSince it's not used for consensus, this PR moves it to `policy/policy.h` next to the related `STANDARD_SCRIPT_VERIFY_FLAGS` and `STANDARD_NOT_MANDATORY_VERIFY_FLAGS` constants.\r\n\r\nIt also updates the list of mandatory flags to include the post-p2sh soft forks that are enforced as consensus rules via `GetBlockScriptFlags()`. The effect of this change is that validation.cpp will report `TxValidationResult::TX_CONSENSUS` for txs that fail dersig/csv/cltv/nulldummy/witness/taproot checks, instead of `TX_NOT_STANDARD`, which in turn adds `Misbehaving(100)` via `MaybePunishNodeForTx` in `net_processing`.",

Though probably only with a portion of their total hash power as I've only seen a few potential full-rbf replacements mined by them.\r\n\r\nThat's 37% (+ MARA Pool) of total hash power regularly mining full-rbf transactions.\r\n\r\nObviously, with this much support of full-rbf, arguments against it on the basis that unconfirmed transactions are safe are even more clearly invalid. Secondly, on the basis of mempool consistency with miners, since full-rbf is the compatible policy in almost all cases, we should be supporting it by default if you take the position that we want to optimize for consistency with miners. (CC: @achow101) Thirdly, all previous arguments in favor of full-rbf, such as multiparty transactions, wallets, user-expectations, etc. still apply.\r\n\r\nThis simplification of mempool policy is well overdue. Let's get this merged and this silly debate over with. Miners and node operators who choose to disable full-rbf still can with a simple configuration change.\r\n\r\n",

Large amounts of data are already published in the bitcoin blockchain in a variety of ways. Heck, `-permitbaremultisig` is still allowed by default, and people still use it to publish data in the form of spendable and even unspendable outputs. And unlike OP_Return outputs, bare multisig outputs have caused issued due to Bitcoin's broken sigop counting scheme; the OP_Return mechanism was carefully designed to avoid this problem years ago.\r\n\r\nThis proposed change simply cleans up a bit of remaining standardness paternalism; we've gotten rid of essentially all other standardness paternalism. I can't think of any standardness mechanism other than OP_Return and first-seen (which I'm arguing to remove by default in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28132)  that doesn't have a strong technical reason to exist.\r\n\r\n> > is paying me $1000 for 10 hours work to do this pull-req\r\n> \r\n> That's great, but others have to spend hours reviewing this stuff, plus occasionally having to deal with the brigading.

You could recap the original arguments for the 80 byte limit, that (since SegWit?) inscriptions and similar methods already allow adding more. Also remind the reader what the effective size limit will be without that limit and how that compares to inscriptions.\r\n> \r\n> Mention a few use cases that require more than 80 bytes (at the time IIRC nobody did, the discussion was only between 40 and 80).\r\n\r\n@ChristopherA You're welcome to respond to this, here or on the mailing list.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think the continued existence of so many other data publications mechanisms, including clearly problematic ones like UTXO-creating bare-multisig, puts the burden of proof on arguing that we should have an arbitrary 80 byte limit.\r\n\r\n> Can it be used to pin transactions in a way that unupgraded nodes (including poorly maintained alternative implementations that are potentially used in second layer protocols) wouldn't notice?\r\n\r\nI don't consider that to be a valid complaint. Any difference in relay policy can do that. We do not bring up that objection every single time we choose to tweak relay policy. Protocols that are so fragile that they can't tolerate minor differences in relay policy are simply broken and should be fixed.",

Others said they might contribute to that bounty as well. My real goal was to have a legitimate discussion, which is what we have been having here. It is a discussion in PRs, with working code, that is how change really happens in bitcoin.\r\n\r\nMy goal is not \"non-bitcoin stuff\". My specific challenge is that Lightning and Nostr use public keys in a persistent way that are not rotatable, which is a bad cryptographic practice. By committing to a rotated key and some other cryptographic in advance in L1, they could be.  I believe this could be as small as a signed hash and a little metadata. However, this is larger than 80-byte limit in OP_RETURN. I can now put it into an inscription-style transaction and even get a 4x discount, or use bare multisig, or use some other trick.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'd prefer not to use a \"trick\", and use OP_RETURN as it is easy to identify, was explicitly created for this purpose, is not a hack, and nodes can easily ignore them. Given that the OP_RETURN limit is a relic of `is_standard`, and as @instagibbs said is \"the last remaining 'paternalism' restriction in the codebase\", and there are multiple ways to do what I'm seeking in less \"honest\" ways, so why have this legacy limit at all? Thus my reasoning to contribute to the bounty for this PR.\r\n\r\nIf @petertodd doesn't have time to continue to continue to support this PR, I'm glad to contribute toward bounties (hopefully with others) for others to keep it active.\r\n\r\n-- Christopher Allen, Blockchain Commons",

      "body": "> My goal is not \"non-bitcoin stuff\". My specific challenge is that Lightning and Nostr use public keys in a persistent way that are not rotatable, which is a bad cryptographic practice. By committing to a rotated key and some other cryptographic in advance in L1, they could be. I believe this could be as small as a signed hash and a little metadata.\r\n\r\n@ChristopherA can you clarify why is it imperative for this use case to store that data on the Bitcoin blockchain?\r\n\r\nTo give you some insight into my point of view: I'm a Bitcoin user and full node runner and my primary concern is that running a full node continues to be affordable for the rest of the 21st century, as it's necessary to maintain a global network of independent validators & copies of the blockchain. Storing non-transactional data in the blockchain makes this arbitrarily more difficult. Ceteris paribus if we encourage using the Bitcoin blockchain as a storage medium there will be much less full nodes in 2070 than otherwise. Personally I'd like to see the devs working on new standardness rules to fight the spam, not removing the existing ones.\r\n\r\nSo I hope you'll understand why I don't agree with removing `-datacarrier` nor increasing the default `-datacarriersize`, but I'm willing to live by the status quo. I'd like to ask you to try to work around the 80 byte limit if at all possible, maybe with a more compact hash and metadata encoding scheme.",

Removing the spam protection for op_return outputs effectively results in a discount for small inscriptions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, you're saying yourself that you want this change because it makes it easier for you to use the chain for contentious non-bitcoin use cases such as inscribing Nostr keys. However, the reason why you currently have to use hacks to do that is simply because others just don't want to have to download and store your data to use Bitcoin. The fact that we can't prevent these kind of spam attacks is not a justification to make the problem worse. \r\n\r\nAlso I wonder why you don't use torrents to store your data? \r\n\r\n",
