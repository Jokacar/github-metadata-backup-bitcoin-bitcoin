But while sent INV and GETDATA messages are constructed by aggregating them, and then sending them out in batch during SendMessages, NOTFOUND is sent immediately.\r\n\r\nThis means that separate `GETDATA`s (which do seem sent by some network clients) always result in separate `NOTFOUND`s, a potential waste of outbound bandwidth. Improve upon this by introducing Peer state `m_notfounds_to_send`, aggregating them there during `GETDATA` processing, and sending the result out when it either overflows or during SendMessages.",

It doesn't do any other cleanup.\r\n\r\nOpening for discussion of gotchas / brainstorming / concept (N)ACKs.\r\n\r\n1 question from a reviewer was whether we should keep some sort of warning around for if our clock differs too much from our peers. Although it's unclear how useful that might be.\r\n\r\nCommits can be cleaned up / sqaushed. Missing release notes etc.\r\nWould close #4521.",

However, the outbound eviction logic is not covered by any fuzz tests and is only testable by spinning up both a connman and peerman.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits out the eviction logic into its own component `EvictionManager`. In addition to isolating the eviction logic, we get rid of several layer violations (e.g. `CConnman::ForEachNode/ForNode` calls, `CNode::m_last_block_time`, etc.) between `net` and `net processing`.\r\n\r\nOne instance of the `EvictionManager` is created at start up and passed as a reference to the connection and peer managers.

          "body": "The block index might contain stale blocks that are not part of the main chain. If a malicious peer is able to probe a node's block index for certain stale blocks then it can use this information to fingerprint the node.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving headers (either through a `cmpctblock` or `headers` messages) a node will send `getheaders` if the predecessor of the first header does not exist. This leaks information from the block index if the predecessor of the header is a stale block because no `getheaders` will be sent in that case revealing that the stale block exists in the index.\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents this fingerprinting by sending additional `getheaders` messages in cases where not doing so leaks the existence of stale blocks. To determine when additional messages should be send, we introduce the `PeerManagerImpl::m_chain_tips_sets` map which keeps track of seen chain tips per network, effectively creating a per network view of the node's global block index.  We only try to accept new headers if they connect to anything in our global index and they connect to our active chain or to a chain that was previously sent to us by a peer on the same network. We send a `getheaders` message should these conditions not be met.",

This increases privacy and will also make it harder to perform fingerprinting attacks (connecting our identities over different networks).\r\n\r\nManual Block-Relay connections:\r\n- can be specified with `-addnode` RPC, both with the `add` and `onetry` command\r\n- can be specified with the `-addnode` bitcoind arg (or in bitcoin.conf) with `<IP>=manual-block-relay`\r\n- don't participate in transaction and address relay\r\n- don't get discouraged / punished for misbehavior (but will still get disconnected for sending TX/tx-INV as automatic block-relay-only peers do)\r\n- are not subject to outbound eviction logic (unlike automatic block-relay-only-peers)\r\n",

          "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #10102 + #19460.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`5f91aa3d8b47` multiprocess: Add bitcoin-gui -ipcconnect option](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461/commits/5f91aa3d8b47cee97e625c3b5689a37dbd941eff)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBuilding on #10102, this adds an `-ipcconnect` option to `bitcoin-gui` that connects the GUI to an existing `bitcoin-node` process already running in the background instead of spawning a new `bitcoin-node` process. This allows the GUI to be started and stopped independently of the node. By default with this change, `bitcoin-gui` will check if a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` socket exists and try to connect to that. If that doesn't work, it will spawn a new node process and start up the same way it did before this PR.\r\n\r\nThe default `bitcoin-gui` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which tries to connect if possible as described above, and spawns a new `bitcoin-node` process if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to never connect to an existing node and always spawn a new one, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, basic functionality works and gui instances can connect and disconnect from a running node. But there are rough edges: If a gui process doesn't shut down cleanly, the node can see unhandled IpcExceptions, and if node command line options are passed to `bitcoin-gui` and `bitcoin-gui` connects to an exiting bitcoin-node process instead of spawning a new one, the node options will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)",

          "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #10102.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`bbefbd3c199b` multiprocess: Add -ipcconnect and -ipcbind options](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19460/commits/bbefbd3c199b189188d6427b4564b17477c6d50e)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBuilding on #10102, this adds an `-ipcconnect` option to `bitcoin-wallet` and an `-ipcbind` option to `bitcoin-node` (both enabled by default in multiprocess builds) so bitcoin node will listen on a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` unix socket, and `bitcoin-wallet` will connect to it.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that `bitcoin-wallet` can be extended in the future to have some online functionality. For example, there could be a `bitcoin-wallet sync` command that will update balances and sync latest transactions to an unloaded wallet, or a `bitcoin-wallet serve` subcommand that loads a wallet and serves RPC requests, or a `bitcoin-wallet shell` subcommand that allows running RPC methods interactively like the GUI console, or just general support for `bitcoin-wallet <rpc method> <rpc params>` invocations suggested https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13926#issuecomment-455187379.\r\n\r\nThis PR is small and doesn't do much. The only visible change is that `bitcoin-wallet` now checks whether a node socket exists on startup and prints \"Connected to IPC address\" if it can connect it it.\r\n\r\nThe default `bitcoin-wallet` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which connects if possible as described above, and proceeds offline if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to disable ipc, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\r\n\r\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)\r\n",

          "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an `--enable-multiprocess` configure option which builds new `bitcoin-node`, `bitcoin-wallet`, and `bitcoin-gui` executables with relevant functionality isolated into different processes. See [doc/design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/design/multiprocess.md) for usage details and future plans.\r\n\r\nThe change is implemented by adding a new [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that spawns new wallet and node subprocesses that can be controlled over a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) by calling [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/node.h), [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/wallet.h), and [`ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/chain.h) methods. When running with split processes, you can see the IPC messages going back and forth in `-debug=1` output. Followup PR's #19460 and #19461 add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\r\n\r\nThe IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/ipc/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSlides from a presentation describing this change are available on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).\r\n",

It looks like there's a lot of commits, but **only the last 12 commits belong in this PR**. The rest will be merged with upstream PRs.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).\r\n\r\nBIP324 is [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki).\r\n\r\n### Running a v2 node\r\n#### Get the code\r\n```\r\ngit remote add bip324 git@github.com:dhruv/bitcoin.git\r\ngit fetch bip324\r\ngit checkout bip324/bip324-enable\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Build for your OS\r\n\r\nFollow the appropriate instructions [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md)\r\n\r\n#### Run the node\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoind -conf=CONFIG_FILE -v2transport=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Connect with a friend's v2 node\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -conf=CONFIG_FILE addnode \"FRIEND_IP:FRIEND_PORT\" \"add\" true\r\n```\r\nThe last parameter(`p2p_v2:true`) signals to your node that the peer is running a v2 supportive client and we should attempt to make an encrypted P2P connection (you're simulating the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag advertisement manually). Should that fail however (say because the peer told you mistakenly, lied, etc.), this code will downgrade the connection to unencrypted v1 transport.\r\n\r\n### Things you are helpful to test\r\n\r\n* If your friend's node is a v2 node, you can see with wireshark that the bytes are pseudorandom (the easiest way to confirm this is that with a v1 connection, wireshark will tell you it has detected a Bitcoin connection and it'll even parse out the metadata like message type, etc; with v2, wireshark has no idea -- of course that _could_ be because wireshark does simply not know v2, but it is because the bytestream is pseudorandom)\r\n* Compare the v2 encrypted session id exposed via `getpeerinfo` as `v2_session_id` with your friend.\r\n* Add another peer that is actually v1, but try `addnode` still indicating v2 support. You should see with wireshark that after a failed attempt at a v2 handshake, the connection is downgraded to unencrypted v1 and wireshark can parse it.\r\n\r\nI've been told there are v2 nodes running at (happy to update the list as more people run persistent v2 nodes; message me and I'll add it here):\r\n```\r\nbe.anyone.eu.org\r\nrp7k2go3s5lyj3fnj6zn62ktarlrsft2ohlsxkyd7v3e3idqyptvread.onion:8333\r\njdcoysubtxazi7dketpyb5rnjorvxad4onftveohash2pdwkgw4bvnqd.onion:8333\r\nxci6cphki2pdb5qe7axzrcxcxabkbm24z4zlv2hn4ziy6grquqco2kyd.onion:8333\r\nslvtesfgg3mkksqqzh67al4sq6dx3rhlzqepa4ny7jonzuckg6msf3id.onion:8333\r\ngifm4fnj3vua664xhgeanx5fnpco3txkqy4amr4txbfsciiyrkxpf2qd.onion:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::3:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::a6d6:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1a:365::2:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1b:365:aa20:66ff:fe3f:1909:8333\r\n184.74.240.157:8533\r\n95.179.145.232:8333\r\n```",

They'll all be removed when the parent PRs get merged.\r\n\r\n### commits overview\r\n1. Introducing cryptographic constructs(HKDF, ECDH, ChaCha20, Poly1305, FSChaCha20 and FSChaCha20Poly1305) in the test framework to help with P2P encryption.\r\n2. Performing v2 P2P encryption in a v2 connection.\r\n    * introduces a new class `EncryptedP2PState` to store the keys, functions for performing the initial v2 handshake and encryption/decryption.\r\n    * this class is used by `P2PConnection` in inbound/outbound connections to perform the initial v2 handshake before the v1 version handshake. Only after the initial v2 handshake is performed do application layer P2P messages(version, verack etc..) get exchanged. (in a v2 connection)\r\n    * the encrypted P2P messages follow a different format - 3 byte length + 1-13 byte message_type + payload + 16 byte MAC\r\n    * includes support for testing decoy messages and v2 connection downgrade(using false advertisement - when a v2 node makes an outbound connection to a node which doesn't support v2 but is advertised as v2 by some malicious\r\nintermediary)\r\n\r\n### run the tests\r\n* functional test - `test/functional/p2p_v2_encrypted.py` `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py`\r\n\r\nI'm also super grateful to @ dhruv for his really valuable feedback on this branch.",

(To run a node with just libbitcoinkernel and a minimal P2P stack to receive blocks)\r\n* The mempool is already treated optional in pretty much every other part of the codebase (validation, RPC, ...), so doing it consistently is preferable.\r\n* Removing the requirement of PeerManager to hold a reference to a mempool makes (unit/fuzz) testing easier if there is a test that doesn't need the mempool. Also, it makes the coupling of CTxMemPool and PeerManager a bit more loose.\r\n\r\nPicked up from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22850\r\n",

      "body": "@ajtowns Thank you for having a look!\r\n\r\n> I think moving these is a good idea. The amount of code touched and the number of conflicting PRs is annoying though.\r\n\r\nI generally do not agree with our \"we hate rebasing\" culture because there is no way to do collaborative development without rebasing. There are ~370 open PRs and avoiding conflicts is basically impossible. Merging something should boil down to whether or not the actual change is worthwhile and shouldn't depend on whether or not other people can be bothered to rebase their PRs as a result.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the conflicts here are either drafts, need more work, mine or are failing CI and the rest (afaict) only conflict in a very minor way. But again even if this weren't the case, I think it should just boil down to whether or not my changes are worthwhile.\r\n\r\n> Might be better to move the elements individually when they're useful for some patch that makes an observable change, though, rather than in a dedicated refactoring pr with no immediate benefit?\r\n\r\nThis would take ten times longer, not reduce the number of conflicts and would likely just end up with someone requesting that I split out the \"pure refactoring\" commits into their own PR anyway. So we might as well just rip the band-aid of in one go.\r\n\r\nHow can you say that there is no immediate benefit, when this PR is continuing an ongoing project #19398, that we (as a project) had seemingly agreed on being a worthwhile thing? Basically all PRs related to #19398 have been of this nature. Did they all have no benefit?",

At least one introduced a bug (#21160 vs #26569 / #26616), which is the opposite of an immediate benefit.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I think this is a good idea. But even good ideas need to be prioritised; and for me refactorings default to coming very low on the list -- they easily introduce both immediate costs (review of the refactoring, rebasing and re-review of conflicting PRs) and long term costs (when they introduce bugs despite the review), and the benefits are often only theoretical (\"someday we might write a patch that this helps\") or a matter of opinion (\"this makes the code look better to me\").\r\n\r\n> This would take ten times longer, not reduce the number of conflicts and would likely just end up with someone requesting that I split out the \"pure refactoring\" commits into their own PR anyway.\r\n\r\nThis PR's been open for ~50 days; if no PR is going to benefit from this change for 500 days, then I've got no objection to leaving it unmerged for that long, or closing it and redoing it later. If we do manage a refactoring moratorium, then that will reduce the amount of rebasing of non-refactor PRs. And whether the refactoring is split out into a separate PR doesn't seem like a big deal either way; the cost is time spent reviewing and rebasing, not in making a PR or not...",

This is the most recent time that this peer was the first to notify our node of a new block (one that we didn't already know about), or zero if this peer has never been the first to notify us of a new block. This timestamp already exists internally and is used for stale-tip eviction logic; this PR exposes it at the RPC layer.\r\n\r\nThis PR started out as a suggestion for additional test coverage, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26172#issuecomment-1259678260. It turned out that the easiest way to test (already-merged) #26172 is to add this field to `getpeerinfo` and have a functional test verify its value. But it may also be useful to have this result in its own right, similar to that RPC's existing `last_block` field -- it indicates something about the quality of our peers. It allows one to predict which peer will be evicted when the stale tip logic activates. (I'm not sure if that would be useful, but it may be.)\r\n\r\nThe functional test added here fails without #26172, which is the main goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not test the actual stale-tip eviction logic; that's difficult to do with a functional test. But it does test the correctness of the timestamp that the eviction logic depends on. #23352 is an attempt to test the eviction logic using a unit test, it's not ready to be merged yet. I think having both kinds of tests would be beneficial.",

          "body": "Efficient isolated fuzzing of our message processing code (net processing) would be very valuable. However, to make that deterministic, fast and fuzzer friendly it appears that extensive refactoring is required. There are three main blockers: module separation (net/net processing/validation split), determinism, performance.\r\n\r\nI am gonna use this issue to track and motivate the work that needs to be done. It would be great if we can achieve the same outcome with less refactoring but I don't see how at the moment. Open to suggestions and feedback.\r\n\r\n### Module separation\r\n\r\nOnce we have a clean separation between our net, net processing and validation modules, we can fuzz/test them in isolation to maximize the bug yield (🐛, 🪲, 🪳). By design, most fuzzing engines are not great at finding bugs when the scope of the targets is too large (e.g. fuzzing net, net processing and validation all at once).\r\n\r\n* net / net processing split (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28252)\r\n  * Move application layer data from net to net processing ([#19398](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19398))\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26621\r\n  * Define a clean interface between net processing <-> net \r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25268\r\n      - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25500\r\n      - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25572\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27257\r\n* net processing / validation split (lots of overlap with kernel)\r\n  * Reduce `cs_main` usage in net processing\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26151\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26140\r\n    - [ ] Kill CNodeState\r\n  * Define a clean interface between net processing <-> validation\r\n\r\n### Determinism\r\n\r\nNon-deterministic fuzz targets are less efficient at finding bugs and debugging non-reproducible bugs is annoying/costly.\r\n\r\n* All required components should be newly setup for each target execution\r\n  * Can be done currently using our testing setup suite but that's waaaay too slow for fuzzing.\r\n* Avoid  `GetRand()` (mock it?)\r\n* Avoid globals (are there any globals left in net processing?)\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nFuzzing is a search, the faster the search - the better.\r\n\r\n* LevelDB (is in memory but still slow?)\r\n  * Probably solved by mocking out validation?\r\n* PeerManager construction is expensive because it requires multi megabyte allocations each time (mostly due to large bloom filters)\r\n* Disk usage\r\n  * Block storage\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125\r\n    - [ ] Create a mock of BlockManager for in memory block storage?\r\n  * BanMan (banlist is written to disk)\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n* Decouple net processing from ArgsMan (args setup is slow)\r\n  * Allows to fuzz the peerman options without depending on the global args man \r\n  - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27499\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you think there are PRs that aren't listed here but should be.\r\n",

          "body": "To improve privacy, relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for relaying sensitive data (our own transactions) with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local unbroadcast transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer and the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed\r\n\r\n* Relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers.\r\n\r\n* Hide those transactions from `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` requests, as if we don't have them.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, request the transaction with `GETDATA`, as if we didn't have it before.\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the unbroadcast list.\r\n\r\n* `INV` it to others as a result of the `TX` message we get, like what we do with transactions that are not ours.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new local transaction is received (from the wallet or RPC), the node will send it to 5 (`SENSITIVE_RELAY_NUM_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 5 more peers (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptInitialBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived sensitive relay connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers will blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [x] Disable if `-connect` is used or Tor and I2P are not reachable.\r\n* [x] Use I2P transient connections even if listening on I2P.\r\n* [x] Do something with the user-agent string (could reveal identity if it has been personalized) and make sure no identifying information in the `VERSION` message. Done: took the [suggestion below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#issuecomment-1517896418).\r\n* [x] Improve the condition when we consider the transaction seen by the network: right now a single INV from somebody suffices (this is still an improvement over `master` which is ok right after pushing the tx to a peer). We could wait for more than one INV, from peers that we have selected (outbound) and that are specifically not the ones we broadcasted to (via short-lived connection). Edit: One `INV` should be enough because after that we broadcast the transaction to everybody we are connected to (like if it is not ours).\r\n* [ ] Idea: start with one connection per transaction (not 5 as it is now), optimistically assuming it will be sufficient. (numbers are examples) After 1 minute, if still not received from the network, try 2 connections, after a few minutes try more. If still unsuccessful after 10 minutes, then fall back to the old mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to address:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450\r\n",

          "body": "**WORK IN PROGRESS.** Please do not run it for any use other than testing.\r\n  \r\nThis PR is not meant for merge. This branch exists to help reviewers see what package relay would look like all together. I will open separate PRs for these components and expect to add more tests, docs, and polish along the way. This PR contains all of the functionality built in a linear manner. However, since there are pieces in various areas of the codebase and they can make progress in parallel, commits don't necessarily need to be merged in this order.\r\n\r\n**See #27463 for what PR(s) are open for review right now.**\r\n\r\n## Note to Reviewers\r\n\r\nThe major purpose of this PR is to solicit \"approach\" review.\r\n\r\nThis is a large project, and the first few p2p commits essentially define the interface. I'd like to get rough consensus on approach before we start looking at code details and merging PRs, because I believe it will help us \"get useful stuff in\" faster and avoid premature optimizations.\r\n\r\nHere are some questions I hope are answered before we try to merge anything (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27742#issuecomment-1572205313):\r\n\r\n1. Does the proposed protocol look sound?\r\n2. Are these 3 milestones appropriate?\r\n3. Is there important functionality that is in the \"todo improvements\" section but should be included in one of the 3 milestones? Alternatively, is there not-that-important stuff in the milestones that we should defer until later?\r\n4. Does it make sense to have this PeerManager <-> TxPackageTracker <-> TxOrphanage relationship?\r\n\r\n\r\nComments about naming, typos, code details, etc. are also appreciated but please note I may wait until their respective PRs are open to incorporate your comments. Thank you for your patience.\r\n\r\n## Project Structure\r\n\r\n### 3 Major Milestones\r\n\r\nThis project is split into 3 milestones, each of which gives us something useful.\r\n\r\n1. Modularize and improve orphan-handling (also some refactoring).\r\n\t- Introduce a `TxPackageTracker` class, responsible for orphan handling. It starts out as a wrapper for the `TxOrphanage`.\r\n\t- Use all announcers as potential candidates for resolving an orphan. Add a `TxRequestTracker` Orphan Request Tracker which helps track orphans we need to resolve. Preferentially request orphan resolution from outbounds, preferred relay, etc., over inbounds.\r\n\r\n2. When package relay peers are available, use `ancpkginfo` instead of missing parents when handling orphans.\r\n\t- Add `sendpackages` negotiation logic.\r\n\t- Add a separate rejections filter for transactions that are eligible for reconsideration when validated together as a package, so that children of low-feerate transactions are still considered.\r\n\t- Send `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO)` to package relay peers for orphan resolution. Use `ancpkginfo` to request missing ancestors through normal individual transaction relay.\r\n\r\n3. Download and validate ancestor packages using `getpkgtxns` and `pkgtxns`.\r\n\t- Add support for `getpkgtxns` and `pkgtxns`. Send a `pkgtxns` using the list of missing transactions from `ancpkginfo`.\r\n\t- Ensure we can process \"normal\" orphans even if a peer is trying to overwhelm/churn our orphanage. Do this by \"opportunistically\" protecting orphans from random eviction if they were sent by package relay peers, and redownloading orphans if we cannot afford to protect them. Each peer is allocated a certain amount of orphans they can protect at a time (\"token bucket\" style but the number of tokens is static for now). Outbound peers get more than inbounds.\r\n\t- If a transaction's parent(s) are below the fee filter, don't announce it (save the bandwidth of legacy nodes).\r\n\r\n###  Todo improvements \r\nThese could be added to the milestones or deferred until basic functionality is deployed.\r\n- Store orphans serialized instead of as CTransactionRefs to significantly reduce their memory usage.\r\n- Perhaps try to keep orphans in disk and/or process them asynchronously, given the incredibly DoSable nature of orphan handling.\r\n- Dynamically allocate tokens for orphan protection. For example, if a long-standing inbound peer continuously provides good packages for orphans, they should have more tokens. If a peer is obviously serving us garbage, reduce their tokens.\r\n- Detect when we have received all the transactions for a package, regardless of how (individual or block or other), and return `PackageToValidate`  in `GetTxToReconsider`.\r\n- New format for mempool.dat, packages instead of transactions.",

          "body": "On busy VPS and shared host with limited resources, the time between when a messages is sent to the tcpip send or receive \r\nqueue and when it is sent in the case of send queue, or when it is processed (ProcessMessage) can be in excess of 30 seconds. \r\nThis delay introduces a skew in AdjustedTime.\r\n\r\nFor the receive queue, the post processing uses the receive time prior to entering the queue to calculate TimeOffset rather than Now()  which currently includes the delay in the queue.\r\n\r\nFor the send queue, the queued message is altered to update the nTime of the message to the actual time it is being sent rather than the time at which it was queued\r\n\r\nWas tested on an hp 370 G6 24 core 3ghz 192gb host with the daemon launched with -par=2 to restrict the resources of the \r\ndaemon. Logging was added pre-patch to document the delay through the queue and was observed for both send and receive to be occasionally > 30 seconds when the daemon was busy following the tip or during reorgs when the cup utilization for the assigned core  approached 100%.  Significant queue delay occurs most often in the receive queue (several times a minute) and infrequently in the send queue ( 1 observation in several hours of testing ).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n  _Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply._\r\n- [X ] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [X ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [ ] I have added or updated relevant unit/integration/functional/e2e tests\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have assigned this pull request to a milestone _(for repository code-owners and collaborators only)_\r\n",

          "body": "This PR is supposed to provide context for some of the refactoring PRs I've been working on (#25268, #26621, etc).\r\n\r\nThe aim is to completely decouple CConnman and its internals from PeerManager to allow for isolated testing of our message processing code (isolated from net only as isolating from validation is another can of worms). To get there, this work refactors CConnman's API to use `NodeId` as the primary handle for managing connections and defines a new interface `ConnectionsInterface` that describes the interface between PeerManager and CConnman. The result is that CNode is no longer part of this interface and access to it is no longer needed within net processing.\r\n\r\nMost of the API simply shifts from `CConnman::DoX(CNode*)` to `CConnman::DoX(NodeId)` and where possible the PR minimizes the need for new methods on `CConnman` to avoid the slight overhead of (internally) locking `m_nodes_mutex` to look up the right `CNode` by its id.\r\n\r\nSome steps this PR is taking:\r\n\r\n- [ ] We can't test PeerManager in isolation if it is not the owner of its own state. Therefore this PR moves all the remaining application layer data from net to net processing.\r\n- [ ] Some use of CNode in net processing only accesses constant data that is available from the time of connection establishment. This PR introduces `ConnectionContext` which is meant to hold all this constant connection data and for each connection a copy is stored on the corresponding `Peer` instance. This reduces the need for accessing CNode in net processing and avoids some `For{Each}Node` calls (which are a horrible layer violation).\r\n- [ ] Some use of CNode in net processing directly modifies eviction related members of CNode. Instead of wrapping access to these members in CConnman methods, this PR creates a new manager (EvictionManager) that encapsulates the eviction logic as well as the required per-peer data (entirely removing the relevant CNode members).\r\n- [ ] To disconnect a peer , PeerManager directly sets the disconnection flag `CNode::fDisconnect` to true. This PR wraps access to that flag on `CConnman`, i.e. `CConnman::IsDisconnected` & `CConnman::DisconnectNode(NodeId)`.\r\n\r\nFinally, the PR also introduces initial unit tests for PeerManager that make use of a mocked `ConnectionsInterface` instead of the actual CConnman.\r\n\r\nLooking for conceptual & approach review.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is not super polished so I would expect the CI to fail but I will break this up and polish if there is enough conceptual support. I will not keep this rebased as the general architectural direction this is taking should be clear in any case.",

Our addnode logic usually connects the addnode peers before the automatic outbound logic does, but not always, as a connection race can occur (see mainnet examples in the commit message). When an addnode peer is connected as an automatic outbound peer and is the only connection we have to a network, it can be protected by our new outbound network-specific eviction logic and persist in the \"wrong role\". Fix these issues by checking if the selected address is an addnode peer in our automatic outbound connection logic.\r\n\r\nUpdate the p2p logging with the improvements that allowed seeing/understanding/debugging the current behavior.

          "body": "Depends on #28199, please review that first.\r\n\r\nThis is milestone 1 of package relay p2p changes. See #27463 for full project tracking.\r\n\r\nPlease see #27742 for how this PR fits into the big picture. I strongly suggest that reviewers look at that PR first to decide if they are comfortable with the overall approach.\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly refactors, with a few behavior changes and improvements:\r\n- Introduces `TxDownloadManager`, which handles all transaction downloading. It contains the `TxRequestTracker`, `TxOrphanage`, and filters for `AlreadyHaveTx`.\r\n- Updates logs for tx {validation, relay, orphans} to include both txid and wtxid when possible.\r\n- Adds a new log category, `TXPACKAGES`. Logging in the orphanage is changed from `MEMPOOL` to `TXPACKAGES`.\r\n- Adds support for tracking when multiple peers provided the same tx in the orphanage.\r\n- Makes `TxDownloadManager` responsible for tracking the orphans we need to resolve and deciding how/when to resolve them.\r\n- Adds all announcers of an orphan as potential resolution candidates. This tracker is a `TxDownloadManager` which helps us schedule requests.\r\n   - In this PR, \"orphan resolution\" means requesting missing parents by `getdata(MSG_TX | MSG_WITNESS_FLAG, missing_txid)`.\r\n    - In a future PR, we'll add another resolution method, requesting ancestor wtxids using `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO, orphan_wtxid)`.",
