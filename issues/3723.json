    "title": "mempool superblock redesign",
    "body": "One of the proposals floated about, originally from Gavin or @sipa IIRC, was modelling the mempool after a \"superblock.\"  This idea seems to elegantly solve a few problems.\n\nModel the memory pool as one big block, whose size is constrained to X 1MB blocks.  This super-block is sorted according to default bitcoind block-building rules: fee per kB, with a little area for under-fee (zero fee) high priority transactions.  Any newly arriving transaction is either (a) added to the memory pool, possibly triggering removal of other transactions, or (b) dropped and not relayed.\n\nThis would seem to deal with spam dynamically, as transactions would drop off the low end of the superblock.  This also effectively caps the size of the memory pool, reducing DoS attack surface.  And, it plays into transaction lifetime work (#3722).\n",

          "body": "Sparked by another discussion (#3721), it seemed useful to open an issue on transaction expiration.\n\nIt has been my longstanding contention that transaction lifetimes should be more deterministic. If a transaction does not confirm within a set period, the mempool should forget it, rather than accumulating garbage and leaving the transaction in limbo.\n\nOne proposal bandied about on IRC is to expire any transaction from the memory pool, that does not confirm within X blocks.  Proposed value for X is 2 days, 144*2.\n\nIt is always the responsibility of the client to retransmit a transaction until it is confirmed.  If a client ceases retransmission, and waits X blocks, they have a reasonable chance of presuming the network has forgotten the transaction [assuming the network has mostly upgraded]. That enables the client to recover the dead transaction, including double-spending with a higher fee.\n\nThis seems to accomplish two useful goals:  preventing the mempool from accumulating garbage, and making transaction lifetime more deterministic [within a certain probability].\n\nRelated: mempool superblock redesign (#3723).\n",

The new fee after this patch is 0.5 cents.\n\nMiners who prefer the higher fees are obviously still able to\nuse the command line flags to override this setting. Miners who\nchoose to create smaller blocks will select the highest-fee paying\ntransactions anyway.\n\nThis would hopefully be the last manual adjustment ever required\nbefore floating fees become normal.\n",

I personally have been lurking on the Bitcoin github repository, just hoping for this proposal to find acceptance.\n\nNot only would this proposal fix a lot of DoS & scalability issues. You could also decide to replace an old transaction in the superblock if a new transaction has the same inputs, but higher priority. At first glance, this will mitigate the problem of transactions getting stuck in the mempool.\n\nHowever, it would also be a really good way to have dynamic fees, as planned, work even better.\n",

I'm just tired of all the 'waiting for the devs' passivity.\n\nAs for the proposal I think this is a good approach overall. One danger is that the relaying/mempool rules are no longer predictable, and will very per node as well as over time. But on the other hand I think that's unavoidable. Even currently there are differences between nodes due to the version. \n\nIt means that clients have to adapt and cope with non-relaying and non-confirming transactions better.\n",
