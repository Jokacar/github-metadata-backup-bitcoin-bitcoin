It builds both the stable and HEAD branches successfully, has a self-contained `berkeleydb4` to get around the issues you raise in the build documentation, and can build everything from only the command-line interface to the whole suite.\n\nMy one issue with this recipe is that Bitcoin's configure script can't find the specialised BDB4, even when the `$PATH` is prepended to point to it, and consequently I had to use the `\"--with-incompatible-bdb\"` option which removes the portability of the wallet. With some minor tweaks to your configure script I'm pretty sure you could get it to build with accepting this internal BDB4 though.\n\n_(Side note, If you wanted to go all out you could theoretically actually use a Homebrew recipe to build your .dmg releases as well automatically, using the 10.7 SDK, including building internally all the dependencies, but that's a whole other ballgame we can talk about if desired later)._\n\nAnyway, If you want it, here it is. If not, never mind :grinning:.\n",
