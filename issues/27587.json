    "title": "Libbitcoinkernel Project Tracking",
    "body": "#### Project Board: https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/projects/3\r\n\r\nThis is the tracking issue for the `libbitcoinkernel` project. The original tracking issue is found in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303. This issue contains much of the content written by Carl Dong in the original issue but is more regularly updated.\r\n\r\nThe libbitcoinkernel project is a new attempt at extracting our consensus engine. The kernel part of the name highlights one of the key functional differences from libbitcoinconsensus and in fact, most libraries: it is a stateful library that can spawn threads, do caching, do I/O, and many other things that one may not normally expect from a library.\r\n\r\nThis statefulness is necessary for libbitcoinkernel's decidedly incremental approach to extracting our consensus engine. This approach favors:\r\n\r\n1. Reusing existing code\r\n...which allows us to be continually integrated with Bitcoin Core and benefit from our extensive test suite\r\n    \r\n2. Incremental decoupling instead of building from scratch\r\n ...which allows us to avoid having to prematurely optimize for a \"perfect\" boundary or API (tends to be highly subjective, non-obvious, may lead to unproductive bike-shedding before we've even done anything meaningful)\r\n\r\nThe work of extracting our consensus engine into a library and making the API ergonomic is likely to be a multi-release project involving multiple contributors. The incremental approach takes this into account and respects the sheer size of work (both in writing code and getting it through review) that needs to be undertaken.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\nPlease see the project board: https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/projects/3\r\n\r\n## The Game Plan\r\n\r\n* [ ] Stage 1\r\n    * [x] Step 1\r\n    * [x] Step 2\r\n    * [ ] Step 3\r\n    * [ ] Step 4\r\n* [ ] Stage 2\r\n\r\n### Stage 1: Extracting out a usable `libbitcoinkernel.{so,dylib,dll}`\r\n#### Step 1: Introduce internal `bitcoin-chainstate` and `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. What `.cpp` files do we need?\r\n\r\nThis `bitcoin-chainstate` executable uses our consensus engine and its build system code revealed the minimal set of files needed to link in to use the consensus engine as-is. It is important to note that this list of files will serve as a guiding \"North Star\" for this first stage of the plan: as more and more modules of the codebase are decoupled from the consensus engine, the list will grow shorter and shorter.\r\n\r\nThis list of files (the `_SOURCES` in `Automake` speak) then serves as the basis for a `libbitcoinkernel`, which `bitcoin-chainstate` will be linked against.\r\n\r\n**Key Result:** Any further coupling of our consensus engine with non-consensus modules will result in linker errors, preventing this project from becoming a Sisyphean task of battling coupling regressions.\r\n#### Step 2: Decouple most non-consensus code from `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. Prune the unnecessary `.cpp` files (and their respective headers)!\r\n\r\nIn this step many modules were removed from the `libbitcoinkernel` that do not logically belong in `libbitcoinkernel` (e.g. `index/*.cpp`, `netaddress.cpp`), but are nevertheless necessary to be included in its `_SOURCES` for `bitcoin-chainstate` to link correctly.\r\n\r\n**Developer Note:** We do not decouple the mempool _yet_ because most users of `libbitcoinkernel` may want to have an embedded mempool with Bitcoin Core's policies and we can decouple it later. This stage is more about extracting obvious non-kernel functionality, like argument parsing, or shutdown handling, than it is about extracting Bitcoin Core specific functionality like assumevalid, assumeutxo, checkpoints, or the mempool. Such extractions fall under stage 2.\r\n\r\nCompleting handling of the shutdown code might run parallel to the remaining steps, or even extend to stage 2. The problem is that a user of the library might trigger a fatal error, without the function returning an error code. The user might then call further functions, which could be unsafe.\r\n\r\n#### Step 3: Decouple most non-consensus headers from `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. Prune the unnecessary `.h` files!\r\n\r\nThe goal of this step is to allow users of the `libbitcoinkernel` to include its header files without having to include headers of external dependencies, platform-specific definitions, or non-consensus related definitions. Pruning _all_ non-consensus related code from the headers is not the goal of this step though, and falls more towards stage 2 of the project. The reason for this is that pruning all these headers without having a clear API goal in mind would lead to scope creep.\r\n\r\nSimilar to Stage 1 Step 2, this entails lots of small decoupling of the header dependency tree. A notable piece of this step is to remove `leveldb` includes from our headers to avoid needing to re-ship `leveldb` headers. Another is removing the `boost` multiindex includes currently required by our mempool headers.\r\n\r\n* [x] Prune boost/signal headers\r\n* [x] Prune leveldb headers\r\n* [ ] Prune boost/multiindex headers\r\n* [ ] Prune clientversion.h\r\n* [ ] Prune protocol.h\r\n* [ ] Prune netaddress.h\r\n* [ ] Prune bitcoin-config.h\r\n* [ ] Prune compat.h\r\n* [x] Prune univalue includes\r\n\r\n#### Step 4: Use the `libbitcoinkernel` library for internal compilation\r\n\r\nNow that `libbitcoinkernel` contains some minimal set of source files, it should also be used as an internal library for `libbitcoin_node`. The desired library organization is shown in [doc/design/libraries.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/libraries.md).\r\n\r\n### Stage 2: Polishing the API / Continual De-coupling\r\n\r\nAt this point, we have a usable `libbitcoinkernel` that is _somewhat_ minimally linked. However, it has a very idiosyncratic, Bitcoin Core-specific C++ interface. The goal of this stage is to incrementally make the `libbitcoinkernel` API more ergonomic for users outside of Bitcoin Core. Bindings to other languages (first C, then others) should be introduced. Note though, that there is a possible dichotomy here between optimizing the library interface for external users and for the internal interface within Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nIt is crucial that multiple contributors collaboratively lead this stage. Ideally, they would be able to work with users looking to integrate with `libbitcoinkernel` who can give an accurate account of the API ergonomics from the library user's point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting `libbitcoinkernel` Through Review\r\n\r\nThe following ground rules were proposed to make this process more streamlined for all parties involved and a few things this tracking issue can help with:\r\n\r\n1. Any outstanding comments/reviews not pertinent to the main thrust of PRs should not delay/block the merging of the core functionality of PRs. Any leftover comments/reviews not tackled in the PR will be taken note of in the TODO section below and then either triaged in an issue or addressed in a separate PR.     \r\n2. Whenever the PR reaches a stage where there are only leftover comments/reviews left, the author should make a comment saying so. This might make it easier for maintainers to determine roughly where the PR is at in its lifecycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Action Items\r\n\r\n1. If you have any questions, please post them below!\r\n 2. If you plan on reviewing `libbitcoinkernel` or are a maintainer:       \r\n       1. Please make sure you've read the \"Getting `libbitcoinkernel` Through Review\" section above.\r\n       2. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help streamline the review process.\r\n3. If you have any ideas for the future direction of \"Stage 2: Polishing the API / Continual De-coupling\", please leave a comment below, I'd love to talk!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Project-wide TODOs\r\n\r\nThese are suggestions for further cleanup and improvements that came up during review:\r\n\r\n* [ ]  Various followups for [[kernel 2c/n] Introduce `kernel::Context`, encapsulate global init/teardown #25065](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065)\r\n  * [ ]  Marco's post-merge review comments: [[kernel 2c/n] Introduce `kernel::Context`, encapsulate global init/teardown #25065 (review)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065#pullrequestreview-996614232)\r\n  * [ ]  Cory's `kernel::Context` cleanup suggestions: [[kernel 2c/n] Introduce `kernel::Context`, encapsulate global init/teardown #25065 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25065#discussion_r882182549)\r\n* [ ]  Russell's post-merge review comment: [[kernel 2e/n] miner: Make `mempool` optional, stop constructing temporary empty mempools #25223 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25223#discussion_r898164322)\r\n* [ ]  Various followups for [[kernel 3a/n] Decouple `CTxMemPool` from `ArgsManager` #25290](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290)\r\n  * [ ]  Perform gArgs checking in `ApplyArgsManOptions`: [[kernel 3a/n] Decouple `CTxMemPool` from `ArgsManager` #25290 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290#discussion_r907535652)\r\n  * [ ]  Perform `CTxMemPool::Options` checking in `CTxMemPool` constructor: [[kernel 3a/n] Decouple `CTxMemPool` from `ArgsManager` #25290 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290#discussion_r900272797)\r\n  * [x]  ~Change `CalculateMemPoolAncestors` to take in `CTxMemPool::Limits` instead: [[kernel 3a/n] Decouple `CTxMemPool` from `ArgsManager` #25290 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290#discussion_r905260891)~\r\n* [ ]  Various followups for [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487)\r\n  * [x] ~Improve `DumpMempool`'s mutex: [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r916228022).~ Won't fix, see [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r923360777).\r\n  * [ ]  Change `LoadMempool`'s semantics: [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r916044902)\r\n  * [ ]  Make LoadMempool less foot-gunny: [[kernel 3b/n] Decouple `{Dump,Load}Mempool` from `ArgsManager` #25487 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487#discussion_r921234107), [c4249c1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/c4249c1243981f42091950d1295c2be6bd4bf118)\r\n* [ ] Various followups for [refactor, kernel: Decouple ArgsManager from blockstorage #27125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125)\r\n  * [ ] Martin's request for a follow-up fixing the docstring: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125#discussion_r1190350876\r\n* [ ]  Followups for [kernel: Remove util/system from kernel library, interface_ui from validation #27636](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636)\r\n  * [ ] Cory's request for cleaning up the kernel interface functions of pointer and reference types: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1202937682\r\n  * [ ] Russell's request for eliminating the BlockNotify signal: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1193904693\r\n  \r\n#### Other various items that arose during review and should be tracked\r\n* Marco's request for a minimal iwyu memory include false positive example: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125#discussion_r1184832621\r\n* Marcos' request for unrolling the reindex loop: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125#discussion_r1183633068\r\n* Marco's request for getting rid of exceptions in the `ArgsManager`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27491#discussion_r1189586654\r\n* Russell's request for getting rid of `fWarned`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1193969953",

What `.h` files do we need?\r\n\r\nBefore this step, `bitcoin-chainstate` has been an internal executable managed by our build system with access to all files and headers. In this step, we add an external `bitcoin-chainstate` with a separate build system to reveal the minimal set of headers we need to ship in order to make the `libbitcoinkernel` library usable.\r\n\r\n#### Step 4: Decouple most non-consensus headers from `libbitcoinkernel`\r\n##### a.k.a. Prune the unnecessary `.h` files!\r\n\r\nSimilar to Step 2, there are lots of small decoupling of the header dependency tree here. A notable piece of this step is to remove `leveldb` includes from our headers to avoid needing to re-ship `leveldb` headers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stage 2: Polishing the API / Continual De-coupling\r\n\r\nAt this point, we have a usable `libbitcoinkernel` that is _somewhat_ minimally linked. However, it has a very idiosyncratic, Bitcoin Core-specific C++ interface. The goal of this stage is to incrementally make the `libbitcoinkernel` API more ergonomic for users outside of Bitcoin Core. Bindings to other languages (first C, then others) should be introduced.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have near-zero experience with library API design and langauge bindings, so I think ***it would be wise for other contributors to lead this stage***. Ideally, they would be able to work with users looking to integrate with `libbitcoinkernel` who can give an accurate account of the API ergonomics from the library user's point of view. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting `libbitcoinkernel` Through Review\r\n\r\nMost of the changes to be made are \"move only\", but there are a lot of these \"move only\" changes to be made. Of course comments/reviews regarding correctness are always more than welcome, but I want very much to avoid losing momentum on this project because of style or style-adjacent comments/reviews.\r\n\r\nI propose the following ground rules to make this process more streamlined for all parties involved and a few things that I can do to help:\r\n\r\n1. Any outstanding comments/reviews not pertinent to the main thrust of PRs should not delay/block the merging of the core functionality of PRs. I will make sure to open a separate issue tracking all the leftover comments/reviews so that they won't be missed and can be addressed one by one.\r\n2. Whenever the PR reaches a stage where there are only leftover comments/reviews left, I will make a comment saying so. This might make it easier for maintainers to determine roughly where the PR is at in its lifecycle (ofc don't trust me, verify :smile:).\r\n\r\n## Action Items\r\n\r\n1. If you have any questions, please post them below!\r\n2. If you plan on reviewing `libbitcoinkernel` or are a maintainer:\r\n    1. Please make sure you've read the \"Getting `libbitcoinkernel` Through Review\" section above.\r\n    2. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help streamline the review process.\r\n3. If you would like to take the lead on \"Stage 2: Polishing the API / Continual De-coupling\", please leave a comment below, I'd love to talk!",

As a standalone library the libbitcoinkernel should not have to rely on code that accesses shutdown state through a global. Instead, replace it with an interrupt class that is owned by the kernel context. Additionally this moves the remaining usages of the `uiInterface` out of the kernel code. The process of moving the `uiInterface` out of the kernel was started in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken here uses the notification interface to externalize the existing shutdown code from the kernel library. The `SignalInterrupt` kernel context member is passed by reference to the `ChainstateManager` to allow for the termination of long-running kernel functions and sending interrupt signals.\r\n",

This PR also drops the last reference to the `uiInterface` global in kernel code. The process of moving the `uiInterface` out of the kernel was started in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636.\r\n\r\nThis pull request contains a subset of patches originally proposed in #27711. It will be part of a series of changes required to make handling of interrupts (or in other words the current shutdown procedure) in the kernel library more transparent and less reliable on global mutable state. The set of patches contained here was originally proposed by @ryanofsky [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27711#issuecomment-1580779869). ",

However, leveldb-specific functionality should be abstracted by the `dbwrapper` and does not need to be available to the rest of the code. Having leveldb included in a widely-used header such as `dbwrapper.h` bloats the entire project's header tree.\r\n\r\nThe `dbwrapper` is a key component of the libbitcoinkernel library. Future users of this library would not want to contend with  having the leveldb headers exposed and potentially polluting their project's namespace.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the leveldb headers are removed from the `dbwrapper` by moving leveldb-specific code to the implementation file and creating a [pimpl](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl) where leveldb member variables are indispensable. As a final step, the leveldb include flags are removed from the `BITCOIN_INCLUDES` and moved to places where the dbwrapper is compiled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis pull request is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587), and more specifically its stage 1 step 3 \"Decouple most non-consensus headers from libbitcoinkernel\".",

          "title": "RFC: Remove boost usage from kernel api / headers",
          "body": "Similarly to #28327 I wanted to open this PR to receive some opinions and better approaches.\r\n\r\nThe kernel library is currently at the stage where unwanted headers are removed from its set of headers. In practice, this means we are reducing the number of includes that are required for compiling the experimental `bitcoin-chainstate` binary. This is described in stage 1 step 3 of the [project tracking issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).\r\n\r\nCurrently the mempool is part of the kernel library. The mempool headers include the boost multi index headers. Thus any application wanting to use the kernel library and its headers will have to include the boost headers too. This is not only undesirable because of the sheer size of these headers, but also might lead to conflicts if the including application uses a different boost version.\r\n\r\nIn the approach laid out by this PR, mempool member variables and methods are declared in the header without having to include boost by either wrapping them in a struct and [pimpling](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl) them, or making methods static implementation functions. The boost definitions are gathered into separate header (`mempool_set_definitions.h`) that is only included by implementation files that require definitions of the boost types. This allows us to retain the current architecture with roughly the same interfaces. \r\n\r\nThe approach laid out by this PR also has some, albeit small, compilation speed and size benefits. Averaged over a few of compilation runs I consistently observe faster compilation by a couple of seconds and some smaller pre-processed and compiled object sizes. The main detractor of this method is obviously the number of lines touched. However it also has the benefit of inventorizing all the files that require direct access to the mempool data structures as well getting rid of boost multi index includes in non-kernel implementation files that include the mempool, but don't directly manipulate its data structures (e.g. wallet.cpp).\r\n\r\nA much simpler alternative approach, at least on the surface, would be removing all `txmempool.h` includes from kernel library headers (see [this branch](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/mempoolBoostSimple)). Currently this is only `validation.h`.  Due to the mutex member of `CTxMemPool` and the correspondingly defined lock decorators on the chainstate methods this becomes a bit more complicated though and I am not sure how this might be possible with the current architecture.\r\n\r\nA discussion of how and if to remove the mempool from the kernel library has so far been intentionally punted to the next stage of the kernel library development. Pimpling the mempool itself precludes this discussion, since the library could never be shipped with the `CTxMemPool` headers. Pimpling the mempool members (like done in this PR) might also make a future splitting of block and mempool validation logic into separate compilation units easier.",
