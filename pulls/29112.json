    "body": "The way that we have configured SQLite to run means that only one database transaction can be open at a time. Typically, each individual read and write operation will be its own transaction that is opened and committed automatically by SQLite. However, sometimes we want these operations to be batched into a multi-statement transaction, so `SQLiteBatch::TxnBegin`, `SQLiteBatch::TxnCommit`, and `SQLiteBatch::TxnAbort` are used to manage the transaction of the database.\r\n\r\nHowever, once a db transaction is begun with one `SQLiteBatch`, any operations performed by another `SQLiteBatch` will also occur within the same transaction. Furthermore, those other `SQLiteBatch`s will not be expecting a transaction to be active, and will abort it once the `SQLiteBatch` is destructed. This is problematic as it will prevent some data from being written, and also cause the `SQLiteBatch` that opened the transaction in the first place to be in an unexpected state and throw an error.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this situation, we need to prevent the multiple batches from writing at the same time. Although SQLite does have facilities for doing that, they require the Write Ahead Log (WAL) mode, which is a feature that we explicitly chose to disable since it spread wallet data to multiple files. As such, we need to be handling the concurrency ourselves. To do so, I've implemented added a `CSemaphore` within `SQLiteDatabase` which will be used by any `SQLiteBatch` trying to do a write operation. `wait()` is called by `TxnBegin`, and at the beginning of `WriteKey`, `EraseKey`, and `ErasePrefix`. `post()` is called in `TxnCommit`, `TxnAbort` and at the end of `WriteKey`, `EraseKey`, and `ErasePrefix`. To avoid deadlocking on ` TxnBegin()` followed by a `WriteKey()`, `SQLiteBatch will now also track whether a transaction is in progress so that it knows whether to use the semaphore.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not a problem for BDB wallets since BDB uses WAL and provides transaction objects that must be used if an operation is to occur within a transaction. Specifically, we either pass a transaction pointer, or a nullptr, to all BDB operations, and this allows for concurrent transactions so it doesn't have this problem.\r\n\r\nFixes #29110",

To be able to use `createwalletdescriptor` with the other address types, we need a way to change the wallet extended key, and so `sethdseed` has been updated and enabled for descriptor wallets. As with legacy wallets, when called without parameters, it will generate a new random master key for the wallet. It can also take a xprv and set that as the master key. It still takes a BIP 32 seed as WIF or as hex as we do for legacy wallets. The seed will be transformed into and stored as a BIP 32 extended key. The latter is to give us greater compatibility with other wallets which often produce non-WIF HD seeds.\r\n\r\nSplit from #25907",

          "body": "A couple of users have requested that we support wallets that encrypt everything, even if the wallet is watch-only, in order to have better privacy if the wallet is stolen. This PR introduces an `EncryptedDatabase` backend for the wallet which encrypts/decrypts each key-value record individually before reading from or writing to the database.\r\n\r\n`EncryptedDatabase` is only supported for SQLite databases and descriptor wallets. This was done in order to have an easier way to get downgrade protection that also does not involve writing an existing record in plaintext (e.g. `minversion` or `flags`). SQLite has a fixed field \"application id\" that we already use for cross-network protection. This is reused to detect if a sqlite database is an encrypted wallet, and thus it prevents older software from attempting to open such wallets.\r\n\r\nIn order to read records from the database, `EncryptedDatabase` will cache the decrypted key in memory so that it can lookup the encrypted key in the database. Values will always be decrypted when read.\r\n\r\nThe encryption scheme is the same one that we use for encrypting private keys. It's not that great, but I didn't feel like re-implementing it, and it seems good enough. The encryption key itself is encrypted with the passphrase and stored in a new record.\r\n\r\nWallets with encrypted databases cannot be loaded on start. They can only be loaded by explicit user action through `loadwallet` which now has a `db_passphrase` parameter to allow the decryption of these wallets. `createwallet` also has a `db_passphrase` to create these wallets. For now, there is no way to encrypt the database after it has been created, nor is there a way to change the passphrase.",
