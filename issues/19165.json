      "body": "> @Gchowdhury1988 : The weird thing is: The BTC client does not hang completely. It still runs, but its GUI is veeeery unresponsive all the time. With enough patience it still syncs to the network and after some days it is \"up to date\".\r\n> I still miss a real explanation what BTC does differently than Lightcoin or Dogecoin, whose clients run without any problems on the same USB harddrive. (And of course: **Why** does the GUI hang when there are blocking disk I/O operations? I'd expect that disk I/O is done via async operations and/or in different threads).\r\n\r\n-\r\nSo what you are saying is that after over a year of this issue being open it is still unresolved. My best course of action to run a node is therefore to setup a dedicated raspi blitz? My Mac Mini which I otherwise bought primarily to run a node, isn't functional for anything else if all the storage is used up! :( \r\n\r\nThanks for writing back. ",
