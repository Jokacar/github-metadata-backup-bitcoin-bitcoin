    "body": "This is joint work with amitiuttarwar.\r\n\r\nSee issue #28462 for a broader discussion on increasing the number of block-relay-only connections independent of this particular implementation proposal.\r\n\r\nWe suggest to increase the number of inbound slots allocated to block-relay-only peers by increasing the default maximum connections from 125 to 200, with 50% of inbound slots accessible for tx-relaying peers.\r\nThis is a prerequisite for being able to increase the default number of outgoing block-relay-only peers later, because the current inbound capacity of the network is not sufficient.\r\nIn order to account for incoming tx-relaying peers separately from incoming block-relay peers, changes to the inbound eviction logic are necessary.\r\n\r\nSee the next post in this thread for a more detailed explanation and motivation of the changes.",

      "body": "### Status Quo\r\nWe have a default maximum of 125 connections (not counting manual ones). Out of these, \r\n11 (8 full outbounds, 2 block-relay-only, 1 feeler) are reserved for outbounds, leaving us with \r\n114 inbound slots. There are currently no limits on how many of the inbounds can support transaction relay.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nWe want to increase the number of inbound slots specifically offered to block-relay-only connections, but don't want to significantly change the number of tx-relaying inbound peers, because we don’t want to radically change the memory and traffic requirements that come with running a full node with the default configuration.\r\nThis is complicated by a timing issue: When a new peer connects to us, we don't know yet whether it is block-relay-only before we have processed their version message.\r\nInbound peer eviction, however, happens right after a peer connects to us and before processing its version msg. This means that we don't yet know during inbound eviction, if the new peer wants tx relay.\r\n\r\n### Approach\r\nWe propose to introduce a separate maximum of tx-relaying inbound connections, in addition to the existing global maximum.\r\nThe new maximum for tx-relaying inbounds gets chosen such that 50% of the total inbound slots can be utilized by tx-relaying peers. We choose a ratio here instead of a fixed number here so that it scales with users changing their `-maxconnections` value from the default. The ratio of 50% is also made adjustable in the form of a new startup parameter. \r\n\r\n### Changes to the eviction logic\r\nWe don't change the eviction logic for total connections, which happens in `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()`.\r\nWe add a tx-relay-specific eviction check to the version message processing which runs if we don't have capacity for another tx-relaying peer: This check uses the same logic from `AttemptToEvictConnection`, but specifically evicts only tx-relaying peers (by protecting the rest of the peers). Only if we cannot find another peer to evict (e.g. all peers are protected, which should only happen if a low `-maxconnections` is used) we disconnect the new peer. This approach achieves that the number of tx-relaying peers can never exceed the limit.\r\n\r\n### Numbers\r\nSpecifically, we propose to increase the total number of connections from 125 to 200, with a  suggested ratio of 50% tx-relay inbounds. With 11 connection slots reserved for outbound peers, \r\nthis results in (200 - 11) * 0.5 = 94.5 slots for tx-relaying inbound peers, which closely aligns with the typical tx-relaying inbounds seen in today's world, where typically ~20% of inbound slots are already taken by block-relay-only connections.\r\nThese numbers were chosen to be sufficient to raise the number of block-relay-only connections from 2 to 8 once this patch is widely deployed (see Issue #28462 for more details on this).\r\n[Note: In a previous iteration, a ratio of 60% was suggested, see [this post](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28463#issuecomment-1872227505) for more discussion.]\r\n\r\n### Handling bloom filter peers\r\nThe logic gets a bit complicated if a node supports BIP37 (bloom filters), because then an inbound peer can be switched to tx-relay after sending a `FILTERLOAD` or `FILTERCLEAR` message (but never back!), which could result in an excess of tx-relaying inbounds. We propose to solve this by triggering the eviction logic for a tx-relaying peer from `net_processing` whenever we switch a peer to tx-relay due to a BIP37-related message.\r\n",

          "body": "## tldr:\r\nBlock-relay-only connections help improve partition resistance on the bitcoin network by increasing connectivity while obfuscating the network graph. To be conservative and reduce chances of unexpected network effects, initially 2 outbound block-relay-only connections per node were introduced. Since then, we have improved resource utilization and network behaviors to work towards increasing that number. Now, let’s try and do it!\r\n\r\nThis is joint work with mzumsande. #28463 proposes a specific implementation to increase the number of inbound slots for block-relay-only connections, which is a prerequisite to later increase the outbound slots. This issue is a place to discuss any conceptual questions or concerns.\r\n\r\n## History & Context: \r\nIn 2019, PR [#15759](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759) introduced 2 outbound block-relay-only connections for bitcoind nodes. The primary motivation of introducing these connections was to help obfuscate the network graph, since leaked information could help an adversary execute a partition attack. \r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, there was open questioning around how many block-relay-only connections we should add. More increases robustness but effects to consider include resource utilization and addr relay implications. Introducing 2 extra connections was evaluated to be a good first step that balanced tangible benefits with potential risk. gmaxwell mentioned in [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-480400958), “ultimately I'd like to optimize memory usage for both inbound and outbound blocksonly links, then at least double the inbound connection limit for blocks only links, and make 8 blocks only links.” @sdaftuar expressed agreement with this direction [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-480868516).\r\n\r\nAt the time, there were a few different mechanisms that would be a cause for concern if the number of block-relay-only connections were increased. Many have been resolved since and we have highlighted one significant question that needs to be evaluated in the context of this proposal. Additionally, reviewers should consider if there may be any other undesirable side effects. \r\n- Addrman interactions (fixed) [PR #20187](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20187): There were a couple of nuanced interactions between block-relay-only connections and addrman that were addressed in this PR. The changes fix a privacy leak, ensure block-relay-only addresses are recognized as reliable connections, and fix a pre-existing addrman bug around active connections. \r\n- Addr relay implications (fixed) [PR #21528](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528): As @ajtowns described in [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-527012757), introducing block-relay-only connections initially degraded the propagation of addr messages on the network. [PR #21528](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528) reduces addr blackholes by improving the behavior for honest nodes. The default behavior was updated to not treat inbound connections as addr relay peers until they indicated interest by initiating an address related p2p message. \r\n- Memory utilization (fixed) [PR #22778](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22778): block-relay-only connections do not require as much memory as transaction relay peers. They don’t need a `TxRelay` data structure, which is significant because the tx relay bloom filter uses approximately 500kb per peer. [PR #22778](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22778) allowed nodes to identify whether an inbound peer might ever relay transactions over the lifetime of the connection, and stop initializing the TxRelay data structure when unnecessary. \r\n- Netgroup limitation (fixed) [PR #27374](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27374): In certain circumstances, the logic to diversify netgroups of our outbound connections was limiting the total number of connections permitted by the node. This PR fixed this issue by applying separate logic for clearnet peers vs privacy network peers. \r\n- Number of available connection slots on the network (OPEN): available connection slots are a shared and limited network resource. Increasing the defaults for outbound connections should be carefully calibrated against the expected values for inbound slots over time. The next section shares context for how numbers have been selected for our proposal, and this is an area where we are very interested in reviewer feedback. \r\n- Is there anything else we are missing? \r\n\r\n\r\n## Availability of Connection Slots: \r\n#### Context \r\nThe patch in #28463 proposes values based on observing network statistics & calculating expected memory utilization. This section provides more reasoning behind selecting those numbers, so reviewers can evaluate the methodology.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental question is: how much do we need to increase inbound capacity to accommodate for increasing the number of outbounds from 10 to 16. This is tricky to answer with precision because (1) estimating the number of non-reachable nodes is hard and (2) these numbers will inevitably change over time, and we want to accommodate for fluctuations. \r\n\r\nThere is no way to guarantee sufficient connection slots - if all users disabled inbounds, the network would fail. However, we can still observe network behaviors to build confidence around projecting likely proportions that would be maintained over time. After all, the default number of 8 outbound connections dates back to [satoshi code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/94cfec07fd302c9ff9b6a80c47418d4fe56596ae) from 2010, and has successfully held up over the years 🙂\r\n\r\n#### Estimating the number of reachable clearnet nodes (per sept 2023)\r\n6155 ([bitnodes](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/))\r\n8509 ([KIT](https://www.dsn.kastel.kit.edu/bitcoin/data/churn0-v.gpd))\r\n3862 ([Luke Dashjr](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/historical.html))\r\n7910 ([21 Ninja](https://21.ninja/reachable-nodes/nodes-by-net-type/))\r\n\r\nQuality of data: The bitnodes number is verifiable because peers can be queried, and a random sampling has demonstrated a high probability of successfully connecting. Luke Dashjr reports significantly lower than the other two, but the methodology is not disclosed. The data from 21 Ninja also clearly specifies its methodology and crawler code.\r\n\r\n#### Estimating the number of non-reachable clearnet nodes \r\n50956 ([Luke](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/historical.html), sept 2023, unknown methodology and included networks)\r\n32300 ([KIT Addr Spam Paper](https://www.dsn.kastel.kit.edu/publications/2022-Bitcoin-Degree.pdf) 07/21, estimated from the degrees calculated from observed addr spam)\r\n27000 - 35000 ([KIT Monitoring Paper](https://fc22.ifca.ai/preproceedings/114.pdf) 12/21, estimated from the number of gossip addrs received)\r\n35000 ([bitnodes](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes), estimated from gossip addrs received)\r\n\r\nQuality of data: Both KIT methods don’t take into account nodes that don’t self-advertise (e.g. listen=0, or SPV clients) but do permit inbound slots. Estimating based on addr gossip is going to include many spam addresses, so may provide a reasonable upper bound.\r\n\r\n#### Extrapolating numbers\r\nLet’s use rough estimates of 8,000 reachable clearnet nodes & 40,000 non-reachable nodes. \r\n\r\nEstimated slots required for each increment to the default number of outbound connections: 48,000. \r\nRequired additional inbound slots for each increment to default outbounds: 48000/8000 = 6.\r\n\r\nWith the current network estimates, we would need at least 6 additional inbound slots for each increment to the default number of outbounds. To be more conservative, we should probably add ~8-10 inbound slots for each additional outbound. \r\n\r\nThis is all only clearnet. However, it seems likely that inbound capacity for privacy networks are higher in comparison, because unlike clearnet, there is no need to unblock ports, so accepting inbounds is the default behavior. While node operators are able to easily disable those inbounds, we’d anticipate that to happen less frequently than on clearnet where the reverse effort is required. \r\n\r\n## Future work: \r\nWe need users to adopt the changes to increase the default for inbound block-relay-only connections before we can safely increase the default for outbounds. #28463 proposes the increase in inbounds. If these changes are accepted, we would want to wait until the corresponding release is widely adopted, then have a future release update the outbound default.\r\n\r\nAnchors were implemented using block-relay-only connections to mitigate against restart-based eclipse attacks. For more context see [issue #17326](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17326) & [PR #17428](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428). If we increase the number of outbound block-relay-only connections, we will want to thoughtfully design the interactions with anchors. As sdaftuar mentions in [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428#issuecomment-554073351), we will likely want to cap the anchors at 2, which entails selection logic. In [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213#issuecomment-1478551323), @brunoerg mentions the idea of having (at least) one anchor per network instead of just two generic ones. While discussing this in depth would be premature, we also want to keep these implications and options in mind as we advance the current work.",

          "body": "Closes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8798\r\n\r\nUse case: I run a full node that accepts inbound connections and have a `whitebind` setting so my personal light client can always connect, even when `maxconnections` (and particularly all inbound slots) is already full.\r\n\r\nCurrently when connections are full, if we receive an inbound peer request, we look for a current connection to evict so the new peer can have a slot. To find an evict-able peer we go through all our peers and \"protect\" multiple categories of peers, then we evict the \"worst\" peer that is left unprotected. If there are no peers left to evict, the inbound connection is denied.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, if the inbound connection has `forceinbound` permission we start the eviction process by first protecting all `noban` and outbound connections, then selecting one of the remaining peers (if any) at random. Then we loop through all our current connections, removing protected peers from the evict-able list. If we end up protecting all our remaining connections, the randomly chosen peer is evicted.\r\n\r\n`forceinbound` implies `noban` permission.\r\n\r\nAll outbound and `noban` connections remain protected from eviction.",

A possibility could be through a net permission flag, if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27114 makes it in.\"\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17167#issuecomment-1168606032 - \"This would allow us to use https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25355 when making outgoing connections to all nodes, except to whitelisted ones for which we would use our persistent I2P address.\"\r\n- Force-relay/mempool permissions for a node you intentionally connected to.\r\n",

Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670).\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I’ll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n* save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n* increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n* improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\n### How to review\r\n\r\nI suggest doing `make clean && autogen.sh && configure` before you try building it locally.",

          "body": "This PR introduces support for v2 P2P encryption(BIP 324) in the existing functional test framework and adds functional tests for the same.\r\n\r\n### commits overview\r\n1. introduces a new class `EncryptedP2PState` to store the keys, functions for performing the initial v2 handshake and encryption/decryption.\r\n3. this class is used by `P2PConnection` in inbound/outbound connections to perform the initial v2 handshake before the v1 version handshake. Only after the initial v2 handshake is performed do application layer P2P messages(version, verack etc..) get exchanged. (in a v2 connection)\r\n    - `v2_state` is the object of class `EncryptedP2PState` in `P2PConnection` used to store its keys, session-id etc.\r\n    - a node [advertising](https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md#advertising-to-support-v2-p2p) support for  v2 P2P is different from a node actually [supporting v2 P2P](https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md#supporting-v2-p2p) (differ when false advertisement of services occur)\r\n        - introduce a boolean variable `supports_v2_p2p` in `P2PConnection` to denote if it supports v2 P2P.\r\n        - introduce a boolean variable `advertises_v2_p2p` to denote whether `P2PConnection` which mimics peer behaviour advertises V2 P2P support. Default option is `False`.\r\n    - In the test framework, you can create Inbound and Outbound connections to `TestNode`\r\n        1. During **Inbound Connections**, `P2PConnection` is the initiator [`TestNode` <--------- `P2PConnection`]\r\n            - Case 1:\r\n                - if the `TestNode` advertises/signals v2 P2P support (means `self.nodes[i]` set up with `\"-v2transport=1\"`), different behaviour will be exhibited based on whether:\r\n                    1. `P2PConnection` supports v2 P2P\r\n                    2. `P2PConnection` does not support v2 P2P\r\n               - In a real world scenario, the initiator node would intrinsically know if they support v2 P2P based on whatever code they choose to run. However, in the test scenario where we mimic peer behaviour, we have no way of knowing if `P2PConnection` should support v2 P2P or not. So `supports_v2_p2p` boolean variable is used as an option to enable support for v2 P2P in `P2PConnection`.\r\n              - Since the `TestNode` advertises v2 P2P support (using \"-v2transport=1\"), our initiator `P2PConnection` would send:\r\n                1. (if the `P2PConnection` supports v2 P2P) ellswift + garbage bytes to initiate the connection\r\n                2. (if the `P2PConnection` does not support v2 P2P) version message to initiate the connection\r\n           - Case 2:\r\n                - if the `TestNode` doesn't signal v2 P2P support; `P2PConnection` being the initiator would send version message to initiate a connection.\r\n       2. During **Outbound Connections** [TestNode --------> P2PConnection]\r\n           - initiator `TestNode` would send:\r\n                - (if the `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P) ellswift + garbage bytes to initiate the connection\r\n                - (if the `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P) version message to initiate the connection\r\n          - Suppose `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P support when it actually doesn't support v2 P2P (false advertisement scenario)\r\n               - `TestNode` sends ellswift + garbage bytes\r\n               - `P2PConnection` receives but can't process it and disconnects.\r\n               - `TestNode` then tries using v1 P2P and sends version message\r\n               - `P2PConnection` receives/processes this successfully and they communicate on v1 P2P\r\n\r\n4. the encrypted P2P messages follow a different format - 3 byte length + 1-13 byte message_type + payload + 16 byte MAC\r\n5. includes support for testing decoy messages and v2 connection downgrade(using false advertisement - when a v2 node makes an outbound connection to a node which doesn't support v2 but is advertised as v2 by some malicious\r\nintermediary)\r\n\r\n### run the tests\r\n* functional test - `test/functional/p2p_v2_encrypted.py` `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py`\r\n\r\nI'm also super grateful to @ dhruv for his really valuable feedback on this branch.\r\nAlso written a more elaborate explanation here - https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md",

          "body": "This pull fixes several peer connection bugs in our p2p code, along with the logging that uncovered them:\r\n\r\n1. Fix detection of inbound peer connections in `GetAddedNodeInfo`.\r\n\r\n2. Fix addnode CJDNS peers not detected in `GetAddedNodeInfo`, causing `ThreadOpenAddedConnections` to continually retry to connect to them and RPC `getaddednodeinfo` incorrectly showing them as not connected.\r\n\r\n3. Fix `ThreadOpenConnections` not detecting inbound CJDNS connections and making automatic outbound connections to them.\r\n\r\n4. Fix detection of already connected peers in `AlreadyConnectedToAddress()`.\r\n\r\n5. Fix detection of already connected peers when making outbound connections in `ConnectNode`.\r\n\r\n6. Do not accept inbound connections in `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket` from I2P peers we're already connected to, as building I2P tunnels is expensive.\r\n\r\n7. Fix making automatic outbound connections in `ThreadOpenConnections` to addnode peers, in order not to allocate our limited outbound slots to them and to ensure addnode connections benefit from their intended protections. Our addnode logic usually connects the addnode peers before the automatic outbound logic does, but not always, as a connection race can occur (see the commit message for further details and mainnet examples). When an addnode peer is connected as an automatic outbound peer and is the only connection we have to a network, it can be protected by our new outbound network-specific eviction logic and persist in the \"wrong role\". Fix these issues by checking if the selected address is an addnode peer in our automatic outbound connection logic.\r\n\r\nUpdate the p2p logging with the improvements that allowed seeing/understanding/debugging the current behavior. Please see the commit messages for details.\r\n\r\nSimplify `MaybePickPreferredNetwork` to return `std::optional`, make it a const class method, and add Clang thread-safety analysis annotation and related assertions.\r\n",

This isn't done for the existing unconditional inobound eviction in `net` (`CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket`), because there we would evict a peer before adding the new peer to `m_nodes`.",

      "body": "overall, I like this approach significantly more. although we are introducing another touchpoint for inbound eviction logic, it is more straightforward to reason about. but the biggest improvement is not unnecessarily disconnecting a new or existing connection when tx relay isn't being requested.\r\n\r\nreviewed this in-depth. the fundamental structure & logic looks good to me. left a lot of comments along the way 😛\r\n\r\nsome additional thoughts:\r\n- commit message for ab5ad61f67f3bcab503ac3eb012c4f35d733b946 says \"When we receive an inbound connection and don't have space for another full-relay peer, we now attempt to evict specifically a full-relay inbound.\" I think this should mention timing of processing the version message for clarity.\r\n- the order of events when processing the `VERSION` message makes sense, because we want to instantiate `tx_relay` for the before before triggering the new eviction logic (which uses that in the count).\r\n- this code strengthens the distinction between inbound-tx-relay connections from inbound-block-relay connections. ideally, this would be captured in separate connection types, but that would require more invasive changes since we don't know the distinction at the time of accepting the connection. I don't think the benefit would be worth the cost, but is something worth keeping in mind if we continue to build stronger distinctions between the two types of inbounds. ",

This makes sense as we currently open 8 full-relay outbound and 2 block-relay outbound connections (ignoring feelers here). That's roughly 91 full-relay  and 23 block-relay inbound connections. With the new maximum of 113 that an increase of 22 full-relay inbound slots being used and nearly an increase of 25%. I'd argue that this is a significant change.",

You are right, in practice that amount will be lower because some block-relay-only connections are made to us. In that sense, the introduction of block-relay-only peers likely came with a reduction in bandwidth for popular nodes that were already at capacity before.\r\n\r\nOne way to accommodate this would be to reduce the percentage, so that there would only be ~90-100 slots for tx-relaying inbound peers instead of 113.",

This way, we'll be more aligned with the `typical` number of tx-relaying inbounds today, because nodes today usually have a significant number of block-relay-only inbounds as @0xB10C noted.\r\nThe previous number of 113 was aligned with the `maximum` number of tx-relaying inbounds.",

See #27534 for more background information.\r\n\r\nConsiderations from the previous draft:\r\n\r\n> Should we allow dimensions to be rearraged?\r\n> \r\n> When it comes time to gather up the RPC results, @vasild has provided an [alternate implementation](https://github.com/vasild/bitcoin/commits/getnetmsgstats) that uses an array instead of the MultiMap structure. This results in two changes:\r\n> \r\n>> using the stack over the heap (yay!)\r\n>> enforcing a strict ordering of dimensions (direction, network, connection type, message type)\r\n> \r\n> Aside from being good for memory, the reasoning here is allowing users to rearrange dimensions may be too confusing. I personally really like the ability to rearrange dimensions, which is why I have not integrated that solution into this PR, but am open to whatever the larger community prefers :) [Link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27534#issue-1685662150)\r\n\r\n^ I have looked at the alternative implementation (thanks @vasild!), but prefer the current version myself so long as the performance is not an issue. I've left this as-is for now. If folks here think that it might be an issue then I can investigate the alternative further. See the next consideration for additional reasoning on sticking with the current approach.\r\n\r\n> Now that an effort has been made to remove the friendship between CConnman and CNode (see this PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27257) I'm unsure if this (recording network stats on a CConnman object) belongs here. [Link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27534#discussion_r1179508199)\r\n\r\n^ These changes make @valid's alternative approach a bit harder to rebase and AB test with the current approach, as it relied on access to the `CNode` msg queue, and #27257 included the change: \"CNode's message processing queue is made private in the process and its mutex is turned into a non-recursive mutex.\" It can be worked around, but I'm not convinced it will be worth it.\r\n\r\n> this function should handle if index > NUM_NET_MESSAGE_TYPES [Link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27534#discussion_r1191793368)\r\n\r\n^ I took this suggestion as part in 800ec2ac762cb48ac667cdf04de263634404569e\r\n\r\n> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27534#discussion_r1191798171\r\n\r\n^ I refactored this array in c909dc5704465aa96ce4496ed14452719e0b7860 to make it more comprehensible in the source code.\r\n\r\nAdditional considerations from OP:\r\n\r\n* The code organisation was mainly taken care of by @satsie, with _src/netstats.{h\\|cpp}_ now code from the netstats namespace instead of being contained within _net.cpp_\r\n",

          "body": "#24748 added v2 transport to the python `P2PConnection`, but so far each test that wants to make use of it needs to enable it on an individual basis.\r\nThis PR changes it so that if the test suite is run with `--v2transport` option, v2 is used in each test by default, not only for connections between two bitcoind instances as before, but also wherever `P2PConnection` is used. Individual tests can override this global option.\r\n\r\nTo do that, a few tests need to be adjusted.\r\nIn addition, I added a commit to always use v1 in a few select subtests that send a large number of large messages (e.g. large reorgs). These tests don't have a fundamental problem with v2 but become very slow due to the unoptimised python ChaCha20 implementation (~30 minutes on my computer, so probably not suitable to be run in the CI).\r\n\r\nAs a result, `python3 test_runner.py --v2transport` should succeed and use `v2` everywhere (unless v1 is chosen explicitly).\r\n\r\n[Edit]: To make the \"test each commit\" CI pass, several test fixes were squashed into the last commit, which actually enables v2 p2p for `P2PConnection`. I have an unsquashed version at https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/tree/202401_bip324_alltests_unsquashed, in case that helps with review.\r\n\r\n",

          "title": "Broadcast own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections",
          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* Independent improvement (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29419):\r\n  * `log: deduplicate category names and improve logging.cpp`\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

Disconnection happens when incorrect garbage terminator is sent\r\n3. Disconnection happens when garbage bytes are tampered with\r\n4. Disconnection happens when AAD of first encrypted packet after the garbage terminator is not filled\r\n5. bitcoind ignores non-empty version packet and no disconnection happens\r\n\r\nAll these tests require a modified v2 P2P class (different from `EncryptedP2PState` used in `v2_p2p.py`) to implement our custom handshake behaviour based on different scenarios and have been kept in a single test file (`test/functional/p2p_v2_misbehaving.py`). Shifted the test in `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py` which is of the same pattern to this file too.",
