Also this code could probably be improved by updating unit tests to set nChainTx correctly, so the two special case conditions in the assert allowing `pindex->nChainTx == 0` could be dropped.",

For example, It also happens with `bitcoin-cli -regtest -generate 1` (after creating an empty wallet) on an empty datadir.\r\n\r\nI think the comment `// For testing, allow transaction counts to be completely unset.` is wrong. `CheckBlockIndex` traverses the entire block index tree, no matter if we have the block on disk or not. If we don't have it, `ReceivedBlockTransactions`  hasn't been called, and both `nTx` and `nChainTx` are 0.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the check `assert((pindex->nChainTx == pindex->nTx + prev_chain_tx)`  cannot be applied to headers for which we never processed the block data, and this has nothing to do with AssumeUtxo or Testing.\r\n\r\nI'll open a PR with a fix tomorrow unless someone disagrees.",

I think the condition `(pindex->nChainTx == pindex->nTx + prev_chain_tx)` should actually be true for all assumed-valid blocks except the first one and the last one, so that check could be tightened up\r\n\r\nAfter trying this out, I think that this is not the case. The `BLOCK_ASSUMED_VALID` status is only removed when the block is connected to the chain and raised to `BLOCK_VALID_SCRIPTS`. However, `nTx` and `nChainTx` are updated from their fake to their actual values in `AcceptBlock` / `ReceivedBlockTransactions`, which happens before that. So during the period where we receive blocks for the background chain in some, possibly random, order, there will be a mix of blocks with updated `nTx` and fake `nTx` ones, so that the condition could fail everywhere in the range of assumed-valid blocks.\r\n\r\n> * It might possible to add a test covering the assert failure that pindex->IsAssumedValid() from [#28791](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28791) fixes, since [#28791](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28791) didn't seem to include a test\r\n\r\nFor that, we'd need a chain where some blocks (at least the snapshot block, possibly also others) have additional transactions.\r\nIt seems not very clean to update the regtest chainparams everytime we want to test a snapshot with a slightly different chain.\r\nNot sure if this has been discussed before, but maybe it could make sense to add a RPC that allows us to register an entry to `m_assumeutxo_data` dynamically (just for regtest of course).\r\n\r\n",

Case where `IsValid()` is true. Then `nChainTx` must be prev `nChainTx` + `nTx`.~\r\n~2. Case where `nTx` is 0. Then `nChainTx` must be 0 because the block doesn't have transactions yet.~\r\n~3. Case where prev `nChainTx` is 0. Then `nChainTx` must be 0 because some ancestor block doesn't have transactions yet.~\r\n~4. Case where `IsAssumedValid()` is true. Probably the only meaningful thing to check in this case is that `nChainTx` is greater than prev `nChainTx`. This should always be true except if prev `IsValid()` is true and this is not the snapshot block. In that case, there will be a discontinuity and `nChainTx` will decrease because it is a bogus value following a real value.~\r\n\r\nEDIT: There are a number of mistakes in the suggestion above. It would be good to check for increasing nChainTx values, but the breakdown above is not correct. The following checks do seem to work, though:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nif (!pindex->pprev) {\r\n    // If there's no previous block, nChainTx should be set to the number\r\n    // of transactions in this block.\r\n    assert(pindex->nChainTx == pindex->nTx);\r\n} else if (pindex->IsAssumedValid()) {\r\n    // If block is assumed valid, nChainTx could be faked, but should at\r\n    // least be increasing between blocks. The only exception is\r\n    // assumed-valid blocks that are not the snapshot block and don't\r\n    // have transactions, directly following blocks that do have\r\n    // transactions. The faked nChainTx values in these will probably be\r\n    // less than the non-faked values in the previous blocks.\r\n    assert(pindex->nChainTx > pindex->pprev->nChainTx || (!pindex->IsValid() && pindex->pprev->IsValid() && pindex != GetSnapshotBaseBlock()));\r\n} else if (pindex->nTx == 0 || pindex->pprev->nChainTx == 0) {\r\n    // If block is missing transactions, or any parent block is,\r\n    // nChainTx should be unset.\r\n    assert(pindex->nChainTx == 0);\r\n} else {\r\n    // For normal blocks, nChainTx should be set to the sum of\r\n    // transactions in this and previous blocks.\r\n    assert(pindex->nChainTx == pindex->pprev->nChainTx + pindex->nTx);\r\n}\r\n```",

          "body": "The `PopulateAndValidateSnapshot` function introduced in f6e2da5fb7c6406c37612c838c998078ea8d2252 from #19806 has been setting fake `nTx` and `nChainTx` values that can show up in RPC results (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29328) and make `CBlockIndex` state hard to reason about, because it is difficult to know whether the values are real or fake.\r\n\r\nRevert to previous behavior of setting `nTx` and `nChainTx` to 0 when the values are unknown, instead of faking them. Also drop no-longer needed `BLOCK_ASSUMED_VALID` flag.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an assert failure in the `(pindex->nChainTx == pindex->nTx + prev_chain_tx)` check that would previously happen if a snapshot was loaded, and a block was submitted which forked from the chain before the snapshot block and after the last downloaded background chain block. This block would not be marked assumed-valid because it would not be an ancestor of the snapshot, and it would have `nTx` set, `nChainTx` set to a nonsense value based on a sum with the previous block's fake value, and `prev->nChainTx` set with a real value, so the assert would fail. After this commit, `nChainTx` is unset instead of being set to a fake value, so the assert succeeds. A test which submits a block like this and previously crashed the node has been added in feature_assumeutxo.py. It was written and posted by maflcko in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29261#issuecomment-1918947945 \r\n\r\nCompatibility note: This change could result in `-checkblockindex` failures if a snapshot was loaded by a previous version of Bitcoin Core and not fully validated, because fake `nTx` values will have been saved to the block index. It would be pretty easy to avoid these failures by adding some compatibility code to `LoadBlockIndex` and changing `nTx` values from 1 to 0 when they are fake (when `(pindex->nStatus & BLOCK_VALID_MASK) < BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS`), but a little simpler not to worry about being compatible in this case.",

And non-fork blocks before the snapshot block and ahead of the background chain tip will just get added to `setBlockIndexCandidates` instead of `m_blocks_unlinked`, which is fine because `FindMostWorkChain` should move them back to `m_blocks_unlinked`. As long as this happens the blocks should eventually be validated and the `nChainTx` values should get corrected.\r\n\r\nSo the \"or all parents are BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS\" comment is incorrect, but it shouldn't matter too much. #29370 should make this all more straightforward though.",
