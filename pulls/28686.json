      "body": "The idea here is to restructure `CNode` / `CConnman` / `PeerManager` a bit. Currently, net.h combines all the p2p logic in between the very low-level socket stuff (sock.h) and the high-level protocol (net_processing.h). This splits that into two parts: node/node.h that now contains `CNode`, `TransportV1`, etc that focusses on dealing with a single peer; and leaves `CConnman` in net.h, with the idea that that focusses on coordinating amongst the many peers we have (so, opening new connections, choosing what to evict, working out which node to give cpu time to next, etc).\r\n\r\nThis PR just moves code around; the idea is that future PRs would improve the separation more (see https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commits/202308-netnode and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28252#issuecomment-1680222391) and, eventually, breaking the circular dependency between `PeerManager` and `CConnman` (ie, have `PeerManager` only deal with a single node at a time, eg see the `PushMessage` changes in the repo just mentioned).",

See #27463 for project tracking and #28031 for how this code is used.\r\n\r\nSeparating this PR was suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28031#discussion_r1261414179.\r\n\r\nChanges here:\r\n- Change params to wtxid instead of txid.\r\n- Track total size (`CTransaction::GetTotalSize()` of orphans stored, as well as the size per peer.\r\n- Support having multiple announcers for the same tx. This helps us retry resolving the same orphan with multiple peers if it fails the first time.\r\n- Store the deduplicated missing parent txids in `OrphanTx` so that we don't need to calculate them again later on.\r\n- Return the erased wtxids from `EraseForBlock` which includes orphans that conflicted with the block. This helps us delete those orphan resolution attempts from our tracker.\r\n- Enable limiting the total size of orphans instead of just the total count. No new limits are introduced, the default is maximum count * maximum tx size.\r\n- Unit tests + fuzzer.",

To find an evict-able peer we go through all our peers and \"protect\" multiple categories of peers, then we evict the \"worst\" peer that is left unprotected. If there are no peers left to evict, the inbound connection is denied.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, if the inbound connection has `forceinbound` permission we start the eviction process by first protecting all `noban` and outbound connections, then selecting one of the remaining peers (if any) at random. Then we loop through all our current connections, removing protected peers from the evict-able list. If we end up protecting all our remaining connections, the randomly chosen peer is evicted.\r\n\r\n`forceinbound` implies `noban` permission.\r\n\r\nAll outbound and `noban` connections remain protected from eviction.",

          "body": "This adds five new tracepoints with documentation and tests for network connections:\r\n\r\n- established connections with `net:inbound_connection` and `net:outbound_connection`\r\n- closed connections (both closed by us or by the peer) with `net:closed_connnection`\r\n- inbound connections that we choose to evict with `net:evicted_inbound_connection`\r\n- connections that are misbehaving and punished with `net:misbehaving_connection`\r\n\r\nI've been using these tracepoints for a few months now to monitor connection lifetimes, re-connection frequency by IP and netgroup, misbehavior, peer discouragement, and eviction and more. Together with the two existing P2P message tracepoints they allow for a good overview of local P2P network activity. Also sort-of addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22006#discussion_r636775863. \r\n\r\nI've been back and forth on which arguments to include. For example, `net:evicted_connection` could also include some of the eviction metrics like e.g. `last_block_time`, `min_ping_time`, ... but I've left them out for now. If wanted, this can be added here or in a follow-up. I've tried to minimize a potential performance impact by measuring executed instructions with `gdb` where possible (method described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23724#issuecomment-996919963)). I don't think a few hundred extra instructions are too crucial, as connection opens/closes aren't too frequent (compared to e.g. P2P messages).   Note: e.g. `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()` usually executes between 80k and 90k instructions for each new inbound connection.\r\n\r\n| tracepoint                 \t| instructions                                           \t|\r\n|----------------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| net:inbound_connection     \t| 390 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:outbound_connection    \t| between 700 and 1000 ins                                     \t|\r\n| net:closed_connnection     \t| 473 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:evicted_inbound_connection     \t| not measured; likely similar to net:closed_connnection \t|\r\n| net:misbehaving_connection | not measured                                           \t|\r\n\r\nAlso added a bpftrace (tested with v0.14.1) `log_p2p_connections.bt` example script that produces output similar to:\r\n```\r\nAttaching 6 probes...\r\nLogging opened, closed, misbehaving, and evicted P2P connections\r\nOUTBOUND conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, total_out=1\r\nINBOUND conn from 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, total_in=1\r\nMISBEHAVING conn id=1, score_before=0, score_increase=20, message='getdata message size = 50001', threshold_exceeded=false\r\nCLOSED conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, established=1231006505\r\nEVICTED conn to 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, established=1612312312\r\n```",
