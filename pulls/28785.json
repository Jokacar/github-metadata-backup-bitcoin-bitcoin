    "body": "Split off from #26711 (suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26711#issuecomment-1786392253). This is part of #27463.\r\n\r\n- Add 2 new TxValidationResults\r\n  - `TX_SINGLE_FAILURE` helps us encode transactions who have failed fee checks that can be bypassed using package validation. This is distinguished from `TX_MEMPOOL_POLICY` so that we re-validate a transaction if and only if it is eligible for package CPFP.\r\n  - `TX_UNKNOWN` helps us communicate that we aborted package validation and didn't finish looking at this transaction: it's not valid but it's also not invalid (i.e. don't cache it as a rejected tx)\r\n- Return effective feerate and the wtxids of transactions used to calculate that effective feerate when the error is `TX_SINGLE_FAILURE`. Previously, we would only provide this information if the transaction passed. Now that we have package validation, it's much more helpful to the caller to know how the failing feerate was calculated. This can also be used to improve our submitpackage RPC result (which is currently a bit unhelpful when things fail).\r\n- Use the newly added `CheckPackageMempoolAcceptResult` for existing package validation tests. This increases test coverage and helps test the changes made in this PR.",

In the next commits, we will abort package\nvalidation if a tx fails for any other reason. In the future, we will\nalso decide whether to cache failures in recent_rejects based on this\nresult (we won't want to reject a package containing a transaction that\nwas rejected previously for being low feerate).\n\nPackage validation also sometimes elects to skip some transactions when\nit knows the package will not be submitted in order to quit sooner.

We don't want to accidentally reject things just because we happened to download them as a package.\r\n  - Bug prior to these changes: we required `IsChildWithParents` but if there were dependencies between the parents, we could end up (1) accepting a low-feerate child or (2) rejecting a high-feerate parent CPFPing another parent. See the \"interdependent parents\" test case for a specific example.\r\n- Be DoS-resistant.\r\n   - Avoid quadratic validation costs.\r\n   - Avoid loading a lot of stuff from disk, or loading repeatedly.\r\n\r\nA description of the package validation logic (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26711#issuecomment-1647523520):\r\n\r\n- Basic sanitization. Quit if it's too big, inconsistent, etc.\r\n- Linearize (Topological sort only)\r\n- **PreChecks loop** For each tx, grab UTXOs to calculate fees and filter out anything we should skip:\r\n    - If already in mempool (or same txid in mempool), mark as skip\r\n    - If missing inputs or conflict, record this failure and mark this and all descendants as skip.\r\n    - If no failures or TX_SINGLE_FAILURE, continue\r\n    - For some failures that we expect due to differing chainstates, skip these transactions and their descendants, but continue.\r\n    - Otherwise, record this failure and mark that we will `quit_early` (i.e. not do the Subpackage validation loop).\r\n- Refine our linearization using the fee information.\r\n- **Subpackage validation loop** For each transaction in the new linearized order:\r\n    - Get the transaction's ancestor subpackage.\r\n    - If the feerate of this transaction is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - If the feerate of this subpackage is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - Otherwise, try to submit the subpackage, using `AcceptSingleTransaction()` if it's just 1 tx\r\n    - if at any point we get a non-fee-related error, abort all.\r\n- Call `LimitMempoolSize`\r\n- Backfill results:\r\n    - If the transaction was in mempool, check to see if it's still there in case it was trimmed in `LimitMempoolSize`.\r\n    - Try to use results from the subpackage validation loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early), use results from prechecks loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early and we hadn't found a failure with it yet), fill with `TX_UNKNOWN`.\r\n\r\nThis means we will call `PreChecks` for each transaction 2 times (fewer if we quit early), and run all other validation checks at most 1 time. A transaction shouldn't be validated in the subpackage validation loop more than once.",
