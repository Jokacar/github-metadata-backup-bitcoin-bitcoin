Migration of legacy wallets uses the independent BDB parser and a minimal `LegacyDataSPKM` that allows the legacy data to be loaded so that the migration can be completed.\r\n\r\nAll tests which tested legacy wallet behavior have been removed. The `--descriptors` and `--legacy-wallet` options are removed from the functional tests.\r\n\r\nBDB has been removed as a dependency and documentation have been updated to reflect that.\r\n\r\nDepends on #26596",

          "body": "Here is a proposed timeline for the move from legacy wallets to descriptor wallets, and at the same time, bdb to sqlite, culminating with the removal of both legacy wallets and bdb. Even though the wallet type and the wallet storage format are orthogonal to each other, as noted in #19077, I would like to tie them together for the sake of simplicity when it comes to how we make new wallets and the migration of one type to another.\r\n\r\nThe 4 combinations of type and format are: legacy-bdb, legacy-sqlite, descriptor-bdb, and descriptor-sqlite. While all 4 types will be supported, we will primarily deal with legacy-bdb and descriptor-sqlite.

          "title": "Deniability - a tool to automatically improve coin ownership privacy",
          "body": "This new feature is an implementation of the ideas in Paul Sztorc's blog post \"Deniability - Unilateral Transaction Meta-Privacy\"(https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/deniability/).\r\n\r\nIn short, the idea is to periodically split coins and send them to yourself, making it look like common \"spend\" transactions, such that blockchain ownership analysis becomes more difficult, and thus improving the user's privacy.\r\n\r\nThis is the GUI portion of the PR (bitcoin-core/gui). The core functionality PR ( https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27792 ) is in the main repo (bitcoin/bitcoin).\r\n\r\nThis PR implements an additional \"Deniability\" wallet view. The majority of the GUI code is in a new deniabilitydialog.cpp/h source files containing a new DeniabilityDialog class, hooked up via the WalletView class. \r\n\r\nOn startup and on notable events (new blocks, new transactions, etc), we evaluate the privacy of all coins in the wallet, and we build a \"deniabilization\" candidate list. UTXOs that share the same destination address are grouped together into a single candidate (see DeniabilityDialog::updateCoins and DeniabilityDialog::updateCoinTable).\r\n\r\nWe inspect the blockchain data to find out if we have performed \"deniabilization\" transactions already, and we count how many \"cycles\" (self-sends) have been performed for each coin (see DeniabilityDialog::calculateDeniabilizationStats). Since we infer the state entirely from the blockchain data, even if the wallet is restored from a backup, the state would not be lost. This also means that if the user has performed manual self-sends that have improved the ownership privacy, they will be counted too.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_initial\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/6626cca3-1b96-4ccd-9463-2a91a9993faa\">\r\n\r\nThe user has a couple of controls for the \"deniabillization\" process - a Frequency selector and a Budget spinner, which respectively determine how often to perform a cycle (see below) and how much total BTC to spend on transaction fees.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_pick_budget_frequency\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/7508c23f-2ebb-4345-a440-49b9f60b8412\">\r\n\r\nThe user can initiate the \"deniabillization\" process by pressing the Start button (DeniabilityDialog::startDeniabilization). \r\nThe first time the button is pressed, we offer an information / confirmation box to explain to the user how Deniability works.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"532\" alt=\"deniability_view_start_confirmation\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/c08ee856-8736-4e4e-be71-28219735f764\">\r\n\r\nThe process periodically perform a \"deniabilization\" cycle (DeniabilityDialog::deniabilizeProc). In each such cycle we do the following: \r\nA coin is selected form the candidate list. The more a coin is \"deniabilized\", the less likely it is to be selected. Smaller coins are also less likely to be selected. If a coin is selected, we prepare and broadcast a transaction, which splits the coin into a pair of new wallet addresses (DeniabilityDialog::deniabilizeCoin). \r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_tx_awaiting_confirmation\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/df0354dc-f60f-45db-b692-db5c6ca36253\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"transaction_view_after_deniabilization\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/709084d3-227d-4c0d-ac47-cd83433b992a\">\r\n\r\nIf Bitcoin Core is left running continuously, the cycles would be performed at the selected frequency (with some randomization). If Bitcoin Core is shutdown, the \"deniabilization\" process will resume at the next restart, and if more time has elapsed than the selected frequency, it will perform a single cycle. We deliberately don't \"catch up\" all missed cycles, since that would expose the process to blockchain analysis. The state is saved and restored via QSettings (DeniabilityDialog::loadSettings and DeniabilityDialog::saveSettings).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_next_cycle_countdown\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/da5a71e1-0174-4f2a-a9b3-b8a635abe769\">\r\n\r\nWe monitor each broadcasted transaction and we automatically attempt a fee bump if the transaction is still in the memory pool since the previous cycle (DeniabilityDialog::bumpDeniabilizationTx). We don't issue any other deniabilization transactions until the previous transaction is confirmed (or abandoned/dropped).\r\n\r\nThe process ends when the budget is exhausted or if there's no candidates left. The user can also stop the process manually by pressing a Stop button (DeniabilityDialog::stopDeniabilization).\r\n\r\nExternal signers are supported in a \"best effort\" way - since the user needs to manually sign, we postpone the deniabilization processing till the external signer is connected and use some additional UI to get the user's attention to sign (see the codepath predicated on hasExternalSigner). This is not ideal, so I'm looking for ideas if we can improve this in some way.\r\n\r\nWatch-only wallets are partially supported, where we display the candidate list, but we don't allow any processing (since we don't have the private keys to issue transactions).\r\n\r\nI've tested all this functionality on regtest, testnet, signet and mainnet. I've also added some unit tests (under WalletTests) to exercise the main functions.\r\n\r\nThis is my first change and PR for Bitcoin Core, and I did my best to validate everything against the guidelines and documentation and to follow the patterns in the existing code, but I'm sure there may be things I've missed, so I'm looking forward to your feedback. \r\nIn particular one thing I'm not particularly happy with - the save/restore of state via QSettings makes me a bit nervous as we store wallet specific data keyed on wallet name, however wallets can be erased and new ones created with the same name, so this is not ideal. I made an effort to validate all data on load, but it would be great if we could improve this somehow - either by storing the settings based on some wallet identity signature, or by storing the state in the wallet database (however that doesn't seem accessible via the interfaces::Wallet API). Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

          "title": "wallet: optimize migration process, batch db transactions",
          "body": "Last step in a chain of PRs (#26836, #28894, #28987, #29403).\r\n\r\nThe initial benchmark conducted locally showed a ~65% processing time reduction, on a SSD.\r\nResults, from the very first benchmark, can be found at the end of the description.\r\n\r\n#### Detailed Description:\r\nThe current wallet migration process performs only individual db writes. Accessing disk to\r\ndelete all legacy records, clone and clean each address book entry for every created wallet,\r\ncreate each new descriptor (with their corresponding master key, caches and key pool), and\r\nalso clone and delete each transaction that requires to be transferred to a different wallet.\r\n\r\nThis work consolidates all individual disk writes into two batch operations. One for the descriptors\r\ncreation from the legacy data and a second one for the execution of the migration process itself.\r\nEfficiently dumping all the information to disk at once atomically at the end of each process.\r\n\r\nThis represent a speed up and also a consistency improvement. During migration, we either\r\nwant to succeed or fail. No other outcomes should be accepted. We should never leave a\r\npartially migrated wallet on disk and request the user to manually restore the previous wallet from\r\na backup (at least not if we can avoid it).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since db transactions relevant to the key pool generation were also batched, this work\r\nalso speeds up the regular wallet creation process.\r\n\r\n#### Note for Testers:\r\nThe first commit introduces a benchmark for the migration process. This one can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master to compare results pre and post changes.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the benchmark setup may take some time (~70 seconds here) due to the absence\r\nof a batching mechanism for the address generation process (`GetNewDestination()` calls). Which,\r\nI plan to address in a separate PR, just to not continue expanding this PR.\r\n\r\n————————————————————————\r\n\r\nBenchmark on master (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:-----------\r\n|   65,093,884,958.00 |                0.02 |    0.0% |     65.09 | `WalletMigration`\r\n\r\nBenchmark on this branch (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|   22,926,814,750.00 |                0.04 |    0.0% |     22.93 | `WalletMigration`",

At this point in time, code nits probably aren't going to be useful either.\r\n\r\nThis draft has been posted to provide a tangible example of a softfork we might pursue, and a representation of the necessary code changes.\r\n\r\n### Activation method and parameters\r\n\r\nSpecific activation parameters have not been specified here (or are marked FIXME) to avoid putting the consensus cart before the horse. The activation method here has defaulted to the one used for BIP-0341 and might change pending discussion.",

          "body": "Parsing legacy public keys can fail for three reasons (in this order):\r\n- pubkey is not in hex\r\n- pubkey has an invalid length (not 33 or 65 bytes for compressed/uncompressed, respectively)\r\n- pubkey is crytographically invalid, i.e. is not on curve (`CPubKey.IsFullyValid()` check)\r\n\r\nMany RPCs currently perform these checks manually with different error messages, even though we already have a `HexToPubKey` helper. This PR puts all three checks in this helper (the length check was done on the call-sites before), adds specific error messages for each case, and consequently uses it for all RPCs that parse legacy pubkeys. This leads to deduplicated code and also to more consistent and detailed error messages for the user.\r\n\r\nAffected RPC calls are `createmultisig`, `addmultisigaddress`, `importpubkey`, `importmulti`, `fundrawtransaction`, `walletcreatefundedpsbt`, `send` and `sendall`.\r\n\r\nNote that the error code (-5 a.k.a. `RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY`) doesn't change in any of the causes, so the changes are not breaking RPC API compatibility. Only the messages are more specific.\r\n\r\nThe last commits adds test coverage for the cryptographically invalid (not-on-curve) pubkey case which wasn't exercised before.",

          "body": "While reviewing #28307, I noticed that the test framework's `key_to_multisig_script` helper (introduced in #23305) is broken for pubkey count (n) and threshold (k) values larger than 16. This is due to the implementation currently enforcing a direct single-byte data push (using `CScriptOp.encode_op_n`), which obviously fails for values 17+. Fix that by passing the numbers directly to the CScript list, where it's automatically converted to minimally-encoded pushes (see class method `CScript.__coerce_instance`, branch `isinstance(other, int)`). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second commit adds a unit test to ensure that the encoding  is correct.",

          "body": "Fixing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28250#issuecomment-1674830104 and more.\r\n\r\nCurrently, redeem scripts longer than 520 bytes, which are technically valid under segwit rules, have flaws in the following processes:\r\n1) The multisig creation process fails to deduce the output descriptor, resulting in the generation of an incorrect descriptor. Additionally, the accompanying user warning is also inaccurate.\r\n2) The `signrawtransactionwithkey` RPC command fail to sign them.\r\n3) The legacy wallet `addmultisigaddress` wrongly discards them.\r\n\r\nThe issue arises because most of these flows are utilizing the legacy spkm keystore, which imposes\r\nthe [p2sh max redeem script size rule](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ded687334031f4790ef6a36b999fb30a79dcf7b3/src/script/signingprovider.cpp#L160) on all scripts. Which blocks segwit redeem scripts longer than\r\nthe max element size in all the previously mentioned processes (`createmultisig`, `addmultisigaddress`, and\r\n`signrawtransactionwithkey`).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem, enabling the creation of multisig output descriptors involving more than 15 keys and\r\nallowing the signing of these scripts, along with other post-segwit redeem scripts that surpass the 520-byte\r\np2sh limit.\r\n\r\nImportant note:\r\nInstead of adding support for these longer redeem scripts in the legacy wallet, an \"unsupported operation\"\r\nerror has been added. The reasons behind this decision are:\r\n\r\n1) The introduction of this feature brings about a compatibility-breaking change that requires downgrade\r\n    protection; older wallets would be unable to interact with these \"new\" legacy wallets.\r\n\r\n2) Considering the ongoing deprecation of the legacy spkm, this issue provides another compelling\r\n    reason to transition towards descriptors.\r\n\r\nTesting notes:\r\nTo easily verify each of the fixes, I decoupled the tests into standalone commits. So they can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master. Where `rpc_createmultisig.py` (with and without the `--legacy-wallet`\r\narg) will fail without the bugs fixes commits.\r\n\r\nExtra note:\r\nThe initial commits improves the `rpc_createmultisig.py` test in many ways. I found this test very\r\nantiquated, screaming for an update and cleanup.",

Because `CreateTransaction` is one of the most frequently used functions in the wallet codebase, merging this PR will significantly improve the wallet codebase's Fuzz testing!\r\n\r\nI also used the `Singleton Class` concept for creating Wallet instances because it assures that only one instance of it is created during all Fuzz runs, which significantly boosts the file's `exec/sec`.\r\n",

          "body": "A couple of users have requested that we support wallets that encrypt everything, even if the wallet is watch-only, in order to have better privacy if the wallet is stolen. This PR introduces an `EncryptedDatabase` backend for the wallet which encrypts/decrypts each key-value record individually before reading from or writing to the database.\r\n\r\n`EncryptedDatabase` is only supported for SQLite databases and descriptor wallets. This was done in order to have an easier way to get downgrade protection that also does not involve writing an existing record in plaintext (e.g. `minversion` or `flags`). SQLite has a fixed field \"application id\" that we already use for cross-network protection. This is reused to detect if a sqlite database is an encrypted wallet, and thus it prevents older software from attempting to open such wallets.\r\n\r\nIn order to read records from the database, `EncryptedDatabase` will cache the decrypted key in memory so that it can lookup the encrypted key in the database. Values will always be decrypted when read.\r\n\r\nThe encryption scheme is the same one that we use for encrypting private keys. It's not that great, but I didn't feel like re-implementing it, and it seems good enough. The encryption key itself is encrypted with the passphrase and stored in a new record.\r\n\r\nWallets with encrypted databases cannot be loaded on start. They can only be loaded by explicit user action through `loadwallet` which now has a `db_passphrase` parameter to allow the decryption of these wallets. `createwallet` also has a `db_passphrase` to create these wallets. For now, there is no way to encrypt the database after it has been created, nor is there a way to change the passphrase.",

The project is tracked in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28536\r\n\r\n## BIP352\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses strictly on the BIP logic and attempts to separate it from the wallet and transaction implementation details. This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing. Labels for the receiver are optional and thus deferred for a later PR.\r\n\r\nTest vectors from the BIP are included as unit tests.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing, it is strongly recommended you read https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458 and take a look at the reference python implementation on the BIP.\r\n",

This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

This PR makes it possible to access these parameters directly by name. This is achieved by holding the parameters in a separate `JSONRPCParameters` class which contains mappings from both name to value, and position to value. Two `operator[]` methods are implemented which can accept both strings and ints. This allows for backwards compatibility, while also allowing for future implementation to access the parameters by name.\r\n\r\nThe processing of named arguments ends up being entirely overhauled in order to be able to store the mappings to the parameters.\r\n\r\nBased on #26485 to avoid conflicting with it.",

          "title": "wallet: add `seeds` argument to `importdescriptors`",
          "body": "This PR introduces the ability to import BIP32 master seeds alongside xpubs. It currently expects seeds to be provided in [BIP 93/codex32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0093.mediawiki) either as a single seed or as a list of shares which can be assembled via Shamir Secret Sharing.\r\n\r\nIt could be generalized to other seed formats, e.g. a hex-encoding or the old `sethdseeds` WIF format, easily enough by just attempting to parse the input in those formats and retrying until we find one that works. (Though we must be extremely careful that these formats are unambiguous! If the user imports a seed they don't expect, which fails to match the one they've backed up, the result could be coin loss. For formats with no prefix or checksum, e.g. hex-encoded bytes, we may need to require the user provide a prefix or a separate flag.)\r\n\r\nThe motivation here is that users who are importing their coins from another wallet likely have them in the form of a public descriptor (probably one of the standard `pkh(BIP44/48/84/whatever)` ones) along with a master seed (probably in some seed word format, but this is easy enough to convert to a straight BIP32 seed with an external tool). The seed, presumably, they want to minimize handling of, while the descriptor they are likely to be copy/pasting from somewhere and generally being less careful with.\r\n\r\nTo import this into Core, they currently need to construct a version of their descriptor in which xpubs are replaced by xprivs, and import that. This is cumbersome and potentially dangerous. With this extra RPC flag they are able to separately tweak their descriptor however they need, and then adding their seed data, unmodified, at the last minute in one place.\r\n\r\nMy specific use case is: I have an estate planning document which contains careful instructions for reconstructing seed data from shares which are stored separately and externally to the planning document. Meanwhile, the document itself contains a public descriptor, with checksum already computed, which is stored in several locations accessible by an open-ended set of people. If I were forced to mix the secret data with the public data, it would increase the risk of leaking the secrets as well as the risk of losing the public part.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Other approaches, that I considered but chose not to take:\r\n\r\n* Extend the existing `sethdseed` RPC. This RPC is legacy-only and not supported by descriptor wallets, because it depends on the legacy \"bag of keys\" model where you could stick keys into the wallet and it'd \"just work\", often in surprising ways.\r\n* Add a new descriptor-wallet-based `importseed` RPC or something. This doesn't work for more-or-less the same reason; the descriptor wallet associates all its keys with `ScriptPubKeyManager`s, so we would need to add support for \"global keys\" somehow. This is a lot of work, lots of room for bikeshedding, and I worry that @achow101 will NACK anything that looks too much like a \"bag of keys\" model. (The situation would be much less bad than the legacy one, where 3rd parties could do stuff like mapping p2wpkh addresses to p2pkh ones and the wallet would just accept it ... but it would still potentially lead to user confusion about what exact conditions the wallet could sign for what descriptors, and it may constrain future wallet changes.)\r\n* Adding a `codex32(...)/1/2/3` xpriv format to the descriptor import format. This was suggested to me by @sipa and has the benefit that very closely matches the existing import model.\r\n\r\nPersonally I don't like the latter\r\n* for the reasons stated in the PR description -- I like my descriptors to be public, and my secret data to be limited to 16 bytes, and I think this is a common mode of operation for people coming from other wallets\r\n* ...and maybe worse, a common model for other wallet authors, who would refuse to nicely interoperate with this);\r\n* because it felt like enough of a change to deserve a change to one of the descriptor BIPs, but those are big enough already and it's hard to get tiny changes to propagate to all implementors of standards. Plus it felt wrong to couple codex32 with descriptors like this.i\r\n* because if you have multiple descirptors that use the same seed, it would force you to copy the seed multiple times, which is dangerous. (In some cases [BIP 389](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1354) will make this better, but it doesn't cover everything and anyway is not accepted or implemented yet. One thing at a time :))\r\n\r\nBut what cinched it, and made me switch to the approach in the PR, was that @roconnor-blockstream pointed out to me that the codex32 model means that you can't predict, at writing-down-the-descriptor time, exactly what shares you'll be inputting. And because descriptors have a checksum which covers their entire string encoding, this means that you can't predict ahead-of-timei what will go into the `codex32(...)` slot and therefore what the total checksum ought to be. And this means that either (a) you lose the descriptor checksum, which is a Bad Idea and also inconvenient for importers who' will have to construct a checksum with `getdescriptorinfo` to get `importdescriptors` to accept it, even though said checksum had never been used to protect data in storage; or (b) you modify the descriptor checksum algorithm to be aware of `codex(...)` and to skip checksumming the data inside of that. This means even more implementation complexity that other wallets are unlikely to bring in, plus the result generalizes less easily to other seed formats (e.g. hex) which don't have checksums of their own.\r\n\r\n",

          "title": "wallet: Keep track of the wallet's own transaction outputs in memory",
          "body": "Currently, the wallet is not actually aware about its own transaction outputs. Instead, it will iterate all of the transactions stored in `mapWallet`, and then all of the outputs of those transactions, in order to figure out what belongs to it for the purposes of coin selection and balance calculation. For balance calculation, there is caching that results in it only iterating all of the transactions, but not all of the outputs. However when the cache is dirty, everything is iterated. This is especially problematic for wallets that have a lot of transactions, or transactions that have a lot of unrelated outputs (as may occur with coinjoins or batched payments).\r\n\r\nThis PR helps to resolve this issue by making the wallet track all of the outputs that belong to it in a new member `m_txos`. Note that this includes outputs that may have already been spent. Both balance calculation (`GetBalance`) and coin selection (`AvailableCoins`) are updated to iterate `m_txos`. This is generally faster since it ignores all of the unrelated outputs, and it is not slower as in the worst case of wallets containing only single output transactions, it's exactly the same number of outputs iterated.\r\n\r\n`m_txos` is memory only, and it is populated during wallet loading. When each transaction is loaded, all of its outputs are checked to see if it is `IsMine`, and if so, an entry added to `m_txos`. When new transactions are received, the same procedure is done.\r\n\r\nSince imports can change the `IsMine` status of a transaction (although they can only be \"promoted\" from watchonly to spendable), all of the import RPCs will be a bit slower as they re-iterate all transactions and all outputs to update `m_txos`.\r\n\r\nEach output in `m_txos` is stored in a new `WalletTXO` class. This class contains references to the parent `CWalletTx` and the `CTxOut` itself. It also caches the `IsMine` value of the txout. This should be safe as `IsMine` should not change unless there are imports. This allows us to have additional performance improvements in places that use these `WalletTXO`s as they can use the cached `IsMine` rather than repeatedly calling `IsMine` which can be expensive.\r\n\r\nThe existing `WalletBalance` benchmark demonstrates the performance improvement that this PR makes. The existing `WalletAvailableCoins` benchmark doesn't as all of the outputs used in that benchmark belong to the test wallet. I've updated that benchmark to have a bunch of unrelated outputs in each transaction so that the difference is demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a larger project to have the wallet actually track and store a set of its UTXOs.\r\n\r\nBuilt on #24914 as it requires loading the txs last in order for `m_txos` to be built correctly.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks:\r\n\r\nMaster:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       92,245,141.50 |               10.84 |    0.1% |  988,823,975.00 |  66,803,340.50 |    0.0% |      2.04 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            5,709.90 |          175,134.50 |    0.5% |       80,968.24 |      25,539.15 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|          139,396.17 |            7,173.80 |    0.6% |    1,383,390.50 |     430,276.86 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            5,055.80 |          197,792.47 |    0.3% |       80,968.10 |      25,539.02 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|                9.79 |      102,152,396.19 |    0.1% |          161.00 |          37.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,552,736.00 |              644.02 |    1.5% |   20,316,315.80 |     618,545.80 |    0.6% |      0.08 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|      114,114,732.00 |                8.76 |    0.5% |1,291,047,717.60 | 320,244,602.00 |    0.0% |      6.30 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      359,315,754.00 |                2.78 |    0.1% |4,339,447,818.00 | 136,619,757.00 |    0.7% |      1.80 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|       98,230,601.00 |               10.18 |    0.1% |  537,688,964.00 |  97,332,266.00 |    0.3% |      0.49 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n\r\nPR:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       75,319,868.50 |               13.28 |    0.2% |  863,758,229.00 |  30,892,593.00 |    0.2% |      1.66 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            2,367.62 |          422,364.95 |    1.0% |       35,785.05 |       9,893.01 |    0.2% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|            2,685.58 |          372,359.55 |    0.2% |       36,501.05 |      10,027.01 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            3,462.24 |          288,830.68 |    2.7% |       35,785.06 |       9,893.01 |    0.3% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|               11.65 |       85,838,176.97 |    0.1% |          180.00 |          42.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,563,092.60 |              639.76 |    1.5% |   20,426,154.40 |     649,953.80 |    0.6% |      0.09 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|       58,367,804.40 |               17.13 |    0.9% |  587,164,005.00 | 107,905,843.80 |    0.1% |      3.21 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      365,302,636.00 |                2.74 |    0.2% |4,349,345,147.00 | 138,730,668.00 |    0.8% |      1.83 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|      124,995,585.00 |                8.00 |    1.2% |  801,998,316.00 | 103,210,721.00 |    0.3% |      0.63 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n",

          "body": "This PR adds `last_block_announcement` to the per-peer `getpeerinfo` RPC result. This is the most recent time that this peer was the first to notify our node of a new block (one that we didn't already know about), or zero if this peer has never been the first to notify us of a new block. This timestamp already exists internally and is used for stale-tip eviction logic; this PR exposes it at the RPC layer.\r\n\r\nThis PR started out as a suggestion for additional test coverage, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26172#issuecomment-1259678260. It turned out that the easiest way to test (already-merged) #26172 is to add this field to `getpeerinfo` and have a functional test verify its value. But it may also be useful to have this result in its own right, similar to that RPC's existing `last_block` field -- it indicates something about the quality of our peers. It allows one to predict which peer will be evicted when the stale tip logic activates. (I'm not sure if that would be useful, but it may be.)\r\n\r\nThe functional test added here fails without #26172, which is the main goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not test the actual stale-tip eviction logic; that's difficult to do with a functional test. But it does test the correctness of the timestamp that the eviction logic depends on. #23352 is an attempt to test the eviction logic using a unit test, it's not ready to be merged yet. I think having both kinds of tests would be beneficial.",

This makes it difficult to add new automatically generated descriptors when new ones are introduced. So instead of losing this information after the descriptors are created, have `CWallet` store it. The xpub will be stored in a new `activehdkey` field. The private key must be one of the keys that is used by the descriptors, and will be extracted upon loading.\r\n\r\nAs this is a new field, wallets will be automatically upgraded upon loading. This loading is backwards compatible and uses a new non-required flag `WALLET_FLAG_GLOBAL_HD_KEY` to signal that the upgrade completed. The upgrade will search for an xpub that is shared by `pkh()`, `wpkh()`, and `sh(wpkh()` descriptors with the derivation pattern that we use. For new wallets, the xpub will be set during descriptor creation rather than trying to reverse engineer it. The flag will be set for all wallets, regardless of whether such an xpub was found or can even exist, in order to indicate that the upgrade will not need to be run in the future.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to have a `gethdkey` command which is useful for those who need a simple way to get an xpub from a wallet. `gethdkey` can also take a boolean parameter to indicate whether it should also output the corresponding xprv.\r\n\r\nSupercedes #23417",

It provides read only access to a BDB file, and can therefore be used as a read only database backend for wallets. This will be used for dumping legacy wallet records and migrating legacy wallets without the need for BDB itself.\r\n\r\nWallettool's `dump` command is changed to use `BerkeleyRODatabase` instead of `BerkeleyDatabase` (and `CWallet` itself) to demonstrate that this parser works and to test it against the existing wallettool functional tests.",

This is done in various places, such as `IsMine`, and helper functions for fetching a `ScriptPubKeyMan` and a `SolvingProvider`. This also has a bit of a performance impact on standard descriptor wallets, although less noticeable due to the small number of SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAs these functions are based on doing `IsMine` for each `ScriptPubKeyMan`, we can improve this performance by caching `IsMine` scriptPubKeys for all descriptors and use that to determine which `ScriptPubKeyMan` to actually use for those things. This cache is used exclusively and we no longer iterate the SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAlso added a benchmark for `IsMine`.",

This is especially useful when a new default descriptor has been implemented as it allows wallets created before that time to quickly and easily add that type of descriptor.\r\n\r\nIn particular, descriptor wallets created before Taproot was implemented can use the new `createwalletdescriptor` RPC in order to get a Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to keep the newly generated descriptor in line with the existing descriptors, this PR uses #26728 as it exposes a \"wallet extended key\" for us (in addition to upgrading wallets implemented prior to have a wallet xpub). The newly generated descriptors will use the \"wallet extended key\" stored in `CWallet` that PR adds.\r\n\r\n`createwalletdescriptor` is generic and so it can also be used with the other address types. Of course, it given the same wallet extended key, address type, and internal-ness, it will create the same descriptor. So some refactoring has been done in order to detect that the same descriptor is about to be created, and to avoid overwriting any existing descriptors.",

          "title": "descriptors: Be able to specify change and receiving in a single descriptor string",
          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",

It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",

          "body": "Erlay Project Tracking: #28646\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation of  [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518) , using primitives in the BIP-330 (see the updated spec  [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki) ). Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670).\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I’ll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n* save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n* increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n* improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\n### How to review\r\n\r\nI suggest doing `make clean && autogen.sh && configure` before you try building it locally.",

See [doc/design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/design/multiprocess.md) for usage details and future plans.\r\n\r\nThe change is implemented by adding a new [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that spawns new wallet and node subprocesses that can be controlled over a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) by calling [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/node.h), [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/wallet.h), and [`ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/chain.h) methods. When running with split processes, you can see the IPC messages going back and forth in `-debug=1` output. Followup PR's #19460 and #19461 add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\r\n\r\nThe IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/ipc/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\nSlides from a presentation describing this change are available on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722).\r\n",

          "title": "test: refactor: support sending funds with outpoint result",
          "body": "In wallet-related functional tests we often want to send funds to an address and  use the resulting (non-change) UTXO directly after as input for another transaction. Doing that is currently tedious, as it involves finding the index part of the outpoint manually by calling helpers like `find_vout_for_address` or `find_output` first.  This results in two different txid/vout variables which then again have to be combined to a single dictionary `{\"txid\": ..., \"vout\": ...}` in order to be specified as input for RPCs like `createrawtransaction` or `createpsbt`. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntxid1 = node1.sendtoaddress(addr1, value1)\r\nvout1 = find_vout_for_address(node1, txid1, addr1)\r\ntxid2 = node2.sendtoaddress(addr2, value2)\r\nvout2 = find_vout_for_address(node2, txid2, addr2)\r\nnode.createrawtransaction([{'txid': txid1, 'vout': vout1}, {'txid': txid2, 'vout': vout2}], .....)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a helper `create_outpoints` to immediately return the outpoint as\r\nUTXO dictionary in the common format, making the tests more readable and avoiding unnecessary duplication:\r\n\r\n```\r\nutxo1 = self.create_outpoints(node1, outputs=[{addr1: value1}])[0]\r\nutxo2 = self.create_outpoints(node2, outputs=[{addr2: value2}])[0]\r\nnode.createrawtransaction([utxo1, utxo2], .....)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTests are switched to work with UTXO-objects rather than two individual txid/vout variables accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe `find_output` helper is removed, as it seems generally a bad idea to search for an outpoint only based on the output value. If that's really ever needed in the future, it makes probably more sense to add it as an additional parameter to `find_vout_of_address`. Note that `find_output` supported specifying a block-hash for where to look for the transaction (being passed on to the `getrawtransaction` RPC). This seems to be unneeded, as txids are always unique and for the only test that used that parameter (rpc_psbt.py) there was no observed difference in run-time, so it was not reintroduced in the new helper.\r\n\r\nThere are still some `find_vout_of_address` calls remaining, used for detecting change outputs or for whenever the sending happens via `sendrawtransaction` instead, so this PR tackles not all, but the most common case.",

If any issues are detected before or after merge, this should be easy to revert. If no issues arise, it should be fine to make use of more involved C++20 features later on.",

          "body": "`CWallet::GetEncryptionKey()` would return a reference to the internal\r\n`CWallet::vMasterKey`, guarded by `CWallet::cs_wallet`, which is unsafe.\r\n\r\nReturning a copy would be a shorter solution, but could have security\r\nimplications of the master key remaining somewhere in the memory even\r\nafter `CWallet::Lock()` (the current calls to\r\n`CWallet::GetEncryptionKey()` are safe, but that is not future proof).\r\n\r\nSo, instead of `EncryptSecret(m_storage.GetEncryptionKey(), ...)`\r\nchange the `GetEncryptionKey()` method to provide the encryption\r\nkey to a given callback:\r\n`m_storage.WithEncryptionKey([](const CKeyingMaterial& k) { EncryptSecret(k, ...); })`\r\n\r\nThis silences the following (clang 18):\r\n\r\n```\r\nwallet/wallet.cpp:3520:12: error: returning variable 'vMasterKey' by reference requires holding mutex 'cs_wallet' [-Werror,-Wthread-safety-reference-return]\r\n 3520 |     return vMasterKey;\r\n      |            ^\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n_Previously this PR modified both ArgsManager and wallet code. But the ArgsManager commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/856c88776f8486446602476a1c9e133ac0cff510 was merged in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29040 so now this only affects wallet code. The previous PR description was:_\r\n\r\nAvoid this unsafe pattern from `ArgsManager` and `CWallet`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nclass A\r\n{\r\n    Mutex mutex;\r\n    Foo member GUARDED_BY(mutex);\r\n    const Foo& Get()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(mutex);\r\n        return member;\r\n    } // callers of `Get()` will have access to `member` without owning the mutex.\r\n```",

          "body": "Right now a wallet descriptor is converted to its string representation (via `Descriptor::ToString`) repeatedly at different instances:\r\n- on finding a `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan` for a given descriptor (`CWallet::GetDescriptorScriptPubKeyMan`, e.g. used by the `importdescriptors` RPC); the string representation is created once for each spkm in the wallet and at each iteration again for the searched descriptor (`DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan::HasWalletDescriptor`)\r\n- whenever `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan::GetID()` is called, e.g. in `TopUp` or any instances where a descriptor is written to the DB to determine the database key, also at less obvious places like `FastWalletRescanFilter` etc.\r\n\r\nAs there is no good reason to calculate a fixed descriptor's string/ID more than once, add the ID as a field to `WalletDescriptor` and calculate it immediately at initialization (or deserialization). `HasWalletDescriptor` is changed to compare the spkm's and searched descriptor's ID instead of the string to take use of that.\r\n\r\nThis speeds up the functional test `wallet_miniscript.py` by a factor of 5-6x on my machine (3m30.95s on master vs. 0m38.02s on PR). The recently introduced \"max-size TapMiniscript\" test-case introduced a descriptor that takes 2-3 seconds to create a string representation, so the repeated calls to that were significantly hurting the performance.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28800.",

          "body": "A transaction does not necessarily have to belong to either the migrated wallet (with the private keys) and the watchonly wallet (with watchonly things), it could have multiple outputs with each isminetype. So we should be putting such transactions in one or the other wallet, but rather putting it in both.\r\n\r\nI've added a test for this behavior, however the test also revealed a few other issues. Notably, it revealed that `migratewallet` would have the watchonly wallet rescan from genesis when it is reloaded at the end of migration. This could be a cause for migration appearing to be very slow. This is resolved by first writing best block records to the watchonly and solvable wallets, as well as updating the test to make sure that rescans don't happen.\r\n\r\nThe change to avoid rescans also found an issue where some of our early exits would result in unloading the wallet even though nothing happened. So there is also a commit to reload the wallet for such early exits.",

          "body": "**Note: this PR has been superseded by #28948 (v3) and #28984 (package RBF)**\r\n\r\nSee #27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 2 projects: v3 policy and package RBF. Mailing list posts: [package RBF 1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019464.html) and [V3 + package RBF 2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html). It stems from a long discussion about RBF pinning, across a [mailing list thread](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html) and [gist](https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff).\r\n\r\nV3 Policy: A set of policy rules applied to transactions with their `nVersion` field set to 3. Namely, it allows users to opt in to more restrictive descendant limits for shared transactions. If adopted by many nodes in the network, V3 mitigates various RBF pinning attacks. See doc/policy/version3_transactions.md for the exact rules and rationale, and [these review club notes](bitcoincore.reviews/25038) for more background and discussion.\r\n\r\nPackage RBF: In addition to allowing a child to pay for its parents within the package, also allow the child to pay for replacing the parent's conflicts. For example, this allows LN users to replace commitment transactions existing in the mempool, simply by broadcasting their respective commitment transactions with a high-fee child. The commitment transactions can be signed with 0 fees, which means no overpaying.\r\n\r\nFAQ: is v3 still helpful even with cluster mempool (#27677) ?\r\n\r\n- Rule 3 pinning: This is addressed with v3 but not really with cluster mempool (descendant allowance is still too permissive).\r\n- Package RBF and ACP pinning: This PR allows for package RBF with v3 packages. V3 has an effective \"cluster limit\" of 2 which makes it very cheap to calculate the mining score of a v3 transaction. With cluster mempool, which also makes it easier to calculate mining score, we could have package RBF for non-v3 transactions.\r\n- Allowing 0fee transactions: This PR allows v3 transactions to be below minimum relay feerate, provided they are CPFP'd. This is because the simplified topology allows us to avoid situations like the ones described in #26933. With cluster mempool, we can allow this for non-v3 transactions.",

          "body": "See #27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nDelving Bitcoin discussion thread: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/v3-transaction-policy-for-anti-pinning/340\r\nDelving Bitcoin discussion for LN usage: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/lightning-transactions-with-v3-and-ephemeral-anchors/418\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n- There are various pinning problems with RBF and our general ancestor/descendant limits. These policies help mitigate many pinning attacks and make package RBF feasible (see #28984 which implements package RBF on top of this). I would focus the most here on Rule 3 pinning. [1][2]\r\n- Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see #27677 and #28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n\r\nV3 policy is for \"Priority Transactions.\" [3][4] It allows users to opt in to more restrictive topological limits for shared transactions, in exchange for the more robust fee-bumping abilities that offers. Even though we don't have cluster limits, we are able to treat these transactions as having as having a maximum cluster size of 2.\r\n\r\nImmediate benefits:\r\n\r\n- You can presign a transaction with 0 fees (not just 1sat/vB!) and add a fee-bump later.\r\n- Rule 3 pinning is reduced by a significant amount, since the attacker can only attach a maximum of 1000vB to your shared transaction.\r\n \r\nThis also enables some other cool things (again see #27463 for overall roadmap):\r\n- Ephemeral Anchors\r\n- Package RBF for these 1-parent-1-child packages. That means e.g. a commitment tx + child can replace another commitment tx using the child's fees.\r\n- We can transition to a \"single anchor\" universe without worrying about package limit pinning. So current users of CPFP carve out would have something else to use.\r\n- We can switch to a cluster-based mempool [5] (#27677 #28676), which removes CPFP carve out [6].\r\n\r\n[1]: Original mailing list post and discussion about RBF pinning problems https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff, https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html\r\n[2]: A FAQ is \"we need this for cluster mempool, but is this still necessary afterwards?\" There are some pinning issues that are fixed here and not fully fixed in cluster mempool, so we will still want this or something similar afterward.\r\n[3]: Mailing list post for v3 https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html\r\n[4]: Original PR #25038 also contains a lot of the discussion\r\n[5]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393/7\r\n[6]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393#the-cpfp-carveout-rule-can-no-longer-be-supported-12",

To be able to use `createwalletdescriptor` with the other address types, we need a way to change the wallet extended key, and so `sethdseed` has been updated and enabled for descriptor wallets. As with legacy wallets, when called without parameters, it will generate a new random master key for the wallet. It can also take a xprv and set that as the master key. It still takes a BIP 32 seed as WIF or as hex as we do for legacy wallets. The seed will be transformed into and stored as a BIP 32 extended key. The latter is to give us greater compatibility with other wallets which often produce non-WIF HD seeds.\r\n\r\nSplit from #25907",

          "body": "There are at least three ways to detect the operating system in Python3:\r\n- `os.name` (https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/os.html#os.name)\r\n- `sys.platform` (https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/sys.html#sys.platform)\r\n- `platform.system()` (https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/platform.html#platform.system)\r\n\r\nWe are currently using all of them in functional tests (both in individual tests and shared test framework code), which seems a bit messy. This PR consolidates into using `platform.system()`, as it appears to be one most consistent and easy to read (see also [IRC discussion](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2023-12-08#989301;) and table below). `sys.platform` is inconsistent as it has the major version number encoded for BSD systems, which doesn't make much sense for e.g. OpenBSD, where there is no concept of major versions, but instead the version is simply increased by 0.1 on each release.\r\n\r\nNote that `os.name` is still useful to detect whether we are running a POSIX system (see `BitcoinTestFramework.skip_if_platform_not_posix`), so for this use-case it is kept as only exception. The following table shows values for common operating systems, found via\r\n```\r\n$ python3 -c \"import os; import sys; import platform; print(os.name, sys.platform, platform.system())\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n|     OS       | os.name | sys.platform | platform.system()  |\r\n|--------------|---------|--------------|--------------------|\r\n| Linux 6.2.0  |  posix  |   linux      |      Linux         |\r\n| MacOS*       |  posix  |   darwin     |      Darwin        |\r\n| OpenBSD 7.4  |  posix  |   openbsd7   |      OpenBSD       |\r\n| Windows*     |  nt     |   win32      |      Windows       |\r\n\r\n\\* = I neither have a MacOS nor a Windows machine available, so I extracted the values from documentation and our current code. Also I'm relying on CI for testing the relevant code-paths. Having reviewers to this this locally would be very appreciated, if this gets Concept ACKed.",

This is because the check for whether a wallet is already a descriptor wallet uses the presence of a `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` which is only setup when keys or scripts are found. This PR resolves this issue by checking for the descriptor wallet flag instead and subsequently skipping the keys and scripts part of migration for blank wallets.\r\n\r\nFixes the issue mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28868#issuecomment-1809641110",

          "body": "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29109#issuecomment-1863449058 reports that a wallet with noncritical errors cannot be dumped with `bitcoin-wallet dump`. This was caused by an erroneous reset of the wallet pointer when the loading the wallet returns something other than `LOAD_OK`. Not all errors are errors that require aborting, so unilaterally resetting the pointer at that time is incorrect. The first commit resolves this issue.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if a wallet has loading errors, that should not prevent the wallet tool from dumping the wallet. The wallet application logic should not get in the way of performing such a low level database operation, especially when it's primary usage is for debugging potentially corrupted wallets. The 2nd commit is taken from #28710 and changes the `dump` to stop at making a `WalletDatabase` rather than making a `CWallet` only to retrieve the underlying `WalletDatabase`.",

Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Move `Split` functions from `util/spanparsing.h` to `util/string.h`, using `util` namespace for clarity.\r\n- Move remaining spanparsing functions to `script/parsing.h` since they are used for descriptor and miniscript parsing.\r\n- Combine `util/fees.h` and `util/errors.h` into `common/messages.h` so there is a place for simple functions that generate user messages to live, and these functions are not part of the util library.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this change is that the util library is a dependency of the kernel, and we should remove functionality from util that shouldn't be called by kernel code or kernel applications. These changes should also improve code organization and make functions easier to discover. Some of these same moves are (or were) part of #28690, but did not help with code organization, or made it worse, so it is better to move them and clean them up in the same PR so code only has to change one time.\r\n",

          "title": "sqlite: Disallow writing from multiple `SQLiteBatch`s",
          "body": "The way that we have configured SQLite to run means that only one database transaction can be open at a time. Typically, each individual read and write operation will be its own transaction that is opened and committed automatically by SQLite. However, sometimes we want these operations to be batched into a multi-statement transaction, so `SQLiteBatch::TxnBegin`, `SQLiteBatch::TxnCommit`, and `SQLiteBatch::TxnAbort` are used to manage the transaction of the database.\r\n\r\nHowever, once a db transaction is begun with one `SQLiteBatch`, any operations performed by another `SQLiteBatch` will also occur within the same transaction. Furthermore, those other `SQLiteBatch`s will not be expecting a transaction to be active, and will abort it once the `SQLiteBatch` is destructed. This is problematic as it will prevent some data from being written, and also cause the `SQLiteBatch` that opened the transaction in the first place to be in an unexpected state and throw an error.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this situation, we need to prevent the multiple batches from writing at the same time. To do so, I've implemented added a `CSemaphore` within `SQLiteDatabase` which will be used by any `SQLiteBatch` trying to do a write operation. `wait()` is called by `TxnBegin`, and at the beginning of `WriteKey`, `EraseKey`, and `ErasePrefix`. `post()` is called in `TxnCommit`, `TxnAbort` and at the end of `WriteKey`, `EraseKey`, and `ErasePrefix`. To avoid deadlocking on ` TxnBegin()` followed by a `WriteKey()`, `SQLiteBatch will now also track whether a transaction is in progress so that it knows whether to use the semaphore.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not a problem for BDB wallets since BDB uses WAL and provides transaction objects that must be used if an operation is to occur within a transaction. Specifically, we either pass a transaction pointer, or a nullptr, to all BDB operations, and this allows for concurrent transactions so it doesn't have this problem.\r\n\r\nFixes #29110",

          "body": "This PR adds a `createwalletdescriptor` RPC which allows users to add new automatically generated descriptors to their wallet, e.g. to upgrade a 0.21.x wallet to contain a taproot descriptor. This RPC takes 3 arguments: the output type to create a descriptor for, whether the descriptor will be internal or external, and the HD key to use if the user wishes to use a specific key. The HD key is an optional parameter. If it is not specified, the wallet will use the key shared by the active descriptors, if they are all single key. For most users in the expected upgrade scenario, this should be sufficient. In more advanced cases, the user must specify the HD key to use.\r\n\r\nCurrently, specified HD keys must already exist in the wallet. To make it easier for the user to know, `gethdkeys` is also added to list out the HD keys in use by all of the descriptors in the wallet. This will include all HD keys, whether we have the private key, for it, which descriptors use it and their activeness, and optionally the extended private key. In this way, users with more complex wallets will be still be able to get HD keys from their wallet for use in other scenarios, and if they want to use `createwalletdescriptor`, they can easily get the keys that they can specify to it.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1866961865",

To do that, SFFO logic needs to be moved out of `FundTransaction` so the `CRecipient` objects with the correct SFFO information can be created and then passed to `FundTransaction`.\r\n\r\nAs a secondary motivation, this PR moves the SFFO stuff closer to the caller, making the code cleaner and easier to understand. This is done by having a single function which parses RPC inputs for SFFO and consistently using the `set<int>` method for communicating SFFO.\r\n\r\nI'm also not convinced we need to pass a full `CMutableTx` object to `FundTransaction`, but I'm leaving that for a follow-up PR/discussion, as its not a blocker for silent payments.",

          "body": "It is sometimes useful for the wallet to have keys that it can sign with but are not (initially) involved in any scripts, e.g. for setting up a multisig. Ryanofsky [suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1867721948) A `void(KEY)` descriptor which allows for a key to be specified, but produces no scripts. These can be imported into the wallet, and subsequently retrieved with `gethdkeys`. Additionally, `listdescriptors` will output these descriptors so that they can be easily backed up.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it easier for people to add HD keys to their wallet, and to generate a new one if they want to rotate their descriptors, an `addhdkey` RPC is also added. Without arguments, it will generate a new HD key and add it to the wallet via a `void(KEY)` descriptor. If provided a private key, it will construct the descriptor and add it to the wallet.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1866961865\r\n\r\nBased on #29130 as `gethdkeys` is useful for testing this.",

For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs.

          "body": "C++20 introduced the `contains` method on containers to check if an element is in the container. It can be used instead of the `count` method now.\r\nI believe it is easier to understand, as `contains` directly returns a `bool` indicating whether the element exists, while `count` returns the number of occurrences of the element, which then often needs to be compared against 0.\r\nAlso, it is slightly more efficient than count for this use-case.\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces the clang-tidy check `readability-container-contains` and fixes the instances where `count` is being used where `contains` could be used instead. I used the clang-tidy -fix option to do it automatically.",

          "body": "Originally motivated by #29019, which reverts back to having `requestMempoolTransactions` emit `transactionAddedToMempool` in `mapTx` default order instead of `GetSortedDepthAndScore` order.\r\n\r\nIt's important that these notifications happen in topological order, otherwise the wallet rescan may miss transactions that belong to it. Notably, checking whether a transaction `IsFromMe` requires knowing its inputs, which may be from a mempool parent.\r\n\r\nWhen using `mapTx` order, a parent may come later than its child if it was added from a block disconnected in a reorg.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a test for this case.",

          "body": "Discovered while was reviewing #29112, specifically https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29112#pullrequestreview-1821862931.\r\n\r\nIf the db handler that initiated the database transaction is destroyed,\r\nthe ongoing transaction cannot be left dangling when the db txn fails\r\nto abort. It must be forcefully reverted; otherwise, any subsequent\r\ndb handler executing a write operation will dump the dangling,\r\nto-be-reverted transaction data to disk.\r\n\r\nThis not only breaks the isolation property but also results in the\r\nimproper storage of incomplete information on disk, impacting\r\nthe wallet consistency.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by resetting the db connection, automatically\r\nrolling back the transaction (per https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/close.html)\r\nwhen the handler object is being destroyed and the txn abortion failed.\r\n\r\nTesting Notes\r\nCan verify the failure by reverting the fix e5217fea and running the test.\r\nIt will fail without e5217fea and pass with it.",

          "body": "Given that the use of a transaction's nVersion is always as an unsigned int, it doesn't make sense to store it as signed and then cast it to unsigned everywhere it is used and displayed.\r\n\r\nSince a few alternative implementations have recently been revealed to have made an error with this signedness that would have resulted in consensus failure, I think it makes sense for us to just make this always unsigned to make it clear that the version is treated as unsigned. This would also help us avoid future potential issues with signedness of this value.\r\n\r\nI believe that this is safe and does not actually change what transactions would or would not be considered both standard and consensus valid. Within consensus, the only use of the version in consensus is in BIP68 validation which was already casting it to uint32_t. Within policy, although it is used as a signed int for the transaction version number check, I do not think that this change would change standardness. Standard transactions are limited to the range [1, 2]. Negative numbers would have fallen under the < 1 condition, but by making it unsigned, they are still non-standard under the > 2 condition.\r\n\r\nUnsigned and signed ints are serialized and unserialized the same way so there is no change in serialization.",

          "body": "Improve new LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(),  LogWarning(), LogError() macros introduced in #28318:\r\n\r\n- Make them consistent, now all accepting the same parameters.\r\n- Make them all accept log categories, to make it possible to filter or highlight log messages from a particular component.\r\n- Make them compatible with wallet logging, which includes the wallet name in log messages.\r\n- Make them not rely on a global LogInstance, to provide better control of logging in controlled environments, such as unit tests that want to selectively capture log output, or libbitcoinkernel applications that want to have multiple instances of validation objects without mixing their log output.\r\n- Make them less verbose by not requiring category constants to be specified in individual log prints.\r\n\r\nAn [overview](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0cd1616d47e61e125eb3e573573c0c56fba6b775/src/logging.h#L293-L332) of the macros can be found in the logging header.\r\n\r\n### Problems this PR attempts to solve\r\n\r\nThe new log macros in introduced #28318 are generally great. They allow writing code that is succinct and clear, and make it a lot easier to figure out what log levels are being used. Unfortunately, the new macros are slightly less general than than needed to be used throughout the codebase. Particularly:\r\n\r\n1. The new macros cannot be used conveniently in wallet code because wallet log prints are supposed to automatically attach wallet names to log messages.\r\n2. The new macros cannot be used in libbitcoinkernel code because they do not allow specifying a logger instance.\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, the only alternative approach to solving these problems would be to reimplement these macros outside the logging framework so they could be used by wallet and validation code. This PR just takes the approach of slightly generalizing these macros so they work everywhere.\r\n\r\n### Note to reviewers\r\n\r\nI'd encourage looking at the description and code changes in this PR to evaluate it and try to come an independent judgement before looking at the discussion history. Unfortunately and regrettably, I made some dismissive comments on the previous PR, so the discussion here starts out immediately heated. I think the criticisms in the discussion are well intended and made in good faith, but they go down a lot of tangents, and as far as I can tell are only making the argument that this PR is unnecessary, not that it is harmful, so I don't think they are essential to read or understand.",

          "body": "Depends on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27601, please go there first.\r\n\r\nThis work aims to define, and implement a base standard mechanism to\r\ndetect individual change outputs.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nCurrently, the wallet detects whether an output is change or not based\r\non data stored in the address book.\r\n\r\nThere is no notion of “change outputs”, the wallet detects change scripts.\r\n\r\nConnoting that any address book record modification has implications\r\non all the historical outputs related to that particular destination. Meaning\r\nthat all those outputs can either be change or not. There is no middle-ground\r\ngranular distinction.\r\n\r\n#### How Change Detection Currently Works?\r\n\r\nThe wallet walks-through the transaction outputs, extracts the script\r\ndestination and verify the following two points:\r\n\r\n1) If the destination doesn't exist in the address book, then the script\r\n    is a \"change address\".\r\n   \r\n2) If the destination exists in the address book, but it doesn't have a\r\n     label, then the script is a \"change address\".\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are a good number of problems in the current approach:\r\n\r\n- We make the wallet dependent on an external structure, with separate storage.\r\n   Which has to be updated and maintained along with the wallet state.\r\n\r\n- It cannot be maintained nor recovered across different wallet instances.\r\n   Cannot re-create the, possibly custom, address book data only by importing\r\n   the wallet descriptor string.\r\n\r\n- As the address book is an structure that the user can freely modify, the change\r\n   detection process might differ through different wallets.\r\n \r\n- The current rudimentary assumptions of \"no address book entry\" or \"no label set for the address book entry\"\r\n  to denote that certain script destination is change or not can easily be broken:\r\n  E.g. derive an address from one of the wallet’s external paths manually. Then send coins to it.\r\n  As the receive destination wasn't created inside the wallet, the wallet has no associated address book entry.\r\n  So, the reception is invalidly detected as change (added a test case for it).\r\n\r\n- The wallet can't detect change outputs on more complex scripts such as multi-sig change outputs.\r\n\r\n- The wallet is not able to detect change outputs going to an internal address if the internal address has a label.\r\n  (E.g. the user can manually set a label for the internal address and, doing that, make that all the change\r\n  outputs, in the wallet history, that were sent to the destination are no longer detected as change).\r\n\r\n- There isn’t a way to distinguish the external reception of coins into an internal address. Coins reception on any\r\n   internal address are always detected as change.\r\n\r\n### New Change Detection Mechanism Goals\r\n\r\nAiming to:\r\n\r\n* Define a base mechanism to align different wallet implementations. Preventing each piece of software\r\n  from diverging on the basic change outputs distinction.\r\n\r\n* Detect change outputs on-demand without requiring to maintain an external data structure synced with the\r\n   latest wallet state.\r\n\r\n* Independently, and accurately, detect change outputs regardless data stored in structures that the user\r\n   can freely modify.\r\n\r\n* Granular distinction between change vs non-change outputs that were sent to the same internal address.\r\n  E.g. the reception of coins, from an external source, on internal addresses will not longer be detected\r\n  as change anymore.\r\n\r\n* Expand the change detection to more complex scripts such as a multi-sig protected addresses. (While they\r\n  are added into the wallet on an internal spkm)\r\n\r\n#### Change Output Detection Rules\r\n\r\nA transaction output is change if it fulfills the following points:\r\n\r\n1) At least one of the parent transaction inputs is from the wallet. (If none of them are, then the wallet is receiving coins\r\n    on an internal address).\r\n\r\n2) The script extracted destination is from the wallet and is located in one of the internal script pub key manager.\r\n    (e.g. derived from an internal derivation path)\r\n\r\n#### What about legacy wallets?\r\n\r\nIf the legacy wallet is HD post-split, we have an internal derivation path, so we can follow the same process as\r\ndescriptors wallet. Unless the destination is on the pre-split key pool, in which case, we fallback to the follow-up\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nIf the legacy wallet is pre-split, we continue using the address book as we either have an HD wallet with keys\r\nderived only on the external path, or we are using raw keypool.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————\r\n\r\n#### Extra Note\r\nThis PR, in about 85% at least, is about expanding the current test coverage for the change output detection area.\r\n\r\n#### TO DO (still WIP):\r\n\r\n* [x] Save “internal” flag on non-active descriptors so the wallet can use them on the change detection process.\r\n   (which will fix the currently failing test cases).\r\n* [ ] Re-organize commits so tests always pass.\r\n* [ ] Verify backwards compatibility.",

The result is 06216b344dea6ad6c385fda0b37808ff9ae5273b.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it expands the test coverage for the `ErasePrefix` functionality and documents the db txn requirement for `BerkeleyBatch::ErasePrefix` .",

          "title": "Broadcast own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections",
          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* Independent improvement (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29419):\r\n  * `log: deduplicate category names and improve logging.cpp`\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

Brother of #28894.\r\n\r\nIncludes two different, yet interconnected, performance and code improvements to the zap wallet transactions process.\r\n\r\n1) As the goal of the `ZapSelectTx` function is to erase tx records that match any of the inputted hashes. There is no need to traverse the whole database record by record. We could just check if the tx exist, and remove it directly by calling `EraseTx()`.\r\n\r\n2) Instead of performing single write operations per removed tx record, this PR batches them all within a single atomic db txn.\r\n\r\nMoreover, these changes will enable us to consolidate all individual write operations that take place during the wallet migration process into a single db txn in the future.",

          "body": "Compiling C++ code with `-D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600` causes problems on OpenBSD. If that define is set, the C++ standard header detection routine in BDB's configure script fails due to a missing type name for `locale_t` (see https://gist.github.com/theStack/b41884e31ebc5cdca3220bcaa674cb70 for the relevant config.log part).\r\n\r\nThis results in `HAVE_CXX_STDHEADERS` not being defined, which then it turn leads to the inclusion of `<iostream.h>` (rather than `<iostream>`), which doesn't exist, as described in #28963.\r\n\r\nAccording to a mailing list post discussing a similar problem [1], \"OpenBSD provides the POSIX APIs by default\", so we don't need this define anyway and can remove it. This fixes the BDB build problem as described in issue #28963. See also https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/pull/6205/commits/f87e75ae71a2301daf2ad59b180977fc30c6abe4 for a similar fix for google's flatbuffer project.\r\n\r\nTested on OpenBSD 7.4 with clang 13.0.0. Fixes #28963.\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.mail-archive.com/tech@openbsd.org/msg63386.html",

Not locking cs_main while validating assumeutxo snapshots, so the node is responsive when the background chainstate download finishes.\r\n2. Deleting the background chainstate right away when it is no longer needed, instead of waiting until the next restart, which takes up extra disk space and slows down the next startup.",

          "body": "This suggests a strategy to run the functional tests with both v1 and v2 transport in the CI.\r\n\r\n**Status Quo:**\r\nThere is both the global `--v2transport` option for the `test_runner.py` (not enabled by default), plus the possibility to specify `--v2transport` for particular tests, which is used for a handful of tests. Currently, when running `test_runner.py --v2transport`, these tests are run twice with the same `--v2transport` configuration, as has been noted in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29358#discussion_r1485626063, which is wasteful.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Change:**\r\nFix this by adding a `--v1transport` option and using it in `test_runner.py`, so that irrespective of the global `--v2transport` flag, the  tests that run twice use v1 in one run and v2 in the other.\r\nAlso add `--v2transport` to one CI task (`multiprocess, i686, DEBUG`).\r\nThis means, that for each CI task, the majority of functional tests will run once using the global `--v2transport` option if provided, while a few selected tests will always run two times, once with `v1` and once with `v2`.\r\n\r\n**Rationale:**\r\nA simpler alternative would have been to remove all test-specific `--v2transport` commands from `test_runner.py` and just enable `--v2transport` option for a few CI tasks. I didn't do that because it would have meant that v2 would never be running in the CI for some platforms, and also be run a lot less locally by users and devs (who would have to actively enable the `--v2transport` option).
