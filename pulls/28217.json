Bloating the blocks with huge data streams is bad enough for full nodes, but bloating the UTXO set is worse and in the last 4 moths it has grown at an unprecedented 40%[^1] due to a tidal wave of BRC-20 transactions that pay more fees than sats they move just to inscribe small json payloads that are well below 10k bytes[^2].\r\n\r\nFortunately detecting these transactions does not involve decoding the script and looking for ASCII strings or some other patterns of data. It's as simple as detecting the `OP_0` `OP_IF` data envelope in the script, and an unofficial patch that does that has been circulating informally since early February[^3]. I see no reason why a more refined version of this patch (with proper unit tests etc) should not make its way into Bitcoin Core eventually, as it's the same kind of issue (and mitigation) we're dealing in here.\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://statoshi.info/d/000000009/unspent-transaction-output-set?orgId=1&refresh=5s&from=now-1y&to=now&viewPanel=8\r\n![utxo_set](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/1456708/2062707d-e256-46de-951c-d695966be4ef)\r\n\r\n[^2]: See for instance [this transaction](https://mempool.space/tx/6e463cf71ebc8a374fa4f43fb6c60ab16551ef666b4f72d67efaa8e88db8d1ca) and its [block](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000004261d7e1e194c3dd45c6f5d3e5c2d46268f0215a26280), which is filled with other BRC-20 inscriptions.

      "body": "I ran the numbers on bare multisig usage between blocks 700,000 and 800,000 (approx. last two years). Because most of bare multisig activity is never spent outputs, I focused on bare multisig inputs and how old the spent coins are.\r\n\r\nThere were 940 bare multisig inputs during the analyzed period. 28% of them were spending coins created in the same block, while the median coin age was 224 blocks, and 90% of the coins were 14,599 blocks or fewer old. So while the actual usage of bare multisig for transactions is low, it's not just people sweeping old wallets, and they would be negatively impacted by not being able to create new outputs.\r\n\r\nSo for now, assuming this change is adopted and the peer-to-peer network stops reliably relaying transactions creating bare multisig outputs, these appear to be the consequences:\r\n\r\n- People determined to store data in the UTXO set (which is a terrible idea, but they still do it) will move to a different output type (such as P2TR, or perhaps an unused 40-byte SegWit output type) with slightly lower encoding efficiency, with potentially worse consequences for the UTXO set size.\r\n- However, since the actual usage of bare multisig even for outputs is low, the actual consequences for the UTXO set are likely to be negligible either way.\r\n- A small minority of users who appear to actually be using bare multisig for transactions will be forced to move to a different output type.\r\n\r\nAs there don't appear to be any benefits of this change, it's a NACK from me.\r\n\r\nSide note, a proposal to change the default policy really should be accompanied (I'd even say preceded) by a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list.",

      "body": "Ignoring the unwarranted ad hominem. \r\n\r\nI have no desire to wade into what appears to be a bunch of meddling with the code base for no good reason (bare multsig outputs are not the cause of the increased spam, as I am sure you know).\r\n\r\nI will simply confirm that Samourai Wallet implements Version 1 of BIP47 which doesn't use bare multsig but rather OP_RETURN. There are at least 200,000 BIP47 payment codes (that users have opted in to uploading to a public web directory) in the wild across three independent wallets - with more coming I am told. \r\n\r\nRegarding version 3 payment codes, we have fully implemented Version 3 of BIP47 into our wallet library ExtLibJ for over a year. See test vectors here https://code.samourai.io/wallet/ExtLibJ/-/blob/develop/src/test/java/com/samourai/wallet/bip47/rpc/obpp05/TestVectorsOBPP_RFC05.java\r\n\r\nI don't think it is wise to assume that no one is using BIP47 Version 3, nor should it be expected that developers come pay homage and plead their case to the maintainers and contributors of this repository as was suggested earlier in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you @Davidson-Souza and @1ma for thinking of BIP47 in the context of this PR\r\n\r\nConcept NACK",

      "body": "### Alternative\r\n\r\n~~What about reducing the standardness to only accept uncompressed format public keys thus reducing the capacity to spam due to cost. This would roughly double the amount of data that someone would have to include in their tx making the data overhead prohibitively expensive to spam. The efficiency of data storage would also decrease since only 50% of the pubkey data would be usable (_the y component would not have valid data._ ) Since a compressed point is equal to a uncompressed point P2MS would be functionally equivalent for any developer or users that want to use P2MS as their custody solution. I also doubt anyone creating a standard P2MS or P2PK TX for monetary exchange would have any issue paying the overhead for their tx which would be a maximum of 96 bytes.~~\r\n\r\nEdit: This would not work since only size is checked as a part of is standard not validity of (x and Y) components of the pubkey.\r\n\r\n### Aside\r\nJust scraped my UTXO set using https://github.com/in3rsha/bitcoin-utxo-dump and filtered my set for only p2ms keeping all row data and the total size is 278MB which is incredibly small even compared to P2PKH which sits at 1.9GB\r\n\r\nHere are some sizes to show how little data has actually bloated the UTXO set using P2MS and P2PK, even P2PKH uses far more space at ~10x.  _*script is the size of the serialized data only_\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/3104223/7b025ffa-80b7-411d-9a38-99a6710dc6e5)\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Thank you for your input @samouraiwallet.\r\n\r\nI admit that when I gave my ACK I thought this change was a no-brainer (for the reasons @mikeinspace exposed above) and now I'm conflicted. I wasn't aware of BIP47 v3, and in my personal opinion it is a valid use case. I've reviewed the extent of the work you and others have done on it in the last years and I've realized how extremely pissed you and the more privacy-focused Bitcoin community must be about this proposed change.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to say that as a full node runner I'm about equally pissed that you designed and implemented a legit use case for storing data onchain that I need to keep in the UTXO set, especially since BIP47 and Whirlpool's Tx0 have always used OP_RETURN. If BIP47 v3 took off and there were tens of millions of BIP47 v3 notification transactions (which would arguably be a good thing for privacy) it would also contribute to worsen the UTXO set bloat problem for no good reason.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid our main goals and time horizons are fundamentally at odds on this issue, so I maintain my ACK. You should have more leeway in 2023 to redesign BIP47 v3 on top of OP_RETURN than I'll have in 2050 to run a full node if bare multisig data storage for legit use cases were to take off from here on.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nTo those who argue against the change on the grounds that bare multisig data storage is not so bad **today**, I'd say that it shows that not a lot of people have cared about it so far, and that it's better to unstandardize it while that's the case. On these grounds I also support @Semisol's suggestion to unstandardize P2PK outputs.\r\n\r\nI wasn't aware of the technical advantages of P2MS over P2SH/P2WSH pointed out by @russeree and they also seem a valid objection to me, but still @vostrnad showed that bona fide P2MS seems to happen very rarely in practice, so given the downsides I don't think they're compelling enough for me.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nIn general, regarding data embedding onchain I think that 80-byte OP_RETURNs are the Schelling point that all camps find tolerable (here I'm excluding self-professed Bitcoin adversaries such as Mike).\r\n\r\nEven a good chunk of the people who are opposed to adding new standardness rules claim to only do so because they fear unintended consequences, and because this feels like a never-ending \"cat and mouse\" game. However this is just one way to frame this situation.\r\n\r\nAnother way to frame the situation is that Mike, Casey et al are unsuspecting QA engineers working for Bitcoin Core for free, doing what essentially amounts to fuzz testing of the script interpreter. I don't see why Core cannot freeride on the countless hours they spend looking for contrived ways to embed data onchain to timely maintain an evolving set of standardness rules that nudge users towards OP_RETURN. There surely are talented people that'd like to work on that. The next step in proactiveness would be setting up bounties for finding novel data envelopes that evade the latest spam filters and disclose them responsibly, so that they can be unstandardized before they explode like `OP_0` `OP_IF` did. Maybe it'd be enough motivation for some of these spammers to turn white-hat and do their thing in testnet and signet instead of mainnet.\r\n\r\nFinally, there's the issue of potential full-on tidal wave of off-band spam with this approach. Personally I'm skeptical of the spammers' ability to actually weaponize the miners against the system. For one, even if they are profit-driven they are also some of the most invested entities in Bitcoin's success. For the other, if off-band spam really got to a point where it threatens the system I guess they'd jack up the off-band fees to a point where it evens out. However I can't back this up, it's just what seems more likely to me.",

Citing from the [OBPP5](https://github.com/OpenBitcoinPrivacyProject/rfc/blob/master/obpp-05.mediawiki):\r\n> Alice's wallet should spend the notification change output at the next appropriate opportunity.\r\n\r\nJustus Ranvier designed it that way so that these notifications are more block space efficient and do not create any waste UTXOs on notification addresses like v1 does. He also thought about when these notification outputs should be created so that there really is no waste:\r\n> Wallets SHOULD prefer to create of notification outputs in any situation where a change output is required, if the wallet knows of the existence of any payment codes but has not yet sent a notification.",

      "body": "The status of BIP0011 likely should be changed to ```obsolete``` or modified to reflect changes to enablement if or upon merge as well since it would no longer be applicable to Bitcoin as intended. Does a new BIP need to be constructed to obsolete [BIP0011?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0011.mediawiki) My position remains as NACK; none the less just brining about some of my thoughts and how they pertain if there was a merge.\r\n\r\nEdit: Digging deeper\r\n\r\n1. Technically there is not a need to replace a BIP to obsolete it. Per BIP002 ```When a Final BIP is no longer relevant, its status may be changed to Replaced or Obsolete (which is equivalent to Replaced). This change must also be objectively verifiable and/or discussed.```\r\n\r\n2. There is no precedent for obsoleting an 'active' BIP before. only BIP0064 has moved from draft->obsolete. \r\n\r\n3. The replaced option for the status of BIP0011 doesn't make sense unless there is a replacement for BIP11 outlining the reasons removing BIP0011 form isStandard improves BitCoin. **This doesn't make much sense because it would be a negation BIP**\r\n\r\n4. The context of BIP11 explicitly adding bare-multisig to isStandard() would force a change of status of the BIP if this got merged.\r\n\r\n_A personal thought: A BIP obsoleting change should have a larger and more diverse set of community discussion. Possibly even running it through the mailing list first. As it stands the ACKs/NACKs ratio doesn't even reach 2/3, currently at 64.5% ACK rate_\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit 2: Some additional thoughts and info** \r\n\r\n\r\nI ran some scripts against the stamps encoded P2MS transactions. Scraping the data of  74188 that were present at height 803187.\r\n\r\n![Figure_1e](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/3104223/7cfc0c80-78e7-4939-bf44-8f8573195a44)\r\n\r\n![Figure_1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/3104223/b332bc28-4662-406e-8406-d0acacaa23da)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit 3: For DraghtBot my stance is still NACK**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Noting a couple of them here with a solution at the bottom.\r\n\r\n> Although there was a debate in particular with the BIP47, we must not forget that some people like Mike are there only to protect their business with the src-20 and stamps. They absolutely do not care about the decentralization of Bitcoin and the consequences it has on the nodes.\r\n\r\nAd Hominem (Attacking a Person): Just because Mike has a business interest doesn't automatically invalidate his statement. In addition do we actually know if mike has a 'business' that is of focus in the first place?\r\n\r\nHasty Generalization: The above statement seems to assume that people like Mike \"absolutely do not care about the decentralization of Bitcoin and the consequences it has on the nodes\" without presenting sufficient evidence to justify such a broad generalization.\r\n\r\n> In addition, on your graph we see that the demand for stamps is much calmer, but absolutely nothing prevents a new wave of stamps. I think we must not wait for a new wave to act.\r\n\r\nAppeal to Fear:  The above statement's caution against waiting for a new wave to act is an attempt to persuade through fear rather than through logical conclusion.\r\n\r\n**Overall**\r\n\r\nThis discussion should stay as objective as possible using data, analytics, and critical thinking, precedent, historical evidence, and or other useful insights whilst removing emotions and personal attacks.\r\n\r\n### **Some additional corrections to the initial PRs content to avoid a double post.**\r\n\r\n> By refusing non-P2SH multisignature transactions from the outset, [...] \r\n\r\nThis is not true at all, firstly there are other types of multi-signature transactions such as P2WSH _(segwit)_ and P2TR _(taproot)_. The other element that is false would be stating \"By refusing [...] transactions from the outset\". This is not true at all since this would be a relay policy and only directs a node to how to handle a bare multisig transaction in terms of relaying and placing into it's own mempool. Bare-multisig TXs at the block validation level would not be refused and **refusing base-multisig from the UTXO set would require a softfork** \r\n",

      "body": "> * \"What if we do it in the worst way possible? What if we store it in the UTXO set?\"\r\n\r\nHe is wrong about this, the worst way possible would be to use P2PK instead of P2MS since it would increase the number of outpoints per arbitrary data TX by 3x. \r\n\r\n> @russeree, your response is a red herring because you're distracting from the fact that Mike openly states that he's _\"polluting the UTXO set\"_ with _\"toxic waste\"_:\r\n\r\nThis is actually a proper response, thanks citing sources and facts. My counter point is that it through evidence cited above regarding the type of 'bloat' (_toxic waste_) in the UTXO set. Using this line of thinking inscriptions should also be removed from isStandard becuase of the statements made at [Bitcoin 2023 \"The Great Ordinal Debate\"](https://youtu.be/AdYsQ2DWt5M?t=191) \"There is no value here ... it's like an objective crap\" while referring to inscriptions. \r\n\r\n> * \"I'm ruining bitcoin\"\r\n\r\nThis behavior was also demonstrated in the exact same piece reference above [The Great Ordinal Debate - Bitcoin 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdYsQ2DWt5M&t=80s) The act of proclaiming to break or tarnish Bitcoin is more a form of hubris rather than rooted in reality. \r\n\r\nThe effect of stamps bloat are minimal compared to inscriptions and ordinals in terms of the total number of items and amount data added to the UTXO set. This to me is likely because of the cost to use stamps instead of the discounted methods such as inscriptions.  Stamps has largely been unused on a per block basis for nearly 10k blocks yet the UTXO set still has a historically high rate of growth. Meaning the sources of bloat are coming from other types of transactions. Do you have data to show otherwise? \r\n\r\n**A personal opinion**. This is one person in all of Bitcoin. His statements may be bold and in some ways true but nonetheless there is context. Example when he discusses the 'toxic waste' he seems to be saying it more to agitate the inscriptions crowd and almost personifying the community of people who don't like inscriptions. As such if someone didn't like inscriptions, yes stamps would be much worse when looked at through the lens of data storage. He also mentions pre segwit nodes in his statement, that is less than .3% of the network right now. Making something look much bigger and important than it is.\r\n\r\n### Technical Reasoning this is not the best means to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThis PR as a measure to reduce the use of P2MS without the disabling of P2PK in the short term may cause even more bloat to the UTXO set in the short term as P2PK would likely be used as an alternative to P2MS and thus using 1 outpoint per pubkey instead of 1 outpoint per 3. \r\n\r\nSince this is a relay rule and not an actual consensus rule. To get around this in a way would be to recompile Bitcoin Core ```net.h``` with ```static const unsigned int DEFAULT_MAX_PEER_CONNECTIONS = 9999;``` or some incredibly high number in order to broadcast your TX and give it a higher chance of hitting a miner. This would mean your node would occupy more slots centralizing node running to a degree.\r\n\r\n",

Making the toxic waste more expensive is the objective of this PR.  \r\n\r\nIt's my belief that users committed to inflating the UTXO set via these mechanisms won't find the overhead of using P2PK problematic when trying to embed persistent, unprunable data into the timechain. P2MS was originally selected because it offered a cost-effective method to achieve this. If P2MS becomes inefficient or difficult to relay, the next logical choice would be P2PK. This would lead to an even faster inflation of the UTXO set.\r\n\r\n> all these exploitable quirks\r\n\r\nWhile definitions of what are 'quirks' are made with good intentions, they are not necessarily objective.

      "body": "@1ma \r\n\r\n> Then the next logical step is also making P2PK non-standard (preferably on the same release), as suggested by @Semisol in this thread.\r\n\r\nAnother vector that could be used to circumvent restrictions on p2ms or even p2pk relaying would be to use p2wsh.  Using a p2wsh tx outpoint would allow users to embed up to 256 bits (_32 bytes_) of arbitrary data per. These outpoints would also be unprunable. \r\n\r\nThe usable data storage capabilities of p2wsh are equal to p2pk with 32 bytes per outpoint. This would increase the number of required outpoints by 3x compared to p2ms. \r\n\r\nThe existence of p2wsh in this context makes restricting p2pk relaying a moot point. Which has been discussed. The same would apply for taproot outpoints. \r\n\r\n@Retropex \r\n> Precisely I made the request via [Bitcoin-dev](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-July/021805.html) and via an PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27589 (I know the PR are not intended for that)\r\n\r\nSorry, for my lack of clarity. My intention was to show that by using this evidence against one type of use case in Bitcoin. That same logic could/would be applied to other use cases in Bitcoin. One could attack Bitcoin by being boastful and arrogant about the way that they use Bitcoin, cause community outrage as a from of gathering consensus to change Bitcoin in a way that overall makes everyone worse off on longer time horizons.\r\n\r\n>\r\n> Unfortunately despite the fact that this is not an isolated request (almost) no developer has helped us on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe beauty is that you are the dev! In this PR you proposed code and an idea. Consensus is likely what you are truly after.",

The term \"unfortunately\" connotes a negative view on the situation, implying that the outcome or response (or lack thereof) from developers is unfavorable or less than desirable. \r\n\r\n> Unlike @petertodd who tried to remove a tool for nodes runner #28130, I want others to be implemented. \r\n\r\nHis solution when compared to yours side by side are very similar since his is also a modification of the default behavior with an additional command line override including a zero length for those who do not want to relay OP_RETURN. \r\n\r\n> I just want to have tools to give nodes runner the choice.\r\n\r\nThe tools are already in Bitcoin Core, these changes are modifying preferences for the default behavior. Much like a video game has a settings screen with siders and values that change the experience.\r\n\r\nNothing new has been developed for created, merely debating the best position for the default sliders to be in.

Much like a video game has a settings screen with siders and values that change the experience.\r\n> \r\n> Nothing new has been developed for created, merely debating the best position for the default sliders to be in.\r\n\r\nAlthough I agree with your last sentence, this is one more small attempt and step as I see it, of a node operator, to proactively DO SOMETHING that even if seamingly small, have an effect of tightening the circle around making hash-anchoring to Bitcoin a bit more CUMBERSOME, assuming NEW node operators will likely not be aware of what each default settings does at start. We all know that NEW node operators unfortunately are NOT popping up from everywhere every day, and only about 17.000 full nodes are currently supporting Bitcoin's network, estimated 0.0002% of users. So for me this is by far definitely a great initiative and we need actually also the coding of more options for full node SW, so operators can to be the ones to DECIDE what really is CORE (=PRIMARY SCOPE) to Bitcoin, as Bitcoin's decentralization is SUSTAINED by tyranically (Satoshi's term) keeping that CORE=CENTRAL the tiniest possible. Not Devs (=service providers, in conflict of interests).",

During our testing, we found that Hiro cannot sign PSBT transactions that include Bare MultiSig outputs (similar to the 2nd and 3rd outputs in this transaction: https://mempool.space/tx/5b05ce32451f80ba0beb8887a0ba901c3f1c553d594e72fce7d4d50c5b557c48). The error we encountered is shown in the following screenshot. \r\n\r\nCould you please assist us in understanding what may be causing this issue? \r\nBy the way, we have tested with the UniSat wallet and it is able to sign these transactions correctly. However, our first choice is still Hiro, so we hope that you can assist us in resolving this issue.

As such trying to attach arb. data to X and Y will cause that check to fail and the script won't be considered standard. This is why stamps uses uncompressed public keys.~~\r\n\r\nValidated that though stamps doesn't use uncompressed public keys. P2MS uncompressed pubkeys are valid even if the X and Y point do not lie on the SECP256K1 curve.

      "body": "> This should summarize this whole debate which started from `laser-eyed maxis` Twitter accounts virtue signaling on Twitter and calling for miners to not mine ordinal transactions in Q1-Q2 this year.\r\n> \r\n> `Bitcoin for me, but not for thee`. Respectfully, anyone who wants to dictate the `right` use of bitcoin for what I call frankly, the Church of Satoshi... needs to go and _kindly_... **fuck off**.\r\n> \r\n> You are turning out to be no better than the central bankers you demonize in the process.\r\n> \r\n> Innovation in BTC matters, but what we dictate as spam is no different than what the government considers `dis-information` or `mis-information`. Bitcoin is bitcoin, use it, or create your own CBDC with your morals & ethics in the code. We already have had many forks that have done so.\r\n> \r\n> Sincerely,\r\n> \r\n> A shitcoiner who actually respects Bitcoin for what it represents.\r\n\r\nCompletely confused argumentation. Bitcoin's decentralization dependents solely on its user and voluntary supporters=node operators. They decentralize decision, and therefore not dictate. What you or Devs in obvious conflict of interests want is to exploit their full nodes and use Bitcoin for something it was clearly not made for since it's decentralization dependents exactly of keeping its SCOPE PRIMARY AND TINY, and NOT become another CENTRALIZE DB. Node operators with their decentralized decision making, as the ONLY WITHOUT conflict of interests ARE the ones to be given option in their node operators to decide. This specific request is actually a very weak one, and just a tiny attempt  to keep closing the circle to hash-anchoring (=stamping) to Bitcoin, something it CANNOT DO SIMULTANEOUSLY with STAYING DECENTRALIZED.",

Secondly, on the basis of mempool consistency with miners, since full-rbf is the compatible policy in almost all cases, we should be supporting it by default if you take the position that we want to optimize for consistency with miners. (CC: @achow101) Thirdly, all previous arguments in favor of full-rbf, such as multiparty transactions, wallets, user-expectations, etc. still apply.\r\n\r\nThis simplification of mempool policy is well overdue. Let's get this merged and this silly debate over with. Miners and node operators who choose to disable full-rbf still can with a simple configuration change.\r\n\r\n",
