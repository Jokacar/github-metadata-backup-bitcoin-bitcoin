    "title": "GUI: Who is the GUI being designed for and how do we better avoid bikeshedding?",
    "body": "This is a brainstorming issue on the GUI. If I am missing context of past discussions on this please direct me to links (That is certainly possible, there have been years of discussions I am not aware of). I am opening this because I value my time and other contributors' time rather than because I am a regular user of the GUI (Disclaimer: I'm not but I have started reviewing some GUI related PRs and am interested in continuing to do so.)\r\n\r\nI am not a trained UX/UI designer but there appears to be some basic design principles when it comes to designing the GUI and providing feedback on GUI PRs that are being ignored on this project. Ideally we'll get some trained designers to start contributing to the project who can carry out basic feedback exercises to ensure GUI changes are informed and not subject to biases, bikeshedding etc\r\n\r\n1) Who are we designing the GUI for? Long term Core contributors (highly technical) that use the GUI on a regular basis? I don't know how many of these there are. Technically curious who use the GUI when they can't work out how to do something from the command line? Complete Bitcoin beginners? All of these groups? If it is the latter then we should all be under no illusions that compromises are necessary which will mean it is impossible for the design to be optimal for an individual group.\r\n\r\n2) Design preferences are subject to the \"sample size of 1\" trap where those reviewing GUI changes think they are providing feedback on behalf of a group that they don't belong to. A highly technical user just does not know what is optimal for a beginner. The only way you see what is optimal for a beginner is putting alternative GUIs in the hands of a statistically significant group of beginners. \r\n\r\nAn example open PR that motivated this issue is #16966. This is not picking on any of the people involved in that PR. When the project was smaller with fewer contributors there was no alternative other than individuals discussing their personal preferences. But at some stage (and certainly if we want the GUI to be used by greater numbers of users) we need a more effective collective thought process on this.\r\n\r\nI've reached out to some designers in the Bitcoin community and hopefully some of them will get involved in this discussion and/or review of future GUI PRs.\r\n",

          "body": "Implements #16954 for the current functionality + #16944 (`gui: create PSBT with watch-only wallet`). This PR splits the send screen into three tabs, like a wizard.\r\n\r\nThis frees up UI real estate where we can add support for PSBT, hardware wallets and education.\r\n\r\nI renamed `SendCoinsDialog` to `SendCompose` and `SendConfirmationDialog` to `SendSign`for clarity, which ended up (trivially) touching lots of `src/qt/locale/bitcoin_##.ts` files. This is contained in two move-only commits.\r\n\r\n**Tab 1: Draft**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"926\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2019-09-26 om 15 59 16\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/65695736-606d8b80-e078-11e9-84d9-fe2d37f932e8.png\">\r\n\r\nSame as the current send screen: enter destination, do coin selection, set fee etc. This can be split further in future PRs for a less cluttered experience, e.g. one tab for coin selection (if enabled), one for destination(s) and one for fees. Having a separate tab for fees also provides an entry point for RBF, which currently doesn't let the user pick an amount. \r\n\r\n**Tab 2: Sign**\r\n\r\nThis asks to unlock the wallet if needed.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"931\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2019-09-26 om 16 14 42\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/65695992-c9ed9a00-e078-11e9-9ee7-4d60d0499049.png\">\r\n\r\nDisplay transaction details like the current popup does. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"933\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2019-09-26 om 15 59 35\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/65695773-6fecd480-e078-11e9-95fa-498f844c5eb1.png\">\r\n\r\nEdit jumps back to Draft. Send jumps to Finish, unless something goes wrong.\r\n\r\nBump fee jumps straight to this tab:\r\n<img width=\"855\" alt=\"sign\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/65713022-89057d80-e098-11e9-80d5-0a2abdde0871.png\">\r\n\r\nFor watch-only wallets it displays the same text as #16944.\r\n\r\n**Tab 3: Finish**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"932\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2019-09-26 om 16 08 21\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/65695799-7b400000-e078-11e9-967a-7581f15ecdd5.png\">\r\n\r\nThis is where the actual broadcast takes place, or where the PSBT is copied to the clipboard. In a followup we can add support for saving the PSBT to disk, or for copying a signed transaction hex to clipboard if the user wants to broadcast that elsewhere. \r\n\r\nBump fee shows both the previous and new transaction index:\r\n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"sent\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/65713060-9c184d80-e098-11e9-879a-f10822d4ad2b.png\">\r\n\r\nThe manual \"Show\" button has the nice side-effect of fixing #16875 / #16876 in two out of three places. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n- [ ] clean up WalletModelTransaction and CoinControl object passing mess\r\n- [x] restore test\r\n\r\nFollowups:\r\n* add PSBT export to Sign tab (extract from gwillen's branch https://github.com/gwillen/bitcoin/tree/feature-offline-v2, i.e. redo #16944)\r\n* add Load PSBT menu option, jump to Broadcast tab if complete, otherwise to Sign tab\r\n* list connected hardware wallets in Sign tab (redo #16549 \r\n* split fee selection into its own tab\r\n* allow custom RBF amounts: bump fee should jump to fee selection tab \r\n",

Bitcoin is very much like industrial GUIs, in that safety is a primary concern. Mistakes are generally irreversible, and costly. Which is why I tend to discourage the \"cool gui\" kind of designers. Making the GUI look cool or fashionable is not the point, and never was.\r\n\r\nTrained designers that have worked on projects with a lot at stake, and understand human psychology in that context, would definitely be welcome. It does mean that some developer has to communicate with them. and implement their ideas, or it's not going to work. I do not personally have time to do serious work on the GUI anymore.",

The traffic doesn't really matter. But they're interested enough to run the software virtually 24/7.\r\n\r\n> They have the ability to use bitcoin-cli but using the GUI is somehow faster for them?\r\n\r\nI think that's a significant part, yes. They might be able to use bitcoin-cli or the console, but might also be scared of it (easy to make mistakes!), or use the GUI because it's more convenient.\r\n\r\nI think that's a realistic aim. Maybe at some point in the future Bitcoin Core will be suitable for non-technical beginners, but it's important to not focus on that at actual user's expense. E.g. by removing features that people care about. GNOME comes to mind.\r\n\r\nAlso whatever the designer wants need to work in the context of Qt. The project is not going to switch to a web GUI like electron. A lot is possible with [QML](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16883) though.\r\n",

So if your requirement is to run a full node (even if it is just booted once a month to pay for a bill), the GUI is a candidate try out.\r\n\r\nGiven that parts of the GUI \"wrap\" the RPC interface, some tooltips and confirmation dialogs (which are needed to prevent costly mistakes as pointed out by @laanwj), as well as warnings or errors tend to be technical. Thus, the GUI is maybe less accessible to users than a mobile wallet.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current situation should not prevent us from shipping a GUI that is just as easy to use as a mobile wallet. The long term plan to move the GUI to a separate repository makes it also possible to have multiple GUIs, each of which resonates with a different user base.",

Perform a fresh installation of Bitcoin Core on a computer which is ready for full disk wiping.\r\n\r\n2. Launch Bitcoin Core, then wait for it to sync.\r\n\r\n3. Unplug the ethernet cable. For laptops, the WiFi/BT module should also been dismantled.\r\n\r\n4. Import the \"precious\" private key with `importprivkey`. Wait for the rescan to be done.\r\n\r\n5. Compose & sign the transaction with the wallet GUI. The imported \"precious private key\" would obviously be reused by specifying \"custom change address\" (otherwise it would be just another tragedy like #11827). Then copy the raw transaction data.\r\n\r\n6. Use QR code or USB thumb drive to carry out raw transaction data. Then the transaction could be broadcasted to the network.\r\n\r\n7. Erase the hard drive completely.",

      "body": "My personal view and projections on the GUI:\r\n\r\n1. I think we should not give up the hope to make Bitcoin Core a wallet for non experienced users\r\n2. Things like hybrid SPV mode (#9483), pruning and block-filter based p2p-fetch wallet rescans could make things way more attractive for novice users\r\n3. On top, resource management could be done better. Use full, heavy CPU resources only if the user is AFK or if he/she intentionally allows Bitcoin Core to draw all resources. Otherwise the system may get really unusable for a few hours on a catch-up/sync. Sometimes the time to catch up a few days of blocks is irrelevant but the user prefers to have enough resources available to watch a movie or do some word processing, etc.\r\nRight now the default approach is **sync as fast as possible**. Which may be desirable for server based VPS, etc. But often not for home/personal desktop systems. \r\n4. I agree with @laanwj that the GUI doesn't need to be a super-modern HTML/CSS whatever. It needs to fulfil its job. Clear communication, simple to extend (Qt/cross platform), minimal resource needs (no HTML/CSS/JS).\r\n5. However, there are many things that need more love. Among many ideas, a new wizard that helps people setting up the right configuration (pruning, blockfilters, maxscripthreads, etc.) in a way that is really simple to understand, would be one of the things that non experience users would appreciate.\r\n\r\nIf I would have some wishes open, one of them would be that the GUI works perfectly asynchronous over the RPC interface with a push channel like long-polling (#7949). I'm pretty convinced that this approach should work also for performance critical stuff.\r\nAnd not least, it would allow to use the GUI via a wireguard/VPN (run the GUI on a different machine) and the modularity would allow other GUIs / backends.",

For example, the following information is not retrievable through RPC:\r\n\r\n* Initial boot-up messages that get reported through `InitMessages`\r\n* Header-first sync progress\r\n* The location of the data directory\r\n* The location of the `blocks/` folder\r\n\r\nWhen building [Orange](https://github.com/orange-org/orange) I worked around these limitations by retrieving some of this information from the log output. But that's a hack that I would like to be able to fix.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that I found tricky to build by relying purely on RPC is the [logic that sets the text for the `progressBarLabel`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/95ca6aeec7b8d9dbf39e3a036a5c238634ce3793/src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp#L938)\r\n\r\nWe can probably fix these limitations by adding more data/commands to the RPC interface. What do you think about that?",

      "body": "Some thoughts from @Sjors on Twitter (https://twitter.com/provoost/status/1257603593487687681?s=20):\r\n\r\nSome changes are easy. Fixing an obvious bug, improving performance or adding a feature that's tucked away in a menu.\r\n\r\nNot loudly publishing a change can make it easier to get it done, but defeats the purpose of peer review, and can lead to followups that partly undo it.\r\n\r\nGenerally comments from regular contributors have more weight when they disagree with a change on non-technical grounds, so the total amount of \"bikeshedding\" isn't the biggest issue. Some of the best technical reviewers strongly disagree on UX choices, that's a bigger bottleneck\r\n\r\nThis problem is made worse by how hard it is to change anything in the code, partly because QT isn't easy to work with, partly because the GUI codebase just isn't very nice, with lots of quick hacks. So a simple change can be a lot of effort, with high risk of dying in review.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me back to my usual view on how to get out of this mess:\r\n1. make GUI code so modular that people can work on independent implementations (that Core can cherry-pick from)\r\n2. clean up GUI code so proposing a change is less expensive\r\n3. stick to incremental UI changes\r\n\r\nKnots is a clear example of this in progress. It has all sorts of UI improvements, which @luke-jr can make at his own disgression. But cherry-picked features from that project sometimes take forever to make it through review. Perhaps the above can make that easier.\r\n\r\n",

Now that the GUI is primarily connected through interfaces with a bitcoin node, it seems an appropriate time to revive this discussion.\r\n\r\nBefore looking for solutions, we should define a set of goals that we want to achieve. I will start with some ideas to get started and I hope that others will chime in to share and prioritize their goals.\r\n\r\n### Separate issue and patch management\r\n\r\nIt is currently not possible to subscribe to only a subset of modules in Bitcoin Core, or exclude modules from issue and patch notifications. While it is possible to reactively mute conversations in the stream of all ongoing discussions, there is no way to proactively achieve this. Moreover, the list of open issues and pull request will always include GUI related ones by default. Only with [filters](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+-label%3AGUI) it is possible to hide them.\r\n\r\n### More focused review and interests\r\n\r\nLong term goals of the GUI are partially unclear #17395 . Bitcoin Core developers are generally fluent on the command line. Thus, they might not be interested or motivated to review improvements to the GUI, which might not affect their workflow on the command line at all.  Splitting up the GUI will hopefully attract similar minded people to a project whose primary goal is to build and improve the GUI.\r\n\r\n### Maintain high quality assurance\r\n\r\nThe quality of the GUI (and even more importantly Bitcoin Core in general) must not degrade. This means that code review itself is not negatively affected by splitting the GUI, but also the integration of the GUI into the rest of Bitcoin Core. One issue could arise when arbitrary version-combinations are allowed. We are struggling hard to test against all supported versions of Boost. Making the GUI version another dimension is going to make testing impossible.\r\n\r\n### The GUI *is* Bitcoin Core\r\n\r\nWhen a user downloads Bitcoin Core from our website (or another package manager) they expect the GUI to be included. This should not change (at least not as a result of splitting up the GUI into another project).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when building Bitcoin Core, the gui should still be built when `--with-gui` is specified.",

Everything stays the same, the development process for the GUI changes slightly.\r\n\r\nLong version:\r\n* An exact mirror of the master development branch is hosted at `bitcoin-core/gui`. The new repository is used to track gui-only issues and pull requests. Global changes that happen to touch gui code still go to the *main* repo.\r\n* All pull requests will be merged into `bitcoin/bitcoin`.\r\n* Decision making process and maintainers will be identical for both repos.\r\n\r\n### Disadvantages\r\n\r\n* Review activity might decrease?\r\n\r\n* It doesn't go far enough. bitcoin/bitcoin#3440 is proposing a modularized Bitcoin Core. The GUI could be an \"add-on\", connected over RPC or capnproto (bitcoin/bitcoin#10102). Thus, the gui could even be hosted as a subtree or completely separate project.\r\n\r\n### Advantages\r\n\r\n* Review activity might increase? It is impossible to predict the future, but for example the `libsecp256k1` subtree has a lot of domain specific experts, maintainers and reviewers. I think longer term it makes sense to at least try this route for the gui as well.\r\n\r\n* A smaller step is easier to undo when it turns out to come with any unforeseen downsides.\r\n\r\n* No substantial changes to the decision making progress.\r\n\r\n* Nothing changes in how developers set up their dev environment or how users build from the source. Also, the release binaries and process will stay exactly the same. No version drift. Finally, code sharing between the GUI and Bitcoin Core is not made any harder.\r\n\r\n* The organizational side. There are 72 open issues (~14%) and 61 open PRs (~16%) with the GUI label. If moved to its own repo, non-GUI developers wouldn't have to be distracted with GUI-only issues and PRs and GUI enhancements. GUI developers have their own repo to focus on GUI development exclusively.\r\n\r\n### Implementation (outstanding TODOs)\r\n\r\n* Adjust maintainer merge script https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools/pull/57\r\n* Create bitcoin-core/gui repository (empty or with master branch only)\r\n* Assign all existing bitcoin core maintainers to the new repo\r\n* Celebrate? :partying_face:\r\n\r\n* Long-term: Think how long the grace period is for existing GUI related issues and pull requests. Issues can be transferred with a script after a grace period of some months?",

There's some commits here that can cleaned up, squashed or dropped.\r\n\r\nIf you're compiling macOS, `make appbundle` will (as before) build a dynamically linked `Bitcoin Core.app`. `make deploy` will still build a statically linked `dist/Bitcoin Core.app` and will now also create a `dist/Bitcoin-Core.zip`.\r\n\r\nCompiling on Linux there has never been a `make appbundle` rule, and with these changes, `make deploy` now behaves the same as on macOS. The `make deploydir` rule has  been removed. \r\n\r\nInitially I  was unconvinced (of a swap from .dmg to .zip), however I have come around after looking at these changes. If there is not agreement that \"this is the way\", then I'll revive #18151 and fix it up to include `xorriso` in depends etc.",

          "title": "Who is the GUI being designed for? -Continued Discussion-",
          "body": "I'd like to continue the discussion from [#17395](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17395) over at the bitcoin repo started by @michaelfolkson. \r\n\r\nThe two questions posed by Michael a long with summarized replies from the original thread are below. As someone who is interested in contributing to the design of the GUI I've also included some of my own opinions throughout. \r\n\r\n> 1. Who are we designing the GUI for? Long term Core contributors (highly technical) that use the GUI on a regular basis? I don't know how many of these there are. Technically curious who use the GUI when they can't work out how to do something from the command line? Complete Bitcoin beginners? All of these groups? If it is the latter then we should all be under no illusions that compromises are necessary which will mean it is impossible for the design to be optimal for an individual group.\r\n\r\n> 2. Design preferences are subject to the \"sample size of 1\" trap where those reviewing GUI changes think they are providing feedback on behalf of a group that they don't belong to. A highly technical user just does not know what is optimal for a beginner. The only way you see what is optimal for a beginner is putting alternative GUIs in the hands of a statistically significant group of beginners.\r\n\r\n- The GUI is intended for 'power users,' not beginners, intermediate or devs. Power users being those who are technically competent to run their own node, have basic CLI skills, but are still more comfortable with a simpler UI.\r\n\r\nI think devs also fall within the user base albeit not as frequent as the power users (say if the dev wants to do a simple task in a few clicks). Over time and with good design we can include all users (see below).\r\n\r\n- In the future the GUI should also include beginners and intermediate users, although not at the expense of removing important features or negatively impacting security, privacy, control etc. \r\n\r\nI don't see this as an issue as good design should be able to cater to both experienced and inexperienced users. As an example see [this exchange](https://medium.com/lgogroup/introducing-lgos-trading-interface-77967e4e108e) which offers different interfaces for differing user skills - taken from [crypto UX handbook](https://www.cryptouxhandbook.com/user-onboarding). Good usability is synonymous with good security - Casa articulates this much better in their [wealth security protocol.](https://docs.keys.casa/wealth-security-protocol/system-design-principles/usability-is-security) \r\n\r\n- The GUI does not need to be flashy / modern looking.\r\n\r\nI agree with this but this is in many ways unrelated to good design. A flashy look can increase usability is not synonymous with Aesthetics. As long as its fulfills its job thats all the matters. At this stage that job being having any level of user being able to run a node and have a wallet attached to that node (whether wallet features are used in the GUI or \r\n\r\n- Designers need to work within the constraints of Qt.\r\n\r\nGood point to make but I don't think the constraints are as big as made out to be in the original thread. As Christoph Ono, who worked on the designs for the Monero GUI which also uses Qt, pointed out a small team managed to revamp the UI/UX of the GUI over a few years without too many issues, see [here](https://github.com/GBKS/monero-wallet-design). @GBKS \r\n\r\n- Having a modular GUI / multiple implementations to cater to different user bases.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above I think good design can cater to all audiences within the same app, having a modular GUI is not an efficient way to go about things in my opinion.  \r\n\r\n- What is the main purpose of the GUI? _\"Note that the GUI is needed for more than just the wallet... right now, it is the only realistic way for a normal end user to run their own node at all.\"_ @luke-jr \r\n\r\nLuke also mentions \"...Bitcoin's security depends on a super-majority of the economy using their own full node.\" This isn't possible without including beginner and intermediate users which can only be done through well articulated design. \r\n\r\nAlthough this will likely be a controversial take, is the discontinuation of the GUI once enough options exist outside of core for users to run a fully validating node an option? Projects such as [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel) and [myNode](https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode) are good examples of non-GUI fully validating nodes. If these become more popular among users for running a node than the GUI, is the resources put into it worthwhile when they could be applied to making bitcoins foundations even stronger?\r\n\r\n- Many usability improvements are being worked on on the technical side - [1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16966) [2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9483) [3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7949)\r\n\r\nWith initiatives such as [Bitcoin Design](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign) and [square crypto design grants](https://medium.com/@squarecrypto/bringing-together-the-bitcoin-design-community-b89e5fbe080f) on offer, many more designers are likely to start contributing to open source bitcoin projects like the GUI. It's important that discussions like this happen so that designers and devs are on the same page. \r\n\r\nI'd encourage devs to join the [bitcoin design slack](https://join.slack.com/t/bitcoindesign/shared_invite/zt-fv00xzev-mfHaAsexPsu~QBlufPxL~g) and for designers to frequent this repo and join in on discussions when they can. \r\n",
