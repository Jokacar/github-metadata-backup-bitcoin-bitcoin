    "title": "Remove libevent as a dependency (HTTP / cli / torcontrol)",
    "body": "## Immediate advantages\r\n### UNIX domain sockets for JSON-RPC\r\n- Old feature request: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/5029\r\n- UNIX sockets have been added to [ZMQ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27679) and [Tor proxy](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27375) already \r\n- UNIX sockets with libevent [doesn't work](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/5029#issuecomment-2203469108)\r\n### Remove a dependency\r\n- libevent hasn't had a release since 2020\r\n- The [xz utils backdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor) raised some concern among contributors in the [2024/04/18 IRC meeting](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2024-04-18.html#l-198)\r\n\r\n## Current libevent usage in the project\r\nSee [this report](https://gist.github.com/fjahr/c0c339a4b5021ae815d5bcff42e9fc57) by @fjahr. A few of these have already been addressed, like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29904\r\n\r\n## Strategies\r\n\r\nI am starting by replacing the HTTP server, currently used for both REST and JSON-RPC and implemented with libevent. Nothing is quite ready for review yet but I have:\r\n\r\n### https://github.com/pinheadmz/bitcoin/tree/http-netbase-cmake\r\n\r\nStill lots of TODOs and new tests to write but works and passes all current tests. In this branch I added a new `http.cpp` module with socket-handling code largely copied from `ConnMan`. This branch needs a lot of clean up before presenting as a PR with clear commits.\r\n\r\n### https://github.com/pinheadmz/bitcoin/tree/http-rewrite\r\n\r\nThis branch I am trying to write much more cleanly for PR presentation. It is based on #30988 by @vasild which cleanly separates the generic socket handling logic from the bitcoin protocol logic. It would be especially useful if there was any more future need for additional servers in bitcoin (such as @Sjors recently withdrawn proposal to add StratumV2: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/68)\r\n\r\n## Looking for feedback\r\n\r\n1. Is this something worth doing at all?\r\n    - We could vendor libevent instead of requiring it as a dependency, and fix UNIX sockets there\r\n    - There might be another C++ HTTP library we could import instead. I did shop around a bit but everything I found was just a bit too much.\r\n3. If(1) do we want to share generic sock manager code or have it mostly duplicated between p2p and http?",

I think the conclusion in that issue was that vcpkg should probably stop shipping unstable/unreleased code, and I don't think we care about fuzzing unreleased versions of dependencies. It's less suprising that code which is still in development / might have API or other breaking changes we haven't accounted for might not work correctly.",
