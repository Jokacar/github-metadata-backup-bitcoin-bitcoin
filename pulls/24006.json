    "body": "This is part of the [assumeutxo project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/11) (parent PR: #15606) \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the necessary changes for indexing to work with the operation of a background validation chainstate. In short, it\r\n- only emits existing ValidationInterface events for the active chain,\r\n- introduces a BackgroundBlockConnected event for the background chain to support indexation, and\r\n- removes assumptions in the indexing framework that indexation will happen sequentially.\r\n\r\nMore details below.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdds BackgroundBlockConnected to the validationinterface and uses it in\r\nindex maintenance. Ensures that index building will work when part of\r\nthe chain is validated asynchronously in the background by a second\r\nchainstate.\r\n\r\nThis changeset removes the guarantee that indexes will be built\r\nsequentially, as none of the current indexes require this and it is no\r\nlonger easy to offer this guarantee when multiple chainstates are in\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nWithin BaseIndex, we only update `m_best_block_index` (which is\r\nessentially the progress marker for how far along the indexing process\r\nis) for chains which we can be certain that all blocks under a given\r\nblock on that chain have had indexing performed on them.  In other\r\nwords, we will not update `m_best_block_index` during a BlockConnected\r\nevent that comes from an active snapshot chain, i.e. a chain for which\r\nsome of the blocks underneath Tip() are not indexed.\r\n\r\nOnce background validation is completed and no background chainstates\r\nare in use, the indexer will happily use BlockConnected events from the\r\nactive chain to update `m_best_block_index` as usual. No blocks from the\r\nactive chainstate will have been missed for indexing (despite not\r\npreviously updating m_best_block_index), so it is safe to perform this\r\ntransition without any extra behavior.\r\n\r\nSome unnecessary logic from BaseIndex::ChainStateFlushed() is removed,\r\nsince the locator can no longer be assumed to be an ancestor of the\r\nbest_block_index (since the \"best block\" may be on a background chainstate\r\nand the locator may have come from an assumed-valid tip well ahead of\r\nit).",

Ensures that index building will work when part of\nthe chain is validated asynchronously in the background by a second\nchainstate.\n\nThis changeset removes the guarantee that indexes will be built\nsequentially, as none of the current indexes require this and it is no\nlonger easy to offer this guarantee when multiple chainstates are in\nuse.\n\nWithin BaseIndex, we only update `m_best_block_index` (which is\nessentially the progress marker for how far along the indexing process\nis) for chains which we can be certain that all blocks under a given\nblock on that chain have had indexing performed on them.  In other\nwords, we will not update `m_best_block_index` during a BlockConnected\nevent that comes from an active snapshot chain, i.e. a chain for which\nsome of the blocks underneath Tip() are not indexed.\n\nOnce background validation is completed and no background chainstates\nare in use, the indexer will happily use BlockConnected events from the\nactive chain to update `m_best_block_index` as usual. No blocks from the\nactive chainstate will have been missed for indexing (despite not\npreviously updating m_best_block_index), so it is safe to perform this\ntransition without any extra behavior.\n\nSome unnecessary logic from BaseIndex::ChainStateFlushed() is removed,\nsince the locator can no longer be assumed to be an ancestor of the\nbest_block_index (since the \"best block\" may be on a background chainstate\nand the locator may have come from an assumed-valid tip well ahead of\nit).",

This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Original change description\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with assumeutxo, here's a brief summary from [the issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15605) (where any conceptual discussion not specific to this implementation should happen):\r\n\r\n> assumeutxo would be a way to initialize a node using a headers chain and a serialized version of the UTXO state which was generated from another node at some block height. A client making use of this UTXO \"snapshot\" would specify a hash and expect the content of the resulting UTXO set to yield this hash after deserialization. \r\n> \r\n> This would allow users to bootstrap a usable pruned node & wallet far more quickly (and with less disk usage) than waiting for a full initial block download to complete, since we only have to sync blocks between the base of the snapshot and the current network tip. Needless to say this is at expense of accepting a different trust model, though how different this really ends up being from `assumevalid` in effect is worth debate.\r\n\r\nIn short, this is an interesting change because it would allow nodes to get up and running within minutes given a ~3GB file (at time of writing) under an almost identical trust model to assumevalid.\r\n\r\nIn this implementation, I add a few RPC commands: `dumptxoutset` creates a UTXO snapshot and writes it to disk, and `loadtxoutset` intakes a snapshot from disk, constructs and activates chainstate based on it, and continues a from-scratch initial block download in the background for the sole purpose of validating the snapshot. Once the snapshot is validated, we throw away the chainstate used for background validation.\r\n\r\nThe assumeutxo procedure as implemented is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A UTXO snapshot is loaded with the `loadtxoutset <path>` RPC command.\r\n1. A new chainstate (`CChainState`) is initialized using `ChainstateManager::ActivateSnapshot()`:\r\n   1. The serialized UTXO data is read in and various sanity checks are performed, e.g. compare expected coin count, recompute the hash and compare it with assumeutxo hash in source code.\r\n   1. We \"fast forward\" `new_chainstate->m_chain` to have a tip at the base of the snapshot (with or without block data). Lacking block data, we fake the `nTx` counts of the constituent `CBlockIndex` entries.\r\n   1. `LoadChainTip()` is called on the new snapshot and it is installed as our active chainstate.\r\n1. The new assumed-valid chainstate is now our active, and so that enters IBD until it is synced to the network's tip. Presumably the snapshot would be taken relatively close to the current tip but far enough away to avoid meaningful reorgs, say 10,000 blocks deep.\r\n1. Once the active chainstate is out of IBD, our old validation chain continues IBD \"in the background\" while the active chainstate services requests from most of the system.\r\n1. Once the background validation chainstate reaches a height equal the base of the snapshot, we take the hash of its UTXO set and ensure it equals the expected hash based on the snapshot. If the hashes are equivalent, we delete the validation chainstate and move on without event; if they aren't, we log loudly and fall back to the validation chainstate (we should probably just shut down).\r\n\r\nThe implicit assumption is that the background validation chain will always be a subset of the assumed-valid snapshot chain while the latter is active. We don't properly handle reorgs that go deeper than the base of the snapshot.\r\n\r\n### Changes (already merged/outdated)\r\n\r\n![chainstate-beforeafter (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/54435797-a16b0780-4707-11e9-89c3-c90b5686804d.png)\r\n \r\nThe crux of this change is in removing any assumptions in the codebase that there is a single chainstate, i.e. any references to global variables `chainActive`, `pcoinsTip`, et al. need to be replaced with functions that return the relevant chainstate data at that moment in time. This change also takes `CChainState` to its logical conclusion by making it more self-contained - any references to globals like `chainActive` are removed with class-local references (`m_chain`).\r\n\r\nA few minor notes on the implementation:\r\n\r\n- When we attempt to load a wallet with a BestBlock locator lower than the base of a snapshot and the snapshot has not yet been validated, we refuse to load the wallet.\r\n\r\n- For additional notes, see [the new assumeutxo docs](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/blob/utxo-dumpload-compressed/doc/assumeutxo.md).",

The need for this manual reset (AFAICT) arises out of the fact that many of these globals are closely related to the block index (hence `::UnloadBlockIndex`), and need to be reset with it.\r\n\r\nI've shot this \"manual reset\" gun at my foot several times while doing the de-globalize chainman work.\r\n\r\nThankfully, now that we have a `BlockManager` class that owns the block index, these globals should be moved under that class so that they can live and die with the block index. These moves, along with making the block index non-heap-based, eliminates:\r\n1. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3585b521392c5b2c855c3ba6dc9b7d2a171b3710 The need to reason about when we need to manually call `::UnloadBlockIndex` (this decision can at times seem almost arbitrary)\r\n2. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f741623c25455c20bff9eb1ddd10a4ac84dc5655 The need to have an `::UnloadBlockIndex` or explicit `~ChainstateManager` at all",

Or do we store the increment and infer the value for each block on the fly?\r\n\r\nIt works like this in the index but since the MuHash is just a representation of a UTXO set and does not commit to a previous state you can \"jump in\" at any point in the chain and calculate the MuHash at any height by looking only at the UTXO set (inefficient because the full set has to be processed) and then from this point on work with the deltas (=blocks) as usual (efficient). Because of this it is also possible to calculate the MuHash at the tip without the index, it just takes a while. I haven't looked at the code in detail yet but just skimming I think the code for this starting of the coinstatsindex at any height is not included yet, right? But since assumeutxo supplies the UTXO set and its corresponding height this should be possible to build this in a follow-up.\r\n\r\nBut I agree with Sjors' question on the conceptual level: do we really need the indices to sync already right away on the blocks between the au height and tip or is it not maybe simpler to have the indices only sync with the background chain? Syncing the blocks between au and tip first we could serve blockfilters at the tip right away, which is nice, but if there is ever an issue with an incorrect snapshot then we make it other people's problem too because we are serving incorrect blockfilters.",

Thought I'd checked that but apparently not: https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/blob/e84248814296b82d926f5018dd62d917ddefe626/src/index/coinstatsindex.cpp#L118-L121\r\n\r\nA few options that come to mind:\r\n- we can defer indexation until there is are no assumed-valid chainstates in use (as @fjahr suggested as I was typing this), or\r\n- we can introduce an `m_requires_sequential` member variable to `BaseIndex` that does the above, but only for indexes that require it. This is kind of an optimized version of the first option.",
