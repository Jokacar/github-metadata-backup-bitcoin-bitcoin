    "title": "validation: CheckBlockIndex can fail in combination with pruning",
    "body": "Found this situation while fuzzing validation / `CheckBlockIndex()`:\r\n\r\n1) Full block C (child) is received, so `nTx`, but not `m_chain_tx_count` will be set because we only know the header of the previous block P (parent).\r\n2) Block C gets pruned\r\n3) We request / receive full data for parent P.\r\n4) Error in `CheckBlockIndex()` - multiple checks in `CheckBlockIndex()` fail, for example we expect `m_chain_tx_count` to be set for C.\r\n\r\nThere is a simple functional test to trigger this in https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/commit/b75577544c8f9e7e2b90d269de2a6d9bec438433.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly a theoretical issue:\r\n- we don't usually request parents of already pruned blocks like in step 3, unless we do `getblockfrompeer` or similar - so it can't be triggered remotely\r\n- also, situations where we have full data for a child block but no data for the parent tend to not persist for long.\r\n- `CheckBlockIndex` is not active by default on mainnet\r\n\r\nHowever I think it's good to understand the possible constellations in validation in depth and formulate our expectations (i.e. `CheckBlockIndex`) accordingly.",
