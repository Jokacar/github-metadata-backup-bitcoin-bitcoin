    "title": "Address changes should be visible to the user",
    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI lost a significant amount of bitcoin because bitcoinqt made transactions I never gave permission to: address changes. I assumed this software was unix-like, that basically it was good software. But because of the address changes, which are not signalled to the user, it is not.\r\n\r\nIssue:\r\n\r\nBitcoin private keys are artefacts of the bitcoin network. This is what the user own and is entitled too when he gets bitcoin.\r\nBitcoin wallets are NOT artefacts of the network, they are not part of the network at all. From the point of view of the network, they are artefact of a 3rd party software. The user may use them, but he doesnt own bitcoin because he owns a wallet, the user owns bitcoins because he owns private keys.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when bitcoinqt makes transaction - address changes - without warning the user, it is a clear breach of unix-like trust - for a lack of better terms.\r\n\r\nBitcoinqt should be unix-like. It should be fully transparent to the user, and not try to appeal to the mass. It should not be up to another software to fulfill that role.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nJust make the address changes visible.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nI can understand the mistake has been made at the beginning of bitcoin. Bitcoin was supposed to appeal to the mass in order to be used in mass consumption. It is still a mistake, but it is understandable. Today, we know it will never be used to buy a macdonald meal (beside the use of 3rd party software which make you think you do).",

Otherwise, maybe extending the documentation for importprivkey?\r\n\r\nPlease dont waste your time because of my ignorance :)\r\n\r\nThat being said, I think I've found that it is missing a unix-an doc that answers question like: \"how do you own bitcoins?\". In that case, when I look at a wallet, it awfully looks like a 3rd-party software artefact, whereas private keys looks like the thing I should only worry about. I now understand that you own bitcoins by owning a wallet and thats because, actually, of those change addresses. Correct me if Im wrong but if you \"remove\" the change addresses, you \"remove\" the wallets. Im not suggesting you should actually remove change addresses which makes no sense, I understand now the tech works like this; all Im saying is that wallets are here because change address are here, the whole thing being rooted in the tech. That defines wallets (how many users, particularly the tech savvy ones, could tell what wallets are really for?). A unix-an want to learn that quickly, during his user experience.\r\nAlso, I think it's missing some unix-an hints of whats happening during bitcoin core execution: I would expect to literally see the change address mechanism for each transactions, importprivkey included. Right now, importprivkey output things on the console (a \"null\") but doesnt output anything on the app. The app should log visibly everything that's happening, I think. When you grep or curl or whatever, you get to see everything right? :)\r\n\r\nAnyway, ultimately, Im sure those information are available somewhere, therefore the mistake is on me.",

      "body": "> Correct me if Im wrong but if you \"remove\" the change addresses, you \"remove\" the wallets. Im not suggesting you should actually remove change addresses which makes no sense, I understand now the tech works like this; all Im saying is that wallets are here because change address are here, the whole thing being rooted in the tech. That defines wallets (how many users, particularly the tech savvy ones, could tell what wallets are really for?).\r\n\r\nThe wallet is not just change addresses, and there is more than one address in a wallet that you use to receive Bitcoin with. Most modern wallets (including Bitcoin Core) will generate a new address for every time you want to receive Bitcoin. It will also generate new change addresses whenever a change address is required. All a wallet is is a collection of private keys, and your Bitcoin can be associated with any of the private keys in a wallet. So once you import a private key into a wallet, that wallet as a whole contains your Bitcoin, not just the singular private key you imported.\r\n\r\n> A unix-an want to learn that quickly, during his user experience.\r\n\r\nAll of this information is documented on multiple websites. Bitcoin.org is a good resource for this type of stuff. There really is no need for any unix documentation, especially since the vast majority of users are not using any form of unix.\r\n\r\n> The app should log visibly everything that's happening, I think. When you grep or curl or whatever, you get to see everything right? :)\r\n\r\nMost of the things you are asking for are logged in the debug.log file. There is no need to print that out to the console as it is kind of useless and will add extra information that may confuse the user. It will especially make it more difficult to understand what is just logging output and what is the actual result of the command.",

          "body": "Currently the GUI wallet provided by Core is awkward to use:\r\nThere's no backup warning, so the user is often confused. Change-screwups like #11827 could happen over and over again. Offline/multisig transactions are also difficult/impossible (since Core uses hardened HD path, which made xpub useless). Sending/receiving address list panels are confusing (#15230).\r\n\r\nWhat the wallet should look like in my humble opinion:\r\nThe address list panel should contain known recipients only.\r\nThe receiving address list panel might be merged with the coin selection panel, which has a clear hierarchy tree view, thus HD-derived addresses and imported single privkeys would have clear distinction. Different script types could also be elegantly handled. The user would also benefit from clear backup warnings, change-screwup would become history. It would be even better if PSBT and xpub importing could be supported, so that multisig/offline transactions would be easy.",

          "body": "This is a brainstorming issue on the GUI. If I am missing context of past discussions on this please direct me to links (That is certainly possible, there have been years of discussions I am not aware of). I am opening this because I value my time and other contributors' time rather than because I am a regular user of the GUI (Disclaimer: I'm not but I have started reviewing some GUI related PRs and am interested in continuing to do so.)\r\n\r\nI am not a trained UX/UI designer but there appears to be some basic design principles when it comes to designing the GUI and providing feedback on GUI PRs that are being ignored on this project. Ideally we'll get some trained designers to start contributing to the project who can carry out basic feedback exercises to ensure GUI changes are informed and not subject to biases, bikeshedding etc\r\n\r\n1) Who are we designing the GUI for? Long term Core contributors (highly technical) that use the GUI on a regular basis? I don't know how many of these there are. Technically curious who use the GUI when they can't work out how to do something from the command line? Complete Bitcoin beginners? All of these groups? If it is the latter then we should all be under no illusions that compromises are necessary which will mean it is impossible for the design to be optimal for an individual group.\r\n\r\n2) Design preferences are subject to the \"sample size of 1\" trap where those reviewing GUI changes think they are providing feedback on behalf of a group that they don't belong to. A highly technical user just does not know what is optimal for a beginner. The only way you see what is optimal for a beginner is putting alternative GUIs in the hands of a statistically significant group of beginners. \r\n\r\nAn example open PR that motivated this issue is #16966. This is not picking on any of the people involved in that PR. When the project was smaller with fewer contributors there was no alternative other than individuals discussing their personal preferences. But at some stage (and certainly if we want the GUI to be used by greater numbers of users) we need a more effective collective thought process on this.\r\n\r\nI've reached out to some designers in the Bitcoin community and hopefully some of them will get involved in this discussion and/or review of future GUI PRs.\r\n",
