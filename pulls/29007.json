    "body": "Testing addrman functionality is limited in the functional tests because `nKey` for the addrman is chosen randomly during every run and there's a small chance for collision when inserting a new address into the addrman. Currently in our tests, we keep only 1 address in the new table, 1 address in the tried table and don't insert new addresses into the addrman because of these possible collisions. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26988#discussion_r1091145647, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23084, [#22831(comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22831/files#r708302639). \r\n\r\nImprove address manager testing we can do with our functional tests by using a deterministic addrman.\r\n\r\n### reason for collisions when inserting an address into new table\r\n- the new table in the addrman has 1024 buckets and each bucket has 64 positions.\r\n- when a new address is added using `addpeeraddress` RPC,\r\n\t- the bucket where this address is placed is calculated from `nKey`, netgroup of ip address, netgroup of source address\r\n\t- the bucket position where this address is placed is calculated from `nKey`, bucket number, ip address and port information\r\n- if 2 addresses belong to same netgroup, they would both be assigned the same new table bucket.\r\n- since the bucket position where this address is placed is calculated from hashing information containing `nKey`, bucket number, ip address and port information; and then doing %64. it's possible that the position calculated would collide for certain `nKey`, ip address and port combo since `nKey` is generated randomly every run. and the address doesn't get added into the new table\r\n\r\n### reason for collisions when inserting an address into tried table\r\n- the tried table in the addrman has 256 buckets and each bucket has 64 positions.\r\n- when an address is added using `addpeeraddress` RPC,\r\n\t- the bucket where this address is placed is calculated from `nKey`, ip address and port information and netgroup of ip address\r\n\t- the bucket position where this address is placed is calculated from `nKey`, bucket number, ip address and port information (like in new table)\r\n- if 2 addresses belong to same netgroup, there's a lesser chance(compared to the new table) that they get asssigned the same tried table bucket because ip address and port info is also used in calculating the bucket.\r\n- assuming they get placed in same bucket, it's possible the bucket position could collide here too. (same reasoning as for new table address collision)",

          "body": "When trying to add an address to the IP address manager tried table, it's first added to the new table and then moved to the tried table. Previously, adding a conflicting address to the address manager's tried table with test-only `addpeeraddress tried=true` RPC would return `{ \"success\": true }`. However, the address would not be added to the tried table, but would remain in the new table. This caused, e.g., issue #28964.\r\n\r\nThis is fixed by new returning `{ \"success\":  false, \"error\": \"...\" }` for failed tried table additions. Since the address remaining in the new table can't be removed (the address manager interface does not support removing addresses at the moment and adding this seems to be a bigger effort), an error message is returned. This indicates to a user why the RPC failed and allows accounting for the extra address in the new table. This is done in the functional test for the `getrawaddrman` RPC.\r\n\r\nFixes #28964 ",
