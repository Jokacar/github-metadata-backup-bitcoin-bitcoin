          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [ ] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick)\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts. Is this a problem?",

          "body": "The `Socks5()` function which does the SOCKS5 handshake with the SOCKS5 proxy sends bytes to the socket without retrying partial writes.\r\n\r\n`send(2)` may write only part of the provided data and return. In this case the caller is responsible for retrying the operation with the remaining data. Change `Socks5()` to do that. There is already a method `Sock::SendComplete()` which does exactly that, so use it in `Socks5()`.\r\n\r\nA minor complication for this PR is that `Sock::SendComplete()` takes `std::string` argument whereas `Socks5()` has `std::vector<uint8_t>`. Thus the necessity for the first commit. It is possible to do also in other ways - convert the data in `Socks5()` to `std::string` or have just one `Sock::SendComplete()` that takes `void*` and change the callers to pass `str.data(), str.size()` or `vec.data(), vec.size()`.\r\n\r\nThis came up while testing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27375.",

          "body": "This PR is a follow-up to fix review comments and a bugfix from #28385\r\n\r\nThe PR\r\n\r\n- Updated `DisconnectedBlockTransactions`'s `MAX_DISCONNECTED_TX_POOL` from kb to bytes.\r\n- Moved `DisconnectedBlockTransactions` implementation code to `kernel/disconnected_transactions.cpp`.\r\n- `AddTransactionsFromBlock` now assume duplicate transactions are not passed by asserting after inserting each transaction to `iters_by_txid`.\r\n- Included a Bug fix: In the current master we are underestimating the memory usage of `DisconnectedBlockTransactions`.\r\n\r\n    * When adding and subtracting `cachedInnerUsage` we call `RecursiveDynamicUsage` with `CTransaction` which invokes this [`RecursiveDynamicUsage(const CTransaction& tx)`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6e721c923c87abdb8d99674093d08d8c17bc52c2/src/core_memusage.h#L32) version of `RecursiveDynamicUsage`, the output of that call only account for the memory usage of the inputs and outputs of the `CTransaction`, this omits the memory usage of the `CTransaction` object and the control block.\r\n    * This PR fixes this bug by calling `RecursiveDynamicUsage` with `CTransactionRef` when adding and subtracting `cachedInnerUsage` which invokes [`RecursiveDynamicUsage(const std::shared_ptr<X>& p)`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6e721c923c87abdb8d99674093d08d8c17bc52c2/src/core_memusage.h#L67) version of `RecursiveDynamicUsage` the output of the calculation accounts for the` CTransaction` object, the control blocks, inputs and outputs memory usage. \r\n    * see  [comment ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28385#discussion_r1322948452)\r\n- Added test for DisconnectedBlockTransactions memory limit.",

          "body": "This is a (rough draft) clean rewrite of BIP300 (Drivechain) consensus-level code.\r\n\r\nInstead of a separate sidechain database (which may be prone to hard-to-review/test consistency issues), instead the unusable 8 MSB of the UTXO index are reserved for non-UTXO database entries, and the existing UTXO db and caching layer is shared. This can be refactored in the future, but I think it is the cleanest and most reviewable approach initially - open to other ideas, though. There's also some ugliness in the undo data to handle restoring the new data, but it's abstracted and shouldn't be too hard to reason about.\r\n\r\nUsing these new primitives, Drivechains can be reimplemented with a UTXO-like model. Note that there is zero activation logic in the current PR: the protocol changes are *always* active. Therefore, this will *not* work (at least not safely) on Bitcoin today, and cannot be deployed without significant additional changes to handle an activation.\r\n\r\nA new `SERIALIZE_TRANSACTION_FOR_WEIGHT` serialization flag is also added, that is meant only for weight counting. This allows for adjusting weight (upward) to fit additional resource requirements by new functionality. In this case, several Drivechain \"messages\" are expected to have a larger burden than their `OP_RETURN` encoding would otherwise weigh. However, the specific adjustments are not implemented in this draft.\r\n\r\nAs a consensus change, this can only be implemented with community support. Many people seem to have opinions, but please keep them to other forums. Despite providing and continuing this implementation, I myself do not thereby endorse or otherwise comment on the proposal itself.\r\n\r\nTherefore, not looking for concept ACKs/NACKs (ie, about Drivechains), just *Approach* ACKs / constructive criticism (ie, about *how* I'm implementing it).",

          "title": "wallet: add `seeds` argument to `importdescriptors`",
          "body": "This PR introduces the ability to import BIP32 master seeds alongside xpubs. It currently expects seeds to be provided in [BIP 93/codex32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0093.mediawiki) either as a single seed or as a list of shares which can be assembled via Shamir Secret Sharing.\r\n\r\nIt could be generalized to other seed formats, e.g. a hex-encoding or the old `sethdseeds` WIF format, easily enough by just attempting to parse the input in those formats and retrying until we find one that works. (Though we must be extremely careful that these formats are unambiguous! If the user imports a seed they don't expect, which fails to match the one they've backed up, the result could be coin loss. For formats with no prefix or checksum, e.g. hex-encoded bytes, we may need to require the user provide a prefix or a separate flag.)\r\n\r\nThe motivation here is that users who are importing their coins from another wallet likely have them in the form of a public descriptor (probably one of the standard `pkh(BIP44/48/84/whatever)` ones) along with a master seed (probably in some seed word format, but this is easy enough to convert to a straight BIP32 seed with an external tool). The seed, presumably, they want to minimize handling of, while the descriptor they are likely to be copy/pasting from somewhere and generally being less careful with.\r\n\r\nTo import this into Core, they currently need to construct a version of their descriptor in which xpubs are replaced by xprivs, and import that. This is cumbersome and potentially dangerous. With this extra RPC flag they are able to separately tweak their descriptor however they need, and then adding their seed data, unmodified, at the last minute in one place.\r\n\r\nMy specific use case is: I have an estate planning document which contains careful instructions for reconstructing seed data from shares which are stored separately and externally to the planning document. Meanwhile, the document itself contains a public descriptor, with checksum already computed, which is stored in several locations accessible by an open-ended set of people. If I were forced to mix the secret data with the public data, it would increase the risk of leaking the secrets as well as the risk of losing the public part.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Other approaches, that I considered but chose not to take:\r\n\r\n* Extend the existing `sethdseed` RPC. This RPC is legacy-only and not supported by descriptor wallets, because it depends on the legacy \"bag of keys\" model where you could stick keys into the wallet and it'd \"just work\", often in surprising ways.\r\n* Add a new descriptor-wallet-based `importseed` RPC or something. This doesn't work for more-or-less the same reason; the descriptor wallet associates all its keys with `ScriptPubKeyManager`s, so we would need to add support for \"global keys\" somehow. This is a lot of work, lots of room for bikeshedding, and I worry that @achow101 will NACK anything that looks too much like a \"bag of keys\" model. (The situation would be much less bad than the legacy one, where 3rd parties could do stuff like mapping p2wpkh addresses to p2pkh ones and the wallet would just accept it ... but it would still potentially lead to user confusion about what exact conditions the wallet could sign for what descriptors, and it may constrain future wallet changes.)\r\n* Adding a `codex32(...)/1/2/3` xpriv format to the descriptor import format. This was suggested to me by @sipa and has the benefit that very closely matches the existing import model.\r\n\r\nPersonally I don't like the latter\r\n* for the reasons stated in the PR description -- I like my descriptors to be public, and my secret data to be limited to 16 bytes, and I think this is a common mode of operation for people coming from other wallets\r\n* ...and maybe worse, a common model for other wallet authors, who would refuse to nicely interoperate with this);\r\n* because it felt like enough of a change to deserve a change to one of the descriptor BIPs, but those are big enough already and it's hard to get tiny changes to propagate to all implementors of standards. Plus it felt wrong to couple codex32 with descriptors like this.i\r\n* because if you have multiple descirptors that use the same seed, it would force you to copy the seed multiple times, which is dangerous. (In some cases [BIP 389](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1354) will make this better, but it doesn't cover everything and anyway is not accepted or implemented yet. One thing at a time :))\r\n\r\nBut what cinched it, and made me switch to the approach in the PR, was that @roconnor-blockstream pointed out to me that the codex32 model means that you can't predict, at writing-down-the-descriptor time, exactly what shares you'll be inputting. And because descriptors have a checksum which covers their entire string encoding, this means that you can't predict ahead-of-timei what will go into the `codex32(...)` slot and therefore what the total checksum ought to be. And this means that either (a) you lose the descriptor checksum, which is a Bad Idea and also inconvenient for importers who' will have to construct a checksum with `getdescriptorinfo` to get `importdescriptors` to accept it, even though said checksum had never been used to protect data in storage; or (b) you modify the descriptor checksum algorithm to be aware of `codex(...)` and to skip checksumming the data inside of that. This means even more implementation complexity that other wallets are unlikely to bring in, plus the result generalizes less easily to other seed formats (e.g. hex) which don't have checksums of their own.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "This contains everything to make mempool/validation logic ready for package relay (see #27463).\r\n\r\nDesign goals:\r\n- Be able to gracefully deal with any arbitrary list of transactions (these come from p2p)\r\n- Validate any ancestor package so that the incentive-compatible transactions end up in our mempool.\r\n  - If the transactions would be accepted individually, they should also be accepted through `AcceptPackage`. We don't want to accidentally reject things just because we happened to download them as a package.\r\n  - Bug prior to these changes: we required `IsChildWithParents` but if there were dependencies between the parents, we could end up (1) accepting a low-feerate child or (2) rejecting a high-feerate parent CPFPing another parent. See the \"interdependent parents\" test case for a specific example.\r\n- Be DoS-resistant.\r\n   - Avoid quadratic validation costs.\r\n   - Avoid loading a lot of stuff from disk, or loading repeatedly.\r\n\r\nA description of the package validation logic (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26711#issuecomment-1647523520):\r\n\r\n- Basic sanitization. Quit if it's too big, inconsistent, etc.\r\n- Linearize (Topological sort only)\r\n- **PreChecks loop** For each tx, grab UTXOs to calculate fees and filter out anything we should skip:\r\n    - If already in mempool (or same txid in mempool), mark as skip\r\n    - If missing inputs or conflict, record this failure and mark this and all descendants as skip.\r\n    - If no failures or TX_SINGLE_FAILURE, continue\r\n    - For some failures that we expect due to differing chainstates, skip these transactions and their descendants, but continue.\r\n    - Otherwise, record this failure and mark that we will `quit_early` (i.e. not do the Subpackage validation loop).\r\n- Refine our linearization using the fee information.\r\n- **Subpackage validation loop** For each transaction in the new linearized order:\r\n    - Get the transaction's ancestor subpackage.\r\n    - If the feerate of this transaction is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - If the feerate of this subpackage is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - Otherwise, try to submit the subpackage, using `AcceptSingleTransaction()` if it's just 1 tx\r\n    - if at any point we get a non-fee-related error, abort all.\r\n- Call `LimitMempoolSize`\r\n- Backfill results:\r\n    - If the transaction was in mempool, check to see if it's still there in case it was trimmed in `LimitMempoolSize`.\r\n    - Try to use results from the subpackage validation loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early), use results from prechecks loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early and we hadn't found a failure with it yet), fill with `TX_UNKNOWN`.\r\n\r\nThis means we will call `PreChecks` for each transaction 2 times (fewer if we quit early), and run all other validation checks at most 1 time. A transaction shouldn't be validated in the subpackage validation loop more than once.",

          "body": "Add `util::Result` support for returning more error information and make use of it in [LoadChainstate method](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665/commits/60d8893608deb113b44446cdc2c35107a5b3eb3f) as an initial application. Followup PR [#25722](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25722) uses it more broadly to return errors and warnings from wallet loading functions as well.\r\n\r\nThis change adds two major features to the result class:\r\n\r\n- For better error handling, adds the ability to return a value on failure, not just a value on success. This is a key missing feature that makes the result class not useful for functions like `LoadChainstate()` which produce different errors that need to be handled differently [^1].\r\n\r\n[^1]: Ability to return error values was actually present in the original implementation of [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218), but unfortunately removed in later iterations.\r\n\r\n- For better error reporting, adds the ability to return warning messages and multiple errors, not just a single error string. This provides a way for functions to report errors and warnings in a standard way, and simplifies interfaces:\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -virtual std::unique_ptr<Wallet> loadWallet(const std::string& name, bilingual_str& error, std::vector<bilingual_str>& warnings) = 0;\r\n    +virtual util::Result<std::unique_ptr<Wallet>> loadWallet(const std::string& name) = 0;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options, DatabaseStatus& status, bilingual_str& error);\r\n    +util::Result<std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase>, DatabaseError> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options);\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThis change also makes some more minor improvements:\r\n\r\n- Smaller type size. `util::Result<int>` is 16 bytes, and `util::Result<void>` is 8 bytes. Previously both were 72 bytes.\r\n\r\n- Broader type compatibility. Supports noncopyable and nonmovable success and error types.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives & design notes\r\n\r\nThe main goal for the `util::Result` class is to provide a standard way for functions to report error and warnings strings. The interface tries to make it easy to provide detailed error feedback to end users, without cluttering code or making it harder to return other result information. There have been multiple iterations of the design using different internal representations and providing different capabilities:\r\n\r\n|   | Representation (approximate)                   | Notes |\r\n|---|------------------------------------------------|-------|\r\n| _(1)_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Original #25218 implementation in da98fd2efc1a6b9c6e876cf3e227a8c2e9a10827. Good capabilities, but larger type size. Supports error standardized error reporting and customized error handling with failure values. |\r\n| _(2)_ | `variant<T,bilingual_str>`                | Final #25218 implementation in 7a45c33d1f8a758850cf8e7bd6ad508939ba5c0d. No support for returning failure values so not useful in many cases.\r\n| _(3)_ | `variant<monostate,T,F>`                 | Pending #25601 implementation that allows choosing whether to use standardized error reporting or return custom failure values, but doesn't support having both at the same time, like approaches _(1)_, _(4)_, _(5)_, _(6)_ do. |\r\n | _(4)_ | `tuple<variant<T,F>,bilingual_str>`      | Original #25608 implementation in c29d3008de9314dd463ed08e8bff39fe55324498. Basically the same as _(1)_ except it uses separate success and failure types instead of the same type. Using separate success and failure types makes the result class a little less flexible but can help avoid some ambiguity and inconsistent result states. |\r\n| _(5)_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Final #25608 implementation in dd91f294206ac87b213d23bb76656a0a5f0f4781. Essentially the same as original implementation _(1)_ except has some usability improvements. |\r\n| _(6)_ | `tuple<T,unique_ptr<tuple<F,bilingual_str>>` | Pending #25665 implementation (this PR). Supports returning failure values, uses separate success and failure types to avoid ambiguity, uses `unique_ptr` to reduce result type size, and avoids heap allocation in the happy path. |\r\n\r\n### Prior discussions & history\r\n\r\n- _furszy_ introduced a `BResult` class providing a standard error reporting mechanism in [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218). It was renamed to `util::Result` in [#25721](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25721) but kept the same representation and capabilities.\r\n\r\n- _MarcoFalke_ suggested using `BResult` for the `LoadChainstate` function in [#25308 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25308#issuecomment-1181674645). Inability to use `BResult` there due to lack of support for failure values led to initial work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _w0xlt_ wrote a `StructuredResult` class in [#25308](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25601) adding the ability to return failure values but sacrificing standard error reporting, which led to more work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _martinus_ suggested a space optimization in [#25608 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608#discussion_r921049409) that also made it easier to support distinct failure & success types, leading to [#25665](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665) as a replacement for [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).",

          "title": "descriptors: Be able to specify change and receiving in a single descriptor string",
          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",
