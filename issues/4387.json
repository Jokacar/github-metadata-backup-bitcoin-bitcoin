    "title": "nodes rely on other nodes to send a block inv before sending getblocks",
    "body": "This assumption will fail if modified clients don't send the block inv after the last block being sent.\n\nIt is possible that a modified client may want to send only a limited number of blocks and not have the requesting node send more requests. In this case, the modified node will not send the inv of the next block to prompt the requesting node to send a further getblocks.\n\nA solution to this is to make nodes able to detect when the sending node has stopped sending blocks (e.g. a block isn't being sent immediately after the last block was received). In this case, it can determine that the SyncNode is no longer a SyncNode and re-select a SyncNode to which to send the next getblocks.\n",

          "body": "This has taken me several days to code and test, and I've tested it thoroughly.\n\nWith the current code, that uses only one syncnode, with these changes, the node will never download orphan blocks. With net debugging enabled, you will get a good view of what it's doing.\n\nIt also downloads the blockchain very fast, and never allows more than 60 seconds (the default) of inactivity to occur, so recovers very quickly from stuck downloads. With my testing, this can safely be reduced to 10 seconds as if a downloads sticks for as long as 10 seconds, it never recovers, so rather than wait two minutes as the current code does (well, tries to do), it quickly switches to a new syncnode.\n\nPlease do test, and give comments. So far, with the orphan problem, many people are unable to run the node without limiting orphan blocks (which still doesn't fix the stuck download anyway).\n\nFeel free to copy this branch and improve it. I've included quite a few commits to make it easier to see the development process, but I won't always have time to make the changes needed that people ask for, and from experience my pull requests often don't get pulled for some reason. I think this functionality is needed now based upon the issues people have been raising.\n",
