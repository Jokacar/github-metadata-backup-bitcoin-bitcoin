    "body": "Broken out from #28122 \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBech32(m) was defined with a 90 character limit so that certain guarantees for error detection could be made for segwit addresses (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki#checksum-design). \r\n\r\nHowever, there is nothing about the encoding scheme itself that requires a limit of 90 and in practice bech32(m) is being used without the 90 char limit (e.g. lightning invoices, silent payments). Further, increasing the character limit doesn't do away with error detection, it simply changes the guarantee.\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation for this change is for being able to parse BIP352 v0 silent payment addresses (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122/commits/622c7a98b9f08177a3cfb601306daabb101af1fd), which require up to 118 characters. In addition to BIP352, modeling the character limit as an enum allows us to easily support new address types that use bech32m and specify their own character limit.\r\n\r\n",

The project is tracked in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28536\r\n\r\nBased on https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1519\r\n\r\n## Pre-work / Refactors\r\n\r\nThe first three commits are pre-work / refactors needed for this PR. They are broken out into the following PRS:\r\n\r\n* #30046 \r\n* #30047 \r\n* #30048\r\n\r\n## BIP352\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses strictly on the BIP logic and attempts to separate it from the wallet and transaction implementation details. This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing. Labels for the receiver are optional and thus deferred for a later PR.\r\n\r\nTest vectors from the BIP are included as unit tests.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing, it is strongly recommended you read https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458 and take a look at the reference python implementation on the BIP.\r\n",

          "body": "### **Issue:**\r\n\r\nSimply `DecodeDestination` does not handle errors where the user inputs a valid address for the wrong network. _e.x. testnet while running client on mainnet_  \r\n\r\nThe current error `not a valid Bech32 or Base58 encoding` for a valid address on a different network is entirely incorrect. This is because of the is_bech32 variable used at the core of `DecodeDestination` logic  only checks that the prefix matches. If it doesn't it just starts running everything as `DecodeBase58Check` regardless if the Bech32 String was actually valid.\r\n\r\n### **Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nBase58 Addresses with invalid prefixes will now display network and expected values.\r\n\r\n- previous: `Invalid or unsupported Base58-encoded address.`\r\n- 27260 `Invalid or unsupported Base58 testnet address. Expected prefix m, n, or 2`\r\n\r\nBech32 Addresses with invalid prefixes will now display network and expected values. The current from of the error is completely incorrect when the user passes valid Bech32 for the wrong network.\r\n\r\n- previous: `Invalid or unsupported Segwit (Bech32) or Base58 encoding.`\r\n- 27260: `Invalid chain prefix for testnet. Expected tb got bc`\r\n\r\n### **Reference**\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26290\r\n### **Implementation :**\r\nSimply put, don't delay the attempt to decode the string as Bech32 using Bech32::Decode(str). This takes a minimal amount CPU cycles to perform and is acceptable to do since this operation is not performed often. \r\n\r\nOnce you get the decoding status of the string as bech32, do the same with DecodeBase58 using a len of 100 and DecodeBase58Check. This gives you enough information to start properly decoding errors. \r\n\r\nAfter you have decoded the address in various formats run though the logic and display errors for invalid addresses with the network names and expected values when the user just misses the prefix.\r\n\r\n**Update 1**: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27260#issuecomment-1628375439\r\n\r\n### **Other Notes**\r\n\r\n- Previous errors had inconsistencies such as random periods in some errors and not others. Using the word encoded in some errors and not others. This has been resolved.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.

Got any other ideas? :)\r\n\r\nYeah, I was getting an icky feeling while updating the PR for 2 reasons: `NO_LIMIT` of 0 is crappy and also the caller needs to make sure to use the same `CharLimit` for `Decode` and again with `LocateErrors`, which seems foot-gunny.\r\n\r\nMy ideal solution is `Decode`/`LocateErrors` shouldn't have a character limit at all (or use 1024, considering BIP173 mentions that bech32 error detection works reasonably well up to 1024 characters). Then, character limits for specific address types (e.g. bc1, sp1) should be enforced in the Destination Encoder/Decoder in [src/key_io.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/key_io.cpp).\r\n\r\nIIRC, when I first wrote this code a year ago, there wasn't much appetite for moving the charlimit out of `Decode`. If thats still the case, my next best solution would be keep the Enum and remove the `NO_LIMIT` case.",
