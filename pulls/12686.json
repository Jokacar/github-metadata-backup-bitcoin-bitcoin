Turns out there's more than I expected: this is going to make maintenance of the GUI code, as well as adding new features significantly easier.\r\n\r\n(I know there's still some references left to qt4 in RPM and Debian build script, but I don't have the knowledge how to fix them)",

It matches any single character that sorts between the two characters, inclusive, using the locale's collating sequence and character set. For example, in the default C locale, `[a-d]` is equivalent to `[abcd]`. Many  locales sort characters in dictionary order, and in these locales `[a-d]` is typically not equivalent to `[abcd]`; it might be equivalent to `[aBbCcDd]`, for example. To obtain the traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the C locale by setting the `LC_ALL` environment variable to the value C.\r\n\r\nContext: [Locale issue found when reviewing #13450](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13450/files#r194877736)\r\n",

          "title": "[WIP] support new multisig template in wallet for Solver, signing, and signature combining",
          "body": "…ature combining\r\n\r\nCurrently the wallet can only sign/understand up to n-of-16 checkmultisig templates. Some efforts are being taken to expand this to n-of-20: #13348 . Rather than try to increase the number of possible signatures marginally this template is based on https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/51653 which allows signing/combining of up to n-of-67, constrained by the non-push opcode limit.\r\n\r\n```\r\n+/* Script of the form:\r\n+ *\r\n+ * <pubkey1> OP_CHECKSIG\r\n+ * OP_SWAP <pubkey2> OP_CHECKSIG OP_ADD\r\n+ * OP_SWAP <pubkey3> OP_CHECKSIG OP_ADD\r\n+ * ...\r\n+ * OP_SWAP <pubkey67> OP_CHECKSIG OP_ADD\r\n+ * <m> OP_NUMEQUAL\r\n+ */\r\n```\r\n\r\nWallet code currently disallows import of any redeem/witnessscript beyond 520 bytes(n-of-15), so no safety is lost due to the possible mixture of segwit/non-segwit scripts.\r\n\r\nLooking for concept ACKs before I go write tests and attempt code de-duplication, but manual testing worked.",
