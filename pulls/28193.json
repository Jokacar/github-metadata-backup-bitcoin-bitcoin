    "body": "This PR adds unit test coverage for the script compression functions `{Compress,Decompress}Script` in the special case of uncompressed P2PK outputs (scriptPubKey: OP_PUSH65 <0x04 ....> OP_CHECKSIG) with [pubkeys that are not fully valid](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/44b05bf3fef2468783dcebf651654fdd30717e7e/src/pubkey.cpp#L297-L302), i.e. where the encoded point is not on the secp256k1 curve. For those outputs, script compression is not possible, as the y coordinate of the pubkey can't be recovered (see also call-site of `IsToPubKey`):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/44b05bf3fef2468783dcebf651654fdd30717e7e/src/compressor.cpp#L49-L50\r\n\r\nLikewise, for a compressed script of an uncompressed P2PK script (i.e. compression ids 4 and 5) where the x coordinate is not on the curve, decompression fails:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/44b05bf3fef2468783dcebf651654fdd30717e7e/src/compressor.cpp#L122-L129\r\n\r\nNote that the term \"compression\" is used here in two different meanings (though they are related), which might be a little confusing. The encoding of a pubkey can either be compressed (33-bytes with 0x02/0x03 prefixes) or uncompressed (65-bytes with 0x04 prefix). On the other hand there is also compression for whole output scripts, which is used for storing scriptPubKeys in the UTXO set in a compact way (and also for the `dumptxoutset` result, accordingly). P2PK output scripts with uncompressed pubkeys get compressed by storing only the x-coordinate and the sign as a prefix (0x04 = even, 0x05 = odd). Was diving deeper into the subject while working on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27432, where the script decompression of uncompressed P2PK needed special handling (see also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24628#issuecomment-1108798536).\r\n\r\nTrivia: as of now (block 801066), there are 13 uncompressed P2PK outputs in the UTXO set with a pubkey not on the curve (which obviously means they are unspendable).",

This results in some things that would have given an address for P2PK scripts to no longer do so. This is arguably more correct.\r\n\r\n`ExtractDestination`'s behavior is slightly changed for the above. It now returns `true` for those destinations that have addresses, so P2PK scripts now result in `false`. Even though it returns false for `CNoDestination`, the script will now be included in that `CNoDestination`.\r\n\r\nBuilds on #28244",

          "body": "Some future work needs to touch things in script/standard.{h/cpp}, however it is unclear if it is safe to do so as they are included in several different places that could effect standardness and consensus. It contains a mix of policy parameters, consensus parameters, and utilities only used by the wallet. This PR breaks up the various components and renames the files to clearly separate everything.\r\n\r\n* `CTxDestination` is moved to a new file `src/addresstype.{cpp/h}`\r\n* `TaprootSpendData` and `TaprootBuilder` (and their utility functions and structs) are moved to `SigningProvider` as these are used only during signing.\r\n* `CScriptID` is moved to `script/script.h` to be next to `CScript`.\r\n* `MANDATORY_SCRIPT_VERIFY_FLAGS` is moved to `interpreter.h`\r\n* The parameters `DEFAULT_ACCEPT_DATACARRIER` and `MAX_OP_RETURN_RELAY` are moved to `policy.h`\r\n* `standard.{cpp/h}` is renamed to `solver.{cpp/h}` since that's all that's left in the file after the above moves",

The project is tracked in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28536\r\n\r\n## BIP352\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses strictly on the BIP logic and attempts to separate it from the wallet and transaction implementation details. This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing. Labels for the receiver are optional and thus deferred for a later PR.\r\n\r\nTest vectors from the BIP are included as unit tests.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing, it is strongly recommended you read https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458 and take a look at the reference python implementation on the BIP.\r\n",
