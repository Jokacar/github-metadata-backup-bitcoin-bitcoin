          "body": "Firstly, this does not change any consensus parameters or deviate from current behavior.\n\nInstead, hard-coded values are moved to chainparams so that all chains can specify values independently. Further, some values are handled by an interface class so that they may be dynamic based on block time. Each chain is free to implement MaxBlockSize/MaxTxSize/MaxBlockSigops as they wish. This helps to facilitate testing without interrupting mainnet/testnet.\n\nFor initial testing, I've added a secondary regtest chain with a dynamic blocksize: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/blob/blocksize-consensus/src/chainparams.cpp#L90\n\nIt's very simple, but it allows for experimentation. There's also a test that steps through a few size increases.\n\nMy only concern is with the storage of transactions in the wallet: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/3872ccf3beff24204ff293db0e81ceb5c7740455#diff-e506682270036e4c8e0b8159a34b652d. We may want to be smarter about considering wallet transactions as valid by differentiating between those known to be in a block and those that aren't. @jonasschnelli any opinion?\n\nThis should not be considered as change to allow for bigger blocks (several pieces are missing in that regard, including p2p changes and blockfile handling), but rather as a logical move of the parameters to a place that makes more sense for them.\n",

It also cherry picks one commit from #6526 (modified to rename CheckTransaction to Consensus::CheckTx [again, that rename is diff-wise free]).\n\nThe function definitions are left in main.cpp for now, but some of them will have to be moved to consensus/consensus.cpp before exposing anything else in libconsensus (my preference would be to expose VerifyHeader next, but I haven't got much feedback in that reward).\n\nBlocked by:\n- [ ] Blocksize: Turn MAX_BLOCK_SIZE and MAX_BLOCK_SIGOPS into functions #6625\n",

          "body": "This replaces/includes #6625 (previously #6526), #6009, #6051 and #6591 (previously #6024).\n\nEDIT (further explanation demanded):\n\nAlthough the PRs linked from here can provide a better explanation of the motivation, it is not so convenient for reviewers since they have to go through them individually.\n\nThe first 4 commits are taken from #6625, which is a modification of #6526 that doesn't break some other things. The modifications are explained in #6625. Although the #6526 has an extensive description, I will summarize its general purpose here.\nThe goal is to prepare the consensus code for an eventual block size hardfork and also for previous testing. It should simplify other PRs like #6382 (that introduces `std::numeric_limits<uint64_t>::max()` testnet chains to test different block sizes), #6451 (BIP102) or any other block-size-related proposal.\n\nThe next commit is taken from #6009, which separates GetMedianTimePast() from CBlockIndex and moves it to consensus (it's done in the same commit instead of the next one because it's \"cheaper diff-wise\"). GetMedianTimePast() is needed for verifying block headers, but chain.o will not.\n\nThe next commit is the code movement. All consensus critical functions that are not separated already (like 4 of the 5 functions in pow.o [the other one can be separated out]) in build-separable files are moved. If you think any of the moved functions are not consensus critical or that there's some missing functions, please, say so. One exception is main::ConnectBlock() which is consensus critical but contains other things that are not welcomed in libconsensus. A VerifyBlock library-safe function can be extracted from it later. #6051 was a similar movement.\n\nThe last commit is taken from  #6591 (previously #6024). This one has 2 purposes:\n\n1) Remove chainparams.h and timedata.h dependencies (which are not library-friendly) from consensus.o \n2) It's part of a bigger process (see #5970 ) to eventually be able to remove the pCurrentParams global (hidden behind `Params()`, but still a global). I hope I don't need to explain here why removing globals is a desirable thing...\n",

I have marked a number of TODO comments in the source code of this pull request. The changes listed here are not critical to the project but they are good introductory material. Each TODO is relatively simple, and more experienced developers are busy doing other tasks, making this an excellent chance for you to get feedback from me on basic contributions to Bitcoin Core. Hopefully this will help you streamline submissions to Core, please let me know how I can help.\"\r\n\r\nWe can slowly turn the global pCurrentParams (hidden behind the function \"Params()\" for no good reason) into a CChainParams& parameter wherever is needed. This will take very long and I won't be done by one single person. I'm pretty convinced that everybody agrees with this in general, so it should be relatively easy to get your based-on-this-PR merged. But I'm here, just ask.\r\n\r\nYou may be interested in this PR because:\r\n\r\n1) You are a developer, but you're not familiar with git (or mercurial or similar), or you are intimidated about contributing to Bitcoin Core for whatever reason. I've done it. I'm trying to be here to show you you can too (without coma between 2 \"yous\", if that's allowed in enligsh).\r\n2) You are interested in my PROMISES*\r\n3) You just want to get one commit merged in github/bitcoin/bitcoin because you have an interview in the evening, I don't care if you help me.\r\n4) rustyrussell told me nobody would ever read the forth point in a numbered list.\r\n\r\nWhat would you have to do:\r\n\r\nSimple: force me to remove TODO lines from this PR, one function at a time if possible.\r\n\r\nPROMISES:\r\n\r\nIf you force me to replace any TODO line in this PR, and you're open for nits in your own PR, I promise:\r\n- I will review your PR and nack soon or nit until I can give a no-test-needed ACK (or an utACK [the former is better]).\r\n- Please ping me on this PR, or on your own for anything related to this.\r\n\r\nOnce a month (at least):\r\n- collect nits and solve them\r\n- I will incorporate open PRs that remove TODOs from this mission.\r\n- I will rebase anything that's needed if the maintainer can't do it from my base to my-next-month-base, every month\r\n- I will try to attract more review to your PR. \r\n- You will just need patience some times.\r\n\r\n@laanwj please, take this as an open issue that is going to last for long. Just with code [but, still, never to merge no matter how much I change it].\r\n\r\nContinues #6173 #6163 #6024 (closed) #5054 and friends.\r\n",
