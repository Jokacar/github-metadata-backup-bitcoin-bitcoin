    "body": "Follow up for #27264.\r\n\r\nIn order to make sure that our persistent outbound slots belong to different netgroups, distinct net groups of our peers are added to `setConnected`. We’d only open a persistent outbound connection to peers which have a different netgroup compared to those netgroups present in `setConnected`.\r\n\r\nCurrent `GetGroup()` logic assumes route-based diversification behaviour for tor/i2p/cjdns addresses (addresses are public key based and not route-based). Distinct netgroups possible (according to the current `GetGroup()` logic) for:\r\n1. tor => 030f, 031f, .. 03ff (16 possibilities)\r\n2. i2p => 040f, 041f, .. 04ff (16 possibilities)\r\n3. cjdns => 05fc0f, 05fc1f, ... 05fcff (16 possibilities)\r\n\r\n`setConnected` is used in `ThreadOpenConnections()` before making [outbound](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/84f4ac39fda7ffa5dc84e92d92dd1eeeb5e20f8c/src/net.cpp#L1846) and [anchor](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/84f4ac39fda7ffa5dc84e92d92dd1eeeb5e20f8c/src/net.cpp#L1805) connections to new peers so that they belong to distinct netgroups.\r\n\r\n**behaviour on master**\r\n\r\n- if we run a node only on tor/i2p/cjdns\r\n\t- we wouldn't be able to open more than 16 outbound connections(manual, block-relay-only anchor, outbound full relay, block-relay-only connections) because we run out of possible netgroups.\r\n\t- see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27264#issuecomment-1481322628\r\n\t- tested by changing `MAX_OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY_CONNECTIONS` to 17 with `onlynet=onion` and observed how node wouldn't make more than 16 outbound connections.\r\n\r\n**behaviour on PR**\r\n\r\n- netgroup diversity checks are skipped for tor/i2p/cjdns addresses. \r\n- we don't insert tor/i2p/cjdns address in `setConnected` and `GetGroup` doesn't get called on tor/i2p/cjdns(see #27369)\r\n",

This does not apply however for Tor, I2P and CJDNS where the address is \"random\" bytes. Actually, Tor, I2P and CJDNS addresses that have common prefix are _harder_ to obtain than ones that don't have a common prefix (the opposite compared to IP).\r\n\r\nCurrently `NetGroupManager::GetGroup()` is doing prefixing on Tor, I2P and CJDNS addresses and assumes same properties apply as for IP addresses. This magically \"works\" to some extent but has drawbacks. Some serious changes are needed to remove that assumption from the code.\r\n\r\nSee\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22563\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27264#issuecomment-1481322628\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\n* Don't do prefixing on Tor, I2P and CJDNS and don't assume proximity based on that.\r\n* Treat all addresses from Tor as one group (because it is very easy to obtain huge amount of them). Same for I2P and CJDNS.\r\n* Make sure addrman can still store enough addresses from those networks.\r\n* Make sure a single source from Tor, I2P and CJDNS cannot flood addrman with junk due to the previous point.\r\n",

Add an additional check inside `LimitOutboundByNetgroup()` to skip netgroup diversity checks for outbound connections belonging to pure Tor-only/I2P-only/CJDNS-only networks. Then use this as a gatekeeper before choosing diverse netgroup addresses to make outbound connections to.\r\n2. [increase the 4 bits to 5 bits in `GetGroup()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27374#issuecomment-1491308956)\r\n   - this seems to be the simplest option! but i'm unsure about how it will affect other areas in the codebase where `GetGroup()` is used.\r\n \r\ncurious to know what everyone thinks about option 2? (otherwise we can go with option 1 for now)",

As far as I can see, this logic should equally be applied to addrs from alt networks, so it might be better to leave `setConnected` unchanged as sdaftuar suggested?\r\n\r\n@lightlike Good observation, I missed this.  I think that bit of code that we're using in our `OpenNetworkConnection()` call is really trying to determine how many open connections we have, not how many distinct netgroups we're connected to?  So from that perspective, I believe that line of code is written incorrectly; if we are running only on Tor and we happen to have 8 peers from the same netgroup, then presumably we are sufficiently connected that any failures to connect should be recorded in addrman.\r\n\r\nSo I think the right change here is to modify that line to just sum the number of outbound connections (full-relay, block-relay, addr-fetch, manual, and feelers) and use that in place of `setConnected.size()`.\r\n\r\n> Does this PR trick the code to behave as if we are not connected to Tor (by not inserting into setConnected) even if we are connected? It looks to me that trying to solve the problem of \"cannot open many connections to Tor\" this would create another problem: \"too many connections to Tor\" - it would allow all 8 outbound to be to Tor and will not try to diversify to IPv4 (or other networks).\r\n\r\n@vasild While it's possible that we'd make all 8 of our outbound connections to Tor peers, I think this is an unlikely problem, because we limit the number of Tor connections to be a fraction of our addrman (I can't recall what that fraction is though, can someone remind us?).  I believe that an adversary looking to exploit this can really only do so for (eg) new nodes that have a relatively small addrman, by flooding such a node with onion addresses; but that attack is already available today (since we have 16 different onion netgroups, an adversary creating a zillion onion addresses to eclipse a victim will just have the ones that are in different netgroups be the ones that eclipse a peer, instead of ones in the same netgroup).\r\n\r\nSo I don't think that this PR makes that problem any worse, and we can wait until we have something like #27213 to solve this problem more generally.\r\n\r\n> I feel that we should lookup -onlynet or allow connections to Tor up to a limit to avoid \"too many connections to Tor\". \r\n\r\nI think this is unnecessary and would be counter to what we're trying to fix here.  If a node is running on both ipv4 and tor, I think we should still not require netgroup diversity across the tor peers, because such diversity is meaningless.  And as I explained above I don't think the implicit limiting of tor peers that might arise from this would be needed or desirable.\r\n\r\n> still curious to know opinions about increasing 4 bits to 5 bits in `GetGroup()`\r\n\r\nThis would double the number of addrman slots that can be used by Tor peers, right?  My off the cuff guess is that this would be undesirable, but I haven't gone back to figure out what fraction of the addrman this would be yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This creates the following problems where it is called:\r\n\r\n* `NetWhitelistPermissions::TryParse()`: otherwise `-whitelist=` fails to white list CJDNS addresses: when a CJDNS peer connects to us, it will be matched against IPv6 `fc...` subnet and the match will never succeed.\r\n\r\n* `BanMapFromJson()`: CJDNS bans are stored as just IPv6 addresses in `banlist.json`. Upon reading from disk they have to be converted back to CJDNS, otherwise, after restart, a ban entry like (`fc00::1`, IPv6) would not match a peer (`fc00::1`, CJDNS).\r\n    \r\n* `RPCConsole::unbanSelectedNode()`: in the GUI the ban entries go through `CSubNet::ToString()` and back via `LookupSubNet()`. Then it must match whatever is stored in `BanMan`, otherwise it is impossible to unban via the GUI.\r\n\r\nThese were uncovered by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26859.\r\n\r\nThus, flip the result of `LookupSubNet()` to CJDNS if the network base address starts with `fc` and `-cjdnsreachable` is set. Since subnetting/masking does not make sense for CJDNS (the address is \"random\" bytes, like Tor and I2P, there is no hierarchy) treat `fc.../mask` as an invalid `CSubNet`.\r\n\r\nTo achieve that, `MaybeFlipIPv6toCJDNS()` has to be moved from `net` to `netbase` and thus also `IsReachable()`. In the process of moving `IsReachable()`, `SetReachable()` and `vfLimited[]` encapsulate those in a class.",

The code has been living between `netaddress` and `netbase` and some compilation units include these large files when they only need a `Network` enum or related method.  Separating the code to a standalone unit in `node` improves code separation and helps with using only what is needed.\r\n\r\nI verified the `include` headers with https://cirrus-ci.com/task/6749578737745920 generated by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27385/commits/8f647a65d3484c7acd2d97f4b055c582d7734b6f while this was in draft and carefully narrowed them down to the most relevant ones.\r\n\r\nPossible todos for a follow-up: upgrade `Network` to an `enum class`, e.g. `NET_I2P` becomes `Network::I2P` and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27385/commits/5cfa3fb8b5815aaf96483a63526e5f0bf3c0a06b.",

      "body": "RE `fCountFailure` bool: \r\n@mzumsande  \r\n> to determine the fCountFailure bool, which tells addrman to possibly deprioritize selecting an address after various failed attempts (nAttempts). As far as I can see, this logic should equally be applied to addrs from alt networks, so it might be better to leave setConnected unchanged as sdaftuar suggested?\r\n\r\n@sdaftuar\r\n> I think that bit of code that we're using in our OpenNetworkConnection() call is really trying to determine how many open connections we have, not how many distinct netgroups we're connected to? So from that perspective, I believe that line of code is written incorrectly; if we are running only on Tor and we happen to have 8 peers from the same netgroup, then presumably we are sufficiently connected that any failures to connect should be recorded in addrman.\r\n> \r\n> So I think the right change here is to modify that line to just sum the number of outbound connections (full-relay, block-relay, addr-fetch, manual, and feelers) and use that in place of setConnected.size().\r\n\r\nlooks like this code was introduced in #8065, with the primary motivation stated as preventing inaccurate incrementing of the addrman counter when a node is offline. this reinforces what I suspected from reading the code, so the suggestion to update the logic to the sum of outbound connections makes sense\r\n\r\nhowever, the OP of that post also states: \r\n> This is still somewhat incomplete protection because our outbound\r\npeers could be down but not timed out or might all be on 'local'\r\nnetworks (although the requirement for multiple netgroups helps).\r\n\r\nwhich, I don't fully understand. is this referring to a scenario where a node is only able to connect to other nodes within a local network environment, so would have frequent failures when trying to connect to the bitcoin network at large? and if this is the case, how could we distinguish this behavior pattern from a node running only on Tor and having all outbound peers from the same netgroup? \r\n\r\nRE 4 bits to 5 bits in `GetGroup()`:\r\nI agree with @mzumsande in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27369#issuecomment-1490395263 \r\n> I think there are two aspects to this that don't necessarily need be addressed at the same time:\r\n> 1. The rule not to make more than one outbound connection to a netgroup\r\n> 2. Netgroup-based bucketing in addrman\r\n>\r\n> [...]\r\n>\r\n> So, in the short term (25.0), I think that we should either temporarily revert https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/72e8ffd7f8dbf908e65da6d012ede914596737ab or do what @stratospher suggested, if that could still make it into the release.\r\n\r\nThe implications of changing from 4 to 5 bits in `GetGroup` are nuanced because of the impacts on addrman distributions, so I think we should evaluate it separately from this PR, which is currently marked for the 25.0 milestone.",

I believe that an adversary looking to exploit this can really only do so for (eg) new nodes that have a relatively small addrman, by flooding such a node with onion addresses; but that attack is already available today (since we have 16 different onion netgroups, an adversary creating a zillion onion addresses to eclipse a victim will just have the ones that are in different netgroups be the ones that eclipse a peer, instead of ones in the same netgroup).\r\n\r\nI agree with sdaftuar. I think that keeping the netgroup-based limiting in the case where we can connect to more than 1 network is unnecessary, because the current AddrMan logic puts the alternative networks already at a disadvantage compared to clearnet, and the current netgroup just amplifies that by sometimes not picking an alt-net peer and then picking another clearnet peer instead.\r\nSo while having too many alt-net peers is not typically an issue in non-adverse scenarios, the netgroup restriction doesn't even really help that much in an adverse scenario of an attacker trying to eclipse us, because with 10 outbound peers and 16 netgroups, having all alt-net peers would still be possible (unless we also have manual connections!)\r\n\r\n> (I can't recall what that fraction is though, can someone remind us?)\r\n\r\nFrom a single fixed source, we can fill 16 buckets (1024 addrs) with onion addresses - that is, for example the case for inbound onion peers, because we see them as `127.0.0.1`. We can fill 64 buckets with IPv4 or IPv6 addresses from a single source.\r\n\r\nCounting multiple sources from the same alternative network, they can fill up a theoretical maximum of 256 buckets (~16k addresses) or 1/4 of the new tables I think (but due to collisions from the the modulo operations in `GetNewBucket` and `GetBucketPosition` that depend on `nKey`, it is typically more like ~200 buckets in reality).\r\nOn the other hand, multiple IPv4 and IPv6 sources can fill up all 1024 buckets in the `new` table.\r\n\r\n> which, I don't fully understand. is this referring to a scenario where a node is only able to connect to other nodes within a local network environment, so would have frequent failures when trying to connect to the bitcoin network at large? and if this is the case, how could we distinguish this behavior pattern from a node running only on Tor and having all outbound peers from the same netgroup?\r\n\r\nYes, I think that's the scenario - a temporary network failure that wouldn't apply to peers you are locally connected to. I don't think it's a problem if you are running `-onlynet=onion` because even if the peer you are connected to is within your network, you would fail to connect to it because you wouldn't be connecting to them directly but through onion routing (which would fail if the internet is down).",

      "body": "> however, the OP of that post also states:\r\n\r\n>> This is still somewhat incomplete protection because our outbound\r\npeers could be down but not timed out or might all be on 'local'\r\nnetworks (although the requirement for multiple netgroups helps).\r\n\r\n@amitiuttarwar Thanks for finding this, I hadn't thought about the issue of wanting to distinguish between local and non-local IPV4 networks for the purposes of detecting whether a node's network connectivity is down.\r\n\r\nThis means my suggestion of just summing outbound peers, rather than looking at netgroup diversity of peers, isn't great. I now think we could sum the IPV4/IPV6 entries in setConnected and add that to the total number of outbound alt-network peers (basically treating every alt-network peer as a distinct entry in setConnected), and use that for this check?\r\n\r\nEDIT: for the avoidance of doubt, I wrote a patch to implement my suggested approach [here](https://github.com/sdaftuar/bitcoin/commit/29807e1e25458a8e7ab859c6565e2f840ea38f3a).",

      "body": "Thanks a lot @sdaftuar! I've used the simplified approach in your patch! \r\n\r\n> Counting multiple sources from the same alternative network, they can fill up a theoretical maximum of 256 buckets (~16k addresses) or 1/4 of the new tables I think (but due to collisions from the the modulo operations in GetNewBucket and GetBucketPosition that depend on nKey, it is typically more like ~200 buckets in reality).\r\nOn the other hand, multiple IPv4 and IPv6 sources can fill up all 1024 buckets in the new table.\r\n\r\ntried a similar calculation for tried tables - which depends on netgroup of [tor address](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5a8bd4505687a7ec76d731b1a8249ee04d641990/src/addrman.cpp#L49)(16 group possibilities) and `hash1%8` which has 8 possibilities. that's 2^7 bucket possibilities out of 2^8 tried table buckets which is 1/2 the tried table.\r\n\r\nin an ideal theoretical ipv4 + tor scenario, the chance of all 8 outbound connections turning out to be tor would be = (50% new + 50 % tried)^8  \r\n- if src of all tor address is tor = (0.5 * 0.25 + 0.5 * 0.5)^8 = approx 0.04% (even less than this real scenario)   \r\n- if src of all tor address is ipv4 = (0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0.5)^8 = approx 10% (even less than this in real scenario)\r\n\r\ni guess these are the upper bound probability of this scenario happening. it is anyways covered in the comments above related to how netgroup restrictions for Tor/I2P/CJDNS don't make much difference in adverse situations.\r\n \r\n\r\n> This would double the number of addrman slots that can be used by Tor peers, right? My off the cuff guess is that this would be undesirable, but I haven't gone back to figure out what fraction of the addrman this would be yet.\r\n\r\n> The implications of changing from 4 to 5 bits in GetGroup are nuanced because of the impacts on addrman distributions, so I think we should evaluate it separately from this PR\r\n\r\nthanks for explaining! makes sense, noticed how this would result in tor/i2p/cjdns addresses filling the entire addrman.\r\n\r\n\r\n>  I now think we could sum the IPV4/IPV6 entries in setConnected and add that to the total number of outbound alt-network peers (basically treating every alt-network peer as a distinct entry in setConnected), and use that for this check?\r\n\r\nI liked this approach!\r\n\r\n`setConnected.size() >= min(nMaxConnections - 1, 2)`\r\n\r\nsince we include manual connections in `setConnected`, something else which would change now is we'd record failure attempts when we attempt an outbound connection and are already sufficiently connected to just manual peers. i think this is desirable/aligned with the original intent of why `setConnected.size() >= min(nMaxConnections - 1, 2)` was written.\r\n\r\n`nMaxConnections` [do not include](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/init.cpp#L936-L939) manual connections right? (`nMaxConnections` limit is default 125, manual connection limit is default 8 (not included in 125)). and `setConnected.size()` would include them. in a rare scenario in resource constrained systems (if ever `nMaxConnections`=2) and we only have manual connections, it's possible that we end up recording addrman failure attempts. but i guess that's alright.\r\n",

          "body": "# Session Details\r\n- Date: 13-04-2023\r\n- Time: IST 20:00 (UTC 14:30)\r\n- PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27374\r\n- Context: `[Net][P2P]`\r\n- Difficulty: Moderate\r\n- Language: `[python][c++]`\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n* There are 2 main types of P2P connections \r\n    - Inbound connections = if your peer initiates the connection\r\n    - Outbound connection = if you initiate the connection to your peer\r\n* See all P2P connection types [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d544d03ba6c7ed3c5879c8bc1108f45d0aac2798/src/node/connection_types.h#L17-L77).\r\n* It might be possible for a malicious adversary to consume all your inbound connection slots. So it's important to select a diverse set of IP addresses for your outbound connections in order to be more resilient against [eclipse attacks](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eclipse-attacks/).\r\n* Netgroups/Network groups are used to understand IP address diversity. See [`GetGroup()` in `src/netgroup.h`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d544d03ba6c7ed3c5879c8bc1108f45d0aac2798/src/netgroup.h#L25-L35).\r\n* [#27264](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27264) changed the logic of how peers from diverse netgroups were selected for establishing outbound connections.\r\n    * before, we used to open persistent outbound connections to peers which have different netgroups compared to outbound full relay, block relay, addrfetch and feeler connection peers.\r\n    * now, we open persistent outbound connections to peers which have different netgroups compared to outbound full relay, block relay and manual connection peers.\r\n* However, Tor/I2P/CJDNS networks have only 16 possible distinct network groups. Network groups for Tor/I2P/CJDNS networks don't make sense since they are public key based network and not routing based. Also, they use only [4 variable bits](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d544d03ba6c7ed3c5879c8bc1108f45d0aac2798/src/netgroup.cpp#L50-L57) in the `GetGroup()` logic resulting in 2**4 possibilities for netgroups. \r\n* Bitcoin core allows 8 manual connections maximum and 8 outbound full relay connections maximum by default.\r\n* So problem happens when you run a bitcoin core node on Tor-only (or I2P, CJDNS). If all these 8 + 8 connections have distinct netgroups, we don't have netgroups remaining for [block relay only connections](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/112829/136416).\r\n* Moreover, netgroup diversity when opening persitent outbound connections doesn't conceptually make sense in Tor/I2P/CJDNS since their IP addresses are not route-based.\r\n\r\n# Conceptual Questions\r\n1. What are different types of outbound connections? Can you point region in code where these connections are established? hint: look in [`ThreadOpenConnections()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d544d03ba6c7ed3c5879c8bc1108f45d0aac2798/src/net.cpp#L1611)\r\n2. What's a netgroup? Why is netgroup diversity important when making an outbound connection?\r\n3. How is netgroup diversity maintained when establishing outbound connections? hint: [#27264](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27264)\r\n\r\n# PR related Questions\r\n1. Did you review the PR? Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK? What was your review approach?\r\n2. What problem does this PR solve?\r\n3. Why skip netgroup diversity checks when establishing outbound connections to Tor/I2P/CJDNS networks?\r\n5. What does `fCountFailure` do?\r\n6. What would happen if `outbound_privacy_network_peers` was absent in the code?\r\n7. optional: why increasing 4 bits to 5 bits in [GetGroup() logic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d544d03ba6c7ed3c5879c8bc1108f45d0aac2798/src/netgroup.cpp#L50-L57) (to increase total number of possible netgroups for Tor/I2P/CJDNS from 16 possibilities to 2**5 possibilities) isn't desirable.\r\n\r\n# Learning\r\n - Net\r\n - In/OutBound connections\r\n - Net Grouping\r\n> Note: Drop your PR and review related questions below",

Yes. Is this unlikely problem? Yes, with a common addrman that is filled mostly with IPv4 addresses. With a non-common addrman? I do not know.",

(See also these polls for fun: users https://twitter.com/jonatack/status/1629173539067527171 / bitcoin devs https://twitter.com/jonatack/status/1631717328416014336).\r\n\r\nPerhaps increasingly so, based on the increase in the number of Tor v3 and I2P peers reported by `-addrinfo` over the past year or so, now up to 15k onion and 1300 I2P peers, i.e. recently active / non-IsTerrible ones. (I2P peers in particular increased significantly recently after 2 node-in-a-box packages added support in December 2022.)",

          "title": "Increase # of block-relay-only connections ",
          "body": "## tldr:\r\nBlock-relay-only connections help improve partition resistance on the bitcoin network by increasing connectivity while obfuscating the network graph. To be conservative and reduce chances of unexpected network effects, initially 2 outbound block-relay-only connections per node were introduced. Since then, we have improved resource utilization and network behaviors to work towards increasing that number. Now, let’s try and do it!\r\n\r\nThis is joint work with mzumsande. #28463 proposes a specific implementation to increase the number of inbound slots for block-relay-only connections, which is a prerequisite to later increase the outbound slots. This issue is a place to discuss any conceptual questions or concerns.\r\n\r\n## History & Context: \r\nIn 2019, PR [#15759](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759) introduced 2 outbound block-relay-only connections for bitcoind nodes. The primary motivation of introducing these connections was to help obfuscate the network graph, since leaked information could help an adversary execute a partition attack. \r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, there was open questioning around how many block-relay-only connections we should add. More increases robustness but effects to consider include resource utilization and addr relay implications. Introducing 2 extra connections was evaluated to be a good first step that balanced tangible benefits with potential risk. gmaxwell mentioned in [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-480400958), “ultimately I'd like to optimize memory usage for both inbound and outbound blocksonly links, then at least double the inbound connection limit for blocks only links, and make 8 blocks only links.” @sdaftuar expressed agreement with this direction [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-480868516).\r\n\r\nAt the time, there were a few different mechanisms that would be a cause for concern if the number of block-relay-only connections were increased. Many have been resolved since and we have highlighted one significant question that needs to be evaluated in the context of this proposal. Additionally, reviewers should consider if there may be any other undesirable side effects. \r\n- Addrman interactions (fixed) [PR #20187](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20187): There were a couple of nuanced interactions between block-relay-only connections and addrman that were addressed in this PR. The changes fix a privacy leak, ensure block-relay-only addresses are recognized as reliable connections, and fix a pre-existing addrman bug around active connections. \r\n- Addr relay implications (fixed) [PR #21528](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528): As @ajtowns described in [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-527012757), introducing block-relay-only connections initially degraded the propagation of addr messages on the network. [PR #21528](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528) reduces addr blackholes by improving the behavior for honest nodes. The default behavior was updated to not treat inbound connections as addr relay peers until they indicated interest by initiating an address related p2p message. \r\n- Memory utilization (fixed) [PR #22778](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22778): block-relay-only connections do not require as much memory as transaction relay peers. They don’t need a `TxRelay` data structure, which is significant because the tx relay bloom filter uses approximately 500kb per peer. [PR #22778](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22778) allowed nodes to identify whether an inbound peer might ever relay transactions over the lifetime of the connection, and stop initializing the TxRelay data structure when unnecessary. \r\n- Netgroup limitation (fixed) [PR #27374](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27374): In certain circumstances, the logic to diversify netgroups of our outbound connections was limiting the total number of connections permitted by the node. This PR fixed this issue by applying separate logic for clearnet peers vs privacy network peers. \r\n- Number of available connection slots on the network (OPEN): available connection slots are a shared and limited network resource. Increasing the defaults for outbound connections should be carefully calibrated against the expected values for inbound slots over time. The next section shares context for how numbers have been selected for our proposal, and this is an area where we are very interested in reviewer feedback. \r\n- Is there anything else we are missing? \r\n\r\n\r\n## Availability of Connection Slots: \r\n#### Context \r\nThe patch in #28463 proposes values based on observing network statistics & calculating expected memory utilization. This section provides more reasoning behind selecting those numbers, so reviewers can evaluate the methodology.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental question is: how much do we need to increase inbound capacity to accommodate for increasing the number of outbounds from 10 to 16. This is tricky to answer with precision because (1) estimating the number of non-reachable nodes is hard and (2) these numbers will inevitably change over time, and we want to accommodate for fluctuations. \r\n\r\nThere is no way to guarantee sufficient connection slots - if all users disabled inbounds, the network would fail. However, we can still observe network behaviors to build confidence around projecting likely proportions that would be maintained over time. After all, the default number of 8 outbound connections dates back to [satoshi code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/94cfec07fd302c9ff9b6a80c47418d4fe56596ae) from 2010, and has successfully held up over the years 🙂\r\n\r\n#### Estimating the number of reachable clearnet nodes (per sept 2023)\r\n6155 ([bitnodes](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/))\r\n8509 ([KIT](https://www.dsn.kastel.kit.edu/bitcoin/data/churn0-v.gpd))\r\n3862 ([Luke Dashjr](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/historical.html))\r\n7910 ([21 Ninja](https://21.ninja/reachable-nodes/nodes-by-net-type/))\r\n\r\nQuality of data: The bitnodes number is verifiable because peers can be queried, and a random sampling has demonstrated a high probability of successfully connecting. Luke Dashjr reports significantly lower than the other two, but the methodology is not disclosed. The data from 21 Ninja also clearly specifies its methodology and crawler code.\r\n\r\n#### Estimating the number of non-reachable clearnet nodes \r\n50956 ([Luke](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/historical.html), sept 2023, unknown methodology and included networks)\r\n32300 ([KIT Addr Spam Paper](https://www.dsn.kastel.kit.edu/publications/2022-Bitcoin-Degree.pdf) 07/21, estimated from the degrees calculated from observed addr spam)\r\n27000 - 35000 ([KIT Monitoring Paper](https://fc22.ifca.ai/preproceedings/114.pdf) 12/21, estimated from the number of gossip addrs received)\r\n35000 ([bitnodes](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes), estimated from gossip addrs received)\r\n\r\nQuality of data: Both KIT methods don’t take into account nodes that don’t self-advertise (e.g. listen=0, or SPV clients) but do permit inbound slots. Estimating based on addr gossip is going to include many spam addresses, so may provide a reasonable upper bound.\r\n\r\n#### Extrapolating numbers\r\nLet’s use rough estimates of 8,000 reachable clearnet nodes & 40,000 non-reachable nodes. \r\n\r\nEstimated slots required for each increment to the default number of outbound connections: 48,000. \r\nRequired additional inbound slots for each increment to default outbounds: 48000/8000 = 6.\r\n\r\nWith the current network estimates, we would need at least 6 additional inbound slots for each increment to the default number of outbounds. To be more conservative, we should probably add ~8-10 inbound slots for each additional outbound. \r\n\r\nThis is all only clearnet. However, it seems likely that inbound capacity for privacy networks are higher in comparison, because unlike clearnet, there is no need to unblock ports, so accepting inbounds is the default behavior. While node operators are able to easily disable those inbounds, we’d anticipate that to happen less frequently than on clearnet where the reverse effort is required. \r\n\r\n## Future work: \r\nWe need users to adopt the changes to increase the default for inbound block-relay-only connections before we can safely increase the default for outbounds. #28463 proposes the increase in inbounds. If these changes are accepted, we would want to wait until the corresponding release is widely adopted, then have a future release update the outbound default.\r\n\r\nAnchors were implemented using block-relay-only connections to mitigate against restart-based eclipse attacks. For more context see [issue #17326](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17326) & [PR #17428](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428). If we increase the number of outbound block-relay-only connections, we will want to thoughtfully design the interactions with anchors. As sdaftuar mentions in [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428#issuecomment-554073351), we will likely want to cap the anchors at 2, which entails selection logic. In [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213#issuecomment-1478551323), @brunoerg mentions the idea of having (at least) one anchor per network instead of just two generic ones. While discussing this in depth would be premature, we also want to keep these implications and options in mind as we advance the current work.",

This is because the Tor network is global (same for I2P or CJDNS). There is no such thing as \"local area network\" of Tor nodes (e.g. `10.0.0.0/24`) or localhost Tor address (like `127.0.0.1` in IPv4). If we are connected to one Tor node, it means we are not offline and can possibly connect to other Tor nodes as well.\r\n\r\nMaybe out of the scope of this PR, but would it not be better to change that logic to: \"if we are connected to at least one `CNetAddr::IsRoutable()` IPv4/6 address or at least one Tor address or at least one I2P or at least one CJDNS address, then we are not offline\"?\r\n\r\ncc @gmaxwell ",

Requiring two connections to be up (versus just 1 connection to e.g. Tor, or some other non-local ipv4/ipv6 network) is a tradeoff around how long we spend in a state where we're punishing addrman entries while we might be offline and just haven't noticed it yet, vs not punishing entries for being down when our network is up.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that most nodes on the network don't have local network peers, and so the effect of this logic for most users since it was deployed in #8065 -- requiring 2 non-local outbound connections before we start punishing addrman entries for failed attempts -- will be the same after this PR is merged.\r\n\r\nIf someone can figure out that it's more optimal for this to be 1 or 3 or some other value, I think we can pick that up in a new PR; however I'd suspect it doesn't matter too much, and that 2 is likely better than 1...",
