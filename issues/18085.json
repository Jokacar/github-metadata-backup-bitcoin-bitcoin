After entering the passphrase, it deflates/decrypts metadata, keypools, descriptors into memory only.\r\n* A password re-entry when spends happen could still be made (eventually with the short inmemory timespan KDF-ed key)\r\n* Enter the passphrase more often (at startup / load-time of a wallet plus additional timeout) prevents from lost funds through lost passphrase.",

          "title": "[Design] New 'Create Wallet' user flow. ",
          "body": "## Overview of current and new create wallet user flow\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287964/91424131-fc58d600-e88b-11ea-9e23-bed5aa18126f.png)\r\n\r\n## 1.0 Who is this being designed for? \r\n\r\nI am under the assumption that currently the Bitcoin core GUI primarily caters to Bitcoin power users and or developers who are okay with usability trade offs for improved security and more robustly audited code. With the GUI being one of the most secure, simple ways to run a full node, and if a goal of the Bitcoin community is to have as many full nodes as possible (which I presume it is), then we need the GUI to cater to a wider, less technical audience. \r\n\r\nThe aim of my designs is to remove friction for beginner and power users without having any security and or privacy trade offs, as well as have as minimal technical hurdles. Primarily, however, my goal is to make the GUI more beginner friendly. The Bitcoin core GUI in my view should be a benchmark / reference implementation and should not aim to be a flashy node software like [umbrel](https://getumbrel.com/) or [mynode](https://mynodebtc.com/) – but this does not mean usability improvements cant be made. A well designed GUI will also further improve the security and privacy of its users - for this reason core should put more emphasis on design implementations. With good design, both the beginners and power users will be able to send and receive bitcoin backed by their own full node using the GUI without trade offs. \r\n\r\n## 2.0 Problems being solved\r\n\r\nThe current user flow for creating a new wallet does not explain to users the types of wallets you can create or how each wallet type is different. Furthermore, the types of wallets available to create use terminology that is likely unfamiliar to many users (e.g. ‘Disable private keys’ could just be named ‘Watch Only Wallet’ which is more common and describes the same kind of wallet) - Luke Jr brang up this concern in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17879.\r\n\r\nThe encrypt wallet option should be part of the create new wallet user flow and not optional (but also not mandatory – see below). The current initial modal that is presented does nothing to educate the user of the importance and pitfalls (not recoverable) of encrypting your wallet. This information could be included in the first modal but to keep things minimal and clean this should focus on ‘Choose your wallet type’ options whilst ‘Encrypt your wallet’ should have its on modal to fully explain why/why not to encrypt. Having encrypt wallet as part of the user flow by default will likely lead to better security of users bitcoin – An example being users will be more likely encrypt their wallets if informed why they should, this will lead to less stolen (but possibly more lost) bitcoins. If we want beginners using the GUI (meaning many more nodes) simple content changes such as this are important. Some discussions around this occurred in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17879.\r\n\r\nA general clean up of the UI without any drastic changes was also made.  The design scope is quite limited due to Qt Widgets inheriting most components from the host OS. A cleaner UI generally leads to a smoother user experience. Nothing too fancy was done here, mostly some hierarchical separation of text, cleaner inputs and more consistent padding. \r\n\r\nFrom a wider GUI perspective I chose to focus on the create new wallet feature first as creating a wallet and creating it securely is one of the most important things a bitcoin user can do so I figured this was a top priority. \r\n\r\n## 3.0 Solutions\r\n\r\nBelow are the designs I have made with comments, along with the current screens for comparison. You can also view the [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/FJ02rY3m8V9ZCDvoXjW39W/Bitcoin-Core?node-id=281%3A0) (opens in your desktop fine) if you want to view the source files and more specific details of the design. You can leave comments on my figma file by clicking the speech bubble in the top left and clicking the area of the design you want to comment on. Designs are done using the WindowsOS Qt widgets inherited styling. Linux and Mac versions will inherit their own styling but the primary elements will be consistent.  \r\n\r\n### 3.1 Create Wallet Meta\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287964/91424401-5194e780-e88c-11ea-88eb-d1364e758e5a.png)\r\n\r\nThis is the first modal that pops up when creating a wallet, it is quite vague what it is the user needs to do here #69. Here are some questions that users likely have but are unanswered of which I aimed to answer or avoid the user having in the above new design – Why do I encrypt my wallet? It is selected by default so it must be important, but why is it important? What does disable private keys mean and why would I want that? Why is it disabled by default? What is a blank wallet and why would I want that? What are these options anyways? When I click create what exactly am I creating? \r\n\r\nFor a cleaner more practical flow, the first modal should focus on the meta of wallet creation such as the name / wallet type and move secondary steps like encrypting to a subsequent modal. Several wallet types can be created which is not clearly communicated, nor is what each of those wallet types can do. I included a standard wallet option which should be selected by default as this is likely the most common wallet type users will create. The encrypt wallet option has been moved to its own modal and should be a default option for creating any type of wallet (details in design below).\r\n\r\n#### Minor Changes\r\nThe wallet name input should be pre-filled in with text such as ‘MyWallet1’ for users who want to quickly make a wallet. If the user already has say one wallet then the pre-filled text should be ‘MyWallet2,’ they have two wallets ‘MyWallet3,’ etc. This creates a quicker user flow and better user experience. Electrum wallet does this nicely when creating a new wallet. \r\n\r\nRemoved the help button ‘?’ at the top – currently does nothing and the new design should clarify any confusion the user may have- #74.\r\n\r\n### 3.2 Create Wallet Encryption\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287964/91424756-ce27c600-e88c-11ea-92f7-ab8dc17f6d05.png)\r\n\r\nCurrently the encrypt wallet option is a toggled feature in the first modal, but as explained above this modal should focus on wallet meta options like wallet type/name. The encrypt wallet modal should be presented to all users after picking a wallet type regardless of the wallet type chosen and should clearly emphasize the pros and cons of encrypting. It should also still be optional to not encrypt your wallet which can be done by leaving the passphrase input blank – though the warnings should push users more towards encrypting for better security / privacy. A modal should pop up (last frame shown above) confirming the user does not want to encrypt if they leave the passphrase input blank.  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17879.\r\n\r\nMuch of this emphasis on the pros and cons of encrypting is placed AFTER the user encrypts their wallet in subsequent modals which does not make sense – the emphasis should be placed before they decide to encrypt or not. I did this by including the details from the modals that usually pop up after entering a passphrase at the header of this modal. I also added a warning in red to clearly indicate that cons of encrypting. Lastly, I added a checkbox input that must be clicked before the ‘create’ button can be clicked which finishes the wallet creation process. \r\n\r\n#### Minor Changes:\r\n Moved the passphrase visibility toggle to icons on each passphrase input. This is a cleaner, more user friendly approach. Also made each input have their own toggle rather than a toggle that just shows both inputs when clicked like in the current design. These are two new icons not currently in the GUI that will need to be added to implement this design. \r\n\r\n### 3.3 Create Wallet extra redundant modals\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287964/91421619-b9e1ca00-e888-11ea-8cc3-bc969d78c1a7.png)\r\n\r\nWith a more detailed encrypt wallet modal the two subsequent modals (shown above) can be removed making the create wallet process more seamless and involve less steps.\r\n\r\n**Next Steps**\r\n\r\nThis was mostly a re-modelling of what currently exists - no extra frames / steps have been added. However, going forward I would also like to setup a user flow in this create wallet section of the GUI for watch only wallets and blank wallets. Such as having the ability to enter a xpub for watch only wallets in the creation process rather than in the settings after the wallet is created like it currently is. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to some feedback!",

      "body": "> A possible option could be to encrypt not only the keys (or the seed later) but also the metadata (derived addresses, scripts, labels, transactions) and request the passphrase at startup.\r\n\r\nThis would be an improvement on the current GUI UX and improve privacy in some niche scenarios (such as jonas's first scenario). Most wallets I know of also currently do this so would be more familiar to new users / easier to onboard them. \r\n\r\nAnother suggestion could be a reminder the to re-enter their password using spaced repetition to prevent uses forgetting / miss placing their password - [signal private messenger](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059792-Signal-PIN) does this well. \r\n\r\n> Signal includes a built-in reminder feature that uses spaced repetition. To help you memorize your PIN, Signal will periodically ask you to confirm it. These reminders occur at the following intervals after the feature is first enabled:\r\n>    12 Hours\r\n>     1 Day\r\n>     3 Days\r\n>     7 Days\r\n>     14 Days \r\n\r\nCC @GBKS @johnsBeharry",

          "title": "Who is the GUI being designed for? -Continued Discussion-",
          "body": "I'd like to continue the discussion from [#17395](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17395) over at the bitcoin repo started by @michaelfolkson. \r\n\r\nThe two questions posed by Michael a long with summarized replies from the original thread are below. As someone who is interested in contributing to the design of the GUI I've also included some of my own opinions throughout. \r\n\r\n> 1. Who are we designing the GUI for? Long term Core contributors (highly technical) that use the GUI on a regular basis? I don't know how many of these there are. Technically curious who use the GUI when they can't work out how to do something from the command line? Complete Bitcoin beginners? All of these groups? If it is the latter then we should all be under no illusions that compromises are necessary which will mean it is impossible for the design to be optimal for an individual group.\r\n\r\n> 2. Design preferences are subject to the \"sample size of 1\" trap where those reviewing GUI changes think they are providing feedback on behalf of a group that they don't belong to. A highly technical user just does not know what is optimal for a beginner. The only way you see what is optimal for a beginner is putting alternative GUIs in the hands of a statistically significant group of beginners.\r\n\r\n- The GUI is intended for 'power users,' not beginners, intermediate or devs. Power users being those who are technically competent to run their own node, have basic CLI skills, but are still more comfortable with a simpler UI.\r\n\r\nI think devs also fall within the user base albeit not as frequent as the power users (say if the dev wants to do a simple task in a few clicks). Over time and with good design we can include all users (see below).\r\n\r\n- In the future the GUI should also include beginners and intermediate users, although not at the expense of removing important features or negatively impacting security, privacy, control etc. \r\n\r\nI don't see this as an issue as good design should be able to cater to both experienced and inexperienced users. As an example see [this exchange](https://medium.com/lgogroup/introducing-lgos-trading-interface-77967e4e108e) which offers different interfaces for differing user skills - taken from [crypto UX handbook](https://www.cryptouxhandbook.com/user-onboarding). Good usability is synonymous with good security - Casa articulates this much better in their [wealth security protocol.](https://docs.keys.casa/wealth-security-protocol/system-design-principles/usability-is-security) \r\n\r\n- The GUI does not need to be flashy / modern looking.\r\n\r\nI agree with this but this is in many ways unrelated to good design. A flashy look can increase usability is not synonymous with Aesthetics. As long as its fulfills its job thats all the matters. At this stage that job being having any level of user being able to run a node and have a wallet attached to that node (whether wallet features are used in the GUI or \r\n\r\n- Designers need to work within the constraints of Qt.\r\n\r\nGood point to make but I don't think the constraints are as big as made out to be in the original thread. As Christoph Ono, who worked on the designs for the Monero GUI which also uses Qt, pointed out a small team managed to revamp the UI/UX of the GUI over a few years without too many issues, see [here](https://github.com/GBKS/monero-wallet-design). @GBKS \r\n\r\n- Having a modular GUI / multiple implementations to cater to different user bases.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above I think good design can cater to all audiences within the same app, having a modular GUI is not an efficient way to go about things in my opinion.  \r\n\r\n- What is the main purpose of the GUI? _\"Note that the GUI is needed for more than just the wallet... right now, it is the only realistic way for a normal end user to run their own node at all.\"_ @luke-jr \r\n\r\nLuke also mentions \"...Bitcoin's security depends on a super-majority of the economy using their own full node.\" This isn't possible without including beginner and intermediate users which can only be done through well articulated design. \r\n\r\nAlthough this will likely be a controversial take, is the discontinuation of the GUI once enough options exist outside of core for users to run a fully validating node an option? Projects such as [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel) and [myNode](https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode) are good examples of non-GUI fully validating nodes. If these become more popular among users for running a node than the GUI, is the resources put into it worthwhile when they could be applied to making bitcoins foundations even stronger?\r\n\r\n- Many usability improvements are being worked on on the technical side - [1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16966) [2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9483) [3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7949)\r\n\r\nWith initiatives such as [Bitcoin Design](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign) and [square crypto design grants](https://medium.com/@squarecrypto/bringing-together-the-bitcoin-design-community-b89e5fbe080f) on offer, many more designers are likely to start contributing to open source bitcoin projects like the GUI. It's important that discussions like this happen so that designers and devs are on the same page. \r\n\r\nI'd encourage devs to join the [bitcoin design slack](https://join.slack.com/t/bitcoindesign/shared_invite/zt-fv00xzev-mfHaAsexPsu~QBlufPxL~g) and for designers to frequent this repo and join in on discussions when they can. \r\n",

If i am not content with my password, I cannot go back and change it. Instead, I have to click the `Cancel` button and start all over. The `Confirm wallet encryption` wallet should introduce a `go back` button that allows me to 'go back' to the `Encrypt Wallet` window. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `Cancel` button in this window can be removed. If we go back we can cancel in the `Encrypt Wallet` window, if we go forward -> read on ...\r\n\r\nIf I was content with my wallet password I can continue on.
