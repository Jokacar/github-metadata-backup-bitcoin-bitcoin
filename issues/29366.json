I’m not giving a wildcard on core sect list members on this concern.\r\n\r\nIf full publicity is an overwhelming personal risk model for some sec list members, they can think more about it and take time to resign, I can understand.

PGP keys usually have a mail in their metadata, so you can simply pick the PGP keys and the corresponding mail addresses. You are also free to limit the initial disclosure to a smaller group of recipients and then widen it, as you see fit, as the discussion progresses.
