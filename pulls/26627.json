    "body": "Based on #26626\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the legacy to descriptor wallet migration from creating a new `combo()` for every individual key to creating one large `combo()` that has a list of every key. This improves the performance of the migrated wallet as it will only have one DescriptorSPKM for all of the non-HD keys.\r\n\r\nNote that this does not affect previously migrated wallets. Such wallets will still have a `combo()` for every key.",

This is done in various places, such as `IsMine`, and helper functions for fetching a `ScriptPubKeyMan` and a `SolvingProvider`. This also has a bit of a performance impact on standard descriptor wallets, although less noticeable due to the small number of SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAs these functions are based on doing `IsMine` for each `ScriptPubKeyMan`, we can improve this performance by caching `IsMine` scriptPubKeys for all descriptors and use that to determine which `ScriptPubKeyMan` to actually use for those things. This cache is used exclusively and we no longer iterate the SPKMs.\r\n\r\nAlso added a benchmark for `IsMine`.",

          "title": "wallet: rpc to add automatically generated descriptors",
          "body": "It is useful to have a RPC that can create and add the automatically generated descriptors (that are normally made during creation) to a wallet. This is especially useful when a new default descriptor has been implemented as it allows wallets created before that time to quickly and easily add that type of descriptor.\r\n\r\nIn particular, descriptor wallets created before Taproot was implemented can use the new `createwalletdescriptor` RPC in order to get a Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to keep the newly generated descriptor in line with the existing descriptors, this PR uses #26728 as it exposes a \"wallet extended key\" for us (in addition to upgrading wallets implemented prior to have a wallet xpub). The newly generated descriptors will use the \"wallet extended key\" stored in `CWallet` that PR adds.\r\n\r\n`createwalletdescriptor` is generic and so it can also be used with the other address types. Of course, it given the same wallet extended key, address type, and internal-ness, it will create the same descriptor. So some refactoring has been done in order to detect that the same descriptor is about to be created, and to avoid overwriting any existing descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo be able to use `createwalletdescriptor` with the other address types, we need a way to change the wallet extended key, and so `sethdseed` has been updated and enabled for descriptor wallets. As with legacy wallets, when called without parameters, it will generate a new random master key for the wallet. It can also take a xprv and set that as the master key. It still takes a BIP 32 seed as WIF or as hex as we do for legacy wallets. The seed will be transformed into and stored as a BIP 32 extended key. The latter is to give us greater compatibility with other wallets which often produce non-WIF HD seeds.",

          "body": "Builds on top of #25907 and one commit from #22341.\r\n\r\nFirst this PR introduces a descriptor wallet RPC `addhdseed`. Similar to its legacy wallet counterpart `sethdseed` it either generates a fresh random seed, for use on a blank wallet, or the user can provide a WIF. Unlike `sethdseed` this RPC call does not add keys / fill the keypool.\r\n\r\nThis allows a user to create a blank wallet (`createwallet`), provide it with a seed (`addhdseed`) and then craft custom descriptors. (An alternative approach would to add a `nodescriptors` argument to `createwallet`, but this RPC seems useful anyway)\r\n\r\nAn example use case of this is setting up a multisig between Core and a hardware wallet. After adding the seed to an otherwise empty wallet, the user would call `getxpub m/87'/0'/0'`. They would then combine this `xpub` and origin info with the one from their hardware wallet (e.g. using `hwi --fingerprint .... getxpub m/87'/0'/0'`  and craft a descriptor like `wsh(sorted_multi(2, [...../87'/0'/0']our_xpub, [..../87'/0'/0']their_xpub))`, and import that. The resulting wallet will be able to sign its part of the transaction.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this PR enables to ability descriptors, such as in the multisig example above, in such a way that any `fingerprint` + `xpub` that is covered by our hd seed(s) can be signed for.",

          "body": "This PR changes DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan to no longer handle relevant keys directly. Instead all keys for all DescriptorSPKMs will be handled by a new `KeyManager` class which exists within `CWallet` (a reference to it is passed to each DescriptorSPKM). This allows us to have a concept of a wallet HD key for descriptor wallets. This makes it easier to add new single key descriptors that use the same HD master key as the rest of the autogenerated descriptors (e.g. for taproot). Multisigs will also be easier as an xpub belonging to the wallet can be exported without needing to do weird things like descriptor introspection and guessing about which descriptor's key to use.\r\n\r\n`KeyManager` is a class which handles all of the keys for DescriptorSPKMs. It contains the maps that hold the keys, deals with writing those keys to disk, and handles their encryption. Encryption keys are still managed by `CWallet` but provided to `KeyManager` through the `WalletStorage` interface. Signing is still done through `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan::SignTransaction` however this will fetch the keys from `KeyManager` rather than storing keys in the DescriptorSPKM to be used.\r\n\r\nThis change is backwards compatible. Although `KeyManager` writes and uses keys in new `keyman_key` and `keyman_ckey` records, it will still write keys for each descriptor in `walletdescriptorkey` and `walletdescriptorckey` records. This allows a descriptor wallet created using this change to be opened by 22.0 and 0.21. Additionally, wallets created with older software will automatically be upgraded to using the `KeyManager` at first loading. This is done in the background and does not require any user interaction (i.e. no passphrase required).",

          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",

          "body": "Depends on #26728\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new wallet RPC `getxpub`. It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",

With this change `listdescriptors` will use `h`, so you can copy-paste the result, without having to add escape characters or switch `'` to 'h' manually.\r\n\r\nBoth markers can still be parsed.\r\n\r\nThe `hdkeypath` field in `getaddressinfo` is also impacted by this change, except for legacy wallets. The latter is to prevent accidentally breaking ancient software that uses our legacy wallet. \r\n\r\nSee discussion in #15740",

          "title": "[WIP] wallet: standardize change output detection process",
          "body": "Depends on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27601, please go there first.\r\n\r\nThis work aims to define, and implement a base standard mechanism to\r\ndetect individual change outputs.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nCurrently, the wallet detects whether an output is change or not based\r\non data stored in the address book.\r\n\r\nThere is no notion of “change outputs”, the wallet detects change scripts.\r\n\r\nConnoting that any address book record modification has implications\r\non all the historical outputs related to that particular destination. Meaning\r\nthat all those outputs can either be change or not. There is no middle-ground\r\ngranular distinction.\r\n\r\n#### How Change Detection Currently Works?\r\n\r\nThe wallet walks-through the transaction outputs, extracts the script\r\ndestination and verify the following two points:\r\n\r\n1) If the destination doesn't exist in the address book, then the script\r\n    is a \"change address\".\r\n   \r\n2) If the destination exists in the address book, but it doesn't have a\r\n     label, then the script is a \"change address\".\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are a good number of problems in the current approach:\r\n\r\n- We make the wallet dependent on an external structure, with separate storage.\r\n   Which has to be updated and maintained along with the wallet state.\r\n\r\n- It cannot be maintained nor recovered across different wallet instances.\r\n   Cannot re-create the, possibly custom, address book data only by importing\r\n   the wallet descriptor string.\r\n\r\n- As the address book is an structure that the user can freely modify, the change\r\n   detection process might differ through different wallets.\r\n \r\n- The current rudimentary assumptions of \"no address book entry\" or \"no label set for the address book entry\"\r\n  to denote that certain script destination is change or not can easily be broken:\r\n  E.g. derive an address from one of the wallet’s external paths manually. Then send coins to it.\r\n  As the receive destination wasn't created inside the wallet, the wallet has no associated address book entry.\r\n  So, the reception is invalidly detected as change (added a test case for it).\r\n\r\n- The wallet can't detect change outputs on more complex scripts such as multi-sig change outputs.\r\n\r\n- The wallet is not able to detect change outputs going to an internal address if the internal address has a label.\r\n  (E.g. the user can manually set a label for the internal address and, doing that, make that all the change\r\n  outputs, in the wallet history, that were sent to the destination are no longer detected as change).\r\n\r\n- There isn’t a way to distinguish the external reception of coins into an internal address. Coins reception on any\r\n   internal address are always detected as change.\r\n\r\n### New Change Detection Mechanism Goals\r\n\r\nAiming to:\r\n\r\n* Define a base mechanism to align different wallet implementations. Preventing each piece of software\r\n  from diverging on the basic change outputs distinction.\r\n\r\n* Detect change outputs on-demand without requiring to maintain an external data structure synced with the\r\n   latest wallet state.\r\n\r\n* Independently, and accurately, detect change outputs regardless data stored in structures that the user\r\n   can freely modify.\r\n\r\n* Granular distinction between change vs non-change outputs that were sent to the same internal address.\r\n  E.g. the reception of coins, from an external source, on internal addresses will not longer be detected\r\n  as change anymore.\r\n\r\n* Expand the change detection to more complex scripts such as a multi-sig protected addresses. (While they\r\n  are added into the wallet on an internal spkm)\r\n\r\n#### Change Output Detection Rules\r\n\r\nA transaction output is change if it fulfills the following points:\r\n\r\n1) At least one of the parent transaction inputs is from the wallet. (If none of them are, then the wallet is receiving coins\r\n    on an internal address).\r\n\r\n2) The script extracted destination is from the wallet and is located in one of the internal script pub key manager.\r\n    (e.g. derived from an internal derivation path)\r\n\r\n#### What about legacy wallets?\r\n\r\nIf the legacy wallet is HD post-split, we have an internal derivation path, so we can follow the same process as\r\ndescriptors wallet. Unless the destination is on the pre-split key pool, in which case, we fallback to the follow-up\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nIf the legacy wallet is pre-split, we continue using the address book as we either have an HD wallet with keys\r\nderived only on the external path, or we are using raw keypool.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————\r\n\r\n#### Extra Note\r\nThis PR, in about 85% at least, is about expanding the current test coverage for the change output detection area.\r\n\r\n#### TO DO (still WIP):\r\n\r\n* [x] Save “internal” flag on non-active descriptors so the wallet can use them on the change detection process.\r\n   (which will fix the currently failing test cases).\r\n* [ ] Re-organize commits so tests always pass.\r\n* [ ] Verify backwards compatibility.",

This PR adds `BerkeleyRODatabase` which is an independent implementation of a BDB file parser. It can be used to read uncorrupted BDB files and extract all of their records. This is used for both the wallettool's `dump` command, and `migratewallet`.\r\n\r\nBased on #26606 ",

          "body": "For the wallet's unit tests, we currently use either `DummyDatabase` or memory-only versions of either BDB or SQLite. The tests that use `DummyDatabase` just need a `WalletDatabase` so that the `CWallet` can be constructed, while the tests using the memory-only databases just need a backing data store. There is also a `FailDatabase` that is similar to `DummyDatabase` except it fails be default or can have a configured return value. Having all of these different database types can make it difficult to write tests, particularly tests that work when either BDB or SQLite is disabled.\r\n\r\nThis PR unifies all of these different unit test database classes into a single `MockableDatabase`. Like `DummyDatabase`, most functions do nothing and just return true. Like `FailDatabase`, the return value of some functions can be configured on the fly to test various failure cases. Like the memory-only databases, records can actually be written to the `MockableDatabase` and be retrieved later, but all of this is still held in memory. Using `MockableDatabase` completely removes the need for having BDB or SQLite backed wallets in the unit tests for the tests that are not actually testing specific database behaviors.\r\n\r\nBecause `MockableDatabase`s can be created by each unit test, we can also control what records are stored in the database. Records can be added and removed externally from the typical database modification functions. This will give us greater ability to test failure conditions, particularly those involving corrupted records.\r\n\r\nPossible alternative to #26644",

These are moved into `wallet_common.{h/cpp}`.\r\n\r\nThe second commit contains a bugfix for the wallet_balance benchmark where it calls `LoadWallet` in the wrong place. It's unnecessary to call that function in this benchmark. Although this does not cause any issues currently, it ends up causing issues in some PRs and branches that I'm working on.",

          "body": "During initial block download, the node's wallet(s) scans every arriving block looking for data that it owns.\r\nThis process can be resource-intensive, as it involves sequentially scanning all transactions within each\r\narriving block.\r\n\r\nTo avoid wasting processing power, we can skip blocks that occurred before the wallet's creation time, \r\nsince these blocks are guaranteed not to contain any relevant wallet data.\r\n\r\nThis has direct implications (an speed improvement) on the underlying blockchain synchronization process\r\nas well. The reason is that the validation interface queue is limited to 10 tasks per time. This means that no\r\nmore than 10 blocks can be waiting for the wallet(s) to be processed while we are synchronizing the chain\r\n(activating the best chain to be more precise).\r\nWhich can be a bottleneck if blocks arrive and are processed faster from the network than what they are \r\nprocessed by the wallet(s).\r\n\r\nSo, by skipping not relevant blocks in the wallet's IBD scanning process, we will also improve the chain \r\nsynchronization time.",

          "body": "The current descriptor parsing fuzz target requires valid public or private keys to be provided. This is unnecessary as we are only interested in fuzzing the descriptor parsing logic here (other targets are focused on fuzzing keys serializations). And it's pretty inefficient, especially for formats that need a checksum (`xpub`, `xprv`, WIF).\r\n\r\nThis introduces a new target that mocks the keys as an index in a list of precomputed keys. Keys are represented as 2 hex characters in the descriptor. The key type (private, public, extended, ..) is deterministically based on this one-byte value. Keys are deterministically generated at target initialization. This is much more efficient and also largely reduces the size of the seeds.\r\nTL;DR: for instance instead of requiring the fuzzer to generate a `pk(xpub6DdBu7pBoyf7RjnUVhg8y6LFCfca2QAGJ39FcsgXM52Pg7eejUHLBJn4gNMey5dacyt4AjvKzdTQiuLfRdK8rSzyqZPJmNAcYZ9kVVEz4kj)` to parse a valid descriptor, it just needs to generate a `pk(03)`.\r\n\r\nNote we only mock the keys themselves, not the entire descriptor key expression. As we want to fuzz the real code that parses the rest of the key expression (origin, derivation paths, ..).\r\n\r\nThis is a target i used for reviewing #17190 and #27255, and figured it was worth PR'ing on its own since the added complexity for mocking the keys is minimal and it could help prevent introducing bugs to the descriptor parsing logic much more efficiently.",
