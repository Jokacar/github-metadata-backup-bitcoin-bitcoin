    "title": "AddTimeData will never update nTimeOffset past 199 samples",
    "body": "Reading the function AddTimeData, I came to notice two things:\n- The structure vTimeOffsets contains up to 200 elements, after which any new element added to it will not increase its size, replacing the oldest element.\n- The condition to update nTimeOffset includes checking whether the number of elements in vTimeOffsets is odd, which will never happen after there are 200 elements.\n\nThis will lead to nTimeOffset not updating past 199 calls to AddTimeData, remaining forever stuck in whatever value it had then. I don't believe this is the inteded behaviour. I would suggest removing the oddness check, since vTimeOffsets is capable of returning the median value of an even list according to the median method of the CMedianFilter type.\n\nIn current master, the offending code is in src/timedata.cpp, line 52, columns 34-64:\n\n``` c++\nif (vTimeOffsets.size() >= 5 && vTimeOffsets.size() % 2 == 1)\n```\n\nThis should better be:\n\n``` c++\nif (vTimeOffsets.size() >= 5)\n```\n",

Wrong clocks cause all kinds of issues on a system.\n\n(this excludes drift over time due to oscillators which is outside the user's control, of course, but correcting for that requires a more advanced algorithm and as said by @gmaxwell is not required in our case as we don't need time to be very precise...)\n",

      "body": "Since we cannot agree on what is best, I suggest we leave the computer operator to decide. Let the computer trust its own clock, and disable the network time offset altogether. If the computer is setup to sync with NTP, good, if not, then good too. I think it is a good idea to bail if the machine has an offset of more than, say five or ten minutes with respect to the median time of peers it is attempting to connect to.\n\nThese are some potential attacks:\n- Malicious NTP server can isolate the machine and serve a separate version of the blockchain (already a risk currently, if enough nodes agree on the bad time, regardless of network offset calculation)\n- Malicious NTP server can deny the machine a connection no the Bitcoin network (offset too large, a risk with current scheme too)\n- Offset could make machine reject a block (this is already a risk on current scheme)\n- Offset may prevent the machine from connecting to the Bitcoin network (already a risk)\n\nThere surely are some attack vectors that I have not considered. But these that I could come up with are already affecting the current client, even with all the network offset calculation stuff. We could make the code simpler and still run the same level of risk.\n",

So, here's one.\n\nThis is the same patch set that gained acceptance as being useful for https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/pull/35/files.\n\nIt's a really simple change that gives the user the option of letting other nodes influence it's perspective on time vs. not (a new default).\n\nPeople have been using this for months without a problem that I'm aware of. At least it has actual usage behind it.\nIf you think making the default \"false\", to make the current functionality the default, is the way to go to get this included, then I could make that change to this PR.\n\nAt least this will give users an easy option to choose how they want to handle it.\nOn the command line, just use either `-trustsystemclock=0` or `-trustsystemclock=1` (the default in this initial proposed commit).\n",

          "title": "Time synchronization hardening",
          "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nSpacemesh clients must have synchronized clocks in order to participate in the network. Block contextual validity depends on the time. Participating in the Hare consensus requires nodes to send messages in specific time windows.\r\n\r\nWe are using NTP to detect local clock drift, and require node operator to configure the clock correctly. Usually it must be done by using NTP software. Otherwise over time clock will drift apart too much because of the frequency error. In [Network Time with a Consensus on Clock. Part 4](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1348.pdf) it is estimated that frequency error of the clock over 12h can reach 0.75s. It means that max potential difference between any two nodes is 3s after 24h.\r\n\r\n## Goals and motivation\r\n\r\nNTP might be compromised and we want to be able to detect if such an event happens.\r\n\r\n## High-level design\r\n\r\nWe will compare our local clock with peers clocks. If the clocks difference is within certain bound we assume that the NTP and our peers are honest. If clocks are too far off, then either:\r\n- the node is being eclipsed (more than 50% of peers are compromised)\r\n- NTP servers are compromised\r\n\r\nIn such event operator will be notified and will have to manually check that NTP source that he is using provides accurate time.\r\n\r\n## Proposed implementation\r\n   \r\nPeriodically, and immediately when node starts, we will run a round for collecting samples. Rounds are short and timed. Rounds will be run every 1h. Responses have to be received in 5s time window. \r\n\r\nDuring the round, we will collect samples from multiple peers. Outgoing neighbors will be prioritized, but if we can't establish a connection with *target* number of outgoing neighbors after 5m any peer will be used. \r\n\r\nIf round (5s) is finished without collecting *min* number of responses, we will retry the round with exponential backoff.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the round node will save local clock to **t1**. Send request to a peer. Peer saves arrival time of the request to **t2**. And then sends response with **t2** and **t3**. **t3** is obtained using a local clock when response is sent. When response is received we get **t4** using local clock.\r\n\r\nMultiple timestamps are required to estimate rount trip time, and remove it from estimated offset. To compute offset we will first calculate rtt, which is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrtt = (t4 - t1) - (t3 - t2)\r\noffset = t2 - t1 - rtt/2\r\n```\r\n\r\nOffsets are sorted and the median is selected. If the absolute offset value is larger than 1s the error will be printed. After 10 (10h) consecutive errors we will stop the node. The node operator is assumed to be monitoring the node. Once NTP warning is resolved (either by changing NTP servers, or just checking that they provide accurate time) operator will have to send API request to spacemesh node to reset the error counter. \r\n\r\n## Implementation plan\r\n\r\n#### Network protocol\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype Request struct {\r\n    ID uint64\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Response struct {\r\n    ID uint64\r\n    ReceiveTimestamp uint64\r\n    SendTimestamp uint64\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### API \r\n\r\nSimple API handler for NodeService that will reset the error counter.\r\n\r\n- [ ] concrete implementation\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n#### What if there is not enough peers?\r\n\r\nWe should have minimum number of samples. For devnet this number will be really low, for testnet slightly higher, and even higher for mainnet.\r\n\r\nWe won't be able to start the complete the round if min number of samples are not collected during the timesync round.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies and interactions\r\n\r\n## Stakeholders & Reviewers\r\n\r\n@antonlerner\r\n@dshulyak\r\n\r\n## Testing and performance\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\n#### Weighting samples by *importance* of the peer\r\n\r\nIn NEM protocol each sample is weighted by the importance. Importance is computed from blockchain data.\r\n\r\nThis assumes that blockchain needs to be synced first, and has a downside of revealing connection beteen p2p identity and miner identity.\r\n\r\n#### Measure gossip delay using special role (ping responder)\r\n\r\nConsensus participants may select a peer as a ping responder. Such peer will be selected using VRF. The problem with this approach is that we need to have synchronized times on all nodes on the network, not only consensus participants.",

Currently it only triggers after 70 minutes.\r\n\r\nMaybe even add setting (off by default) that shuts down the node if outbound nodes report a different time than ours?\r\n\r\nEdit: This is probably roughly the idea from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4521#issuecomment-54685781",

However, the fingerprint still exits when:\r\n* The local time goes out-of-sync after timedata is filled up, in which case the adjusted time is *not* adjusted. See comment in `src/timedata.cpp`. (In practise I expect no adjustment to happen after timedata is filled up by one entry more than half its size).\r\n* The local time is off by more than 70 minutes. See `DEFAULT_MAX_TIME_ADJUSTMENT`. While there is a warning in this case, the warning might be missed by the node operator.\r\n* The adjusted time is poisoned by an attacker. This is only a theoretical concern after commit e457513eb1bad11482f0820feb0f5810324a9d06.\r\n\r\nUsing the adjusted time does help in a the case where the local time is off by a constant less than 70 minutes and the node quickly connects to 5 outbound peers to retrieve the adjusted time.\r\n\r\nStill, I think using `GetAdjustedTime` here gives a false sense of security. It will be better for node operators to instead set the correct time.",

According to the review comments when the code was added: \"The max on the flags is a fairly weird operation.\" (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6566#issuecomment-150310861)\r\n* No call site relies on the default argument and they all pass in a single compile-time constant, rendering most of the code dead and untested.\r\n* The dead code calls `GetAdjustedTime` (network adjusted time), which has its own issues. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4521\r\n\r\nFix all issues by removing them",

This allows gaining feedback as to what extent user space depends on adjusted time.\r\n\r\nIf we want to remove the adjusted time code down the road, it makes sense to give users the fallback option to use adjusted time for a release or two. This also reduces our code reversion risk in the case that users rely on it. The release notes would describe the change and suggest that the option is being deprecated for future removal.\r\n\r\nSee #7573 and #4521 for further context.",

Here are a few issues:\r\n\r\n- Nodes can have clocks that drift over time\r\n- A block far in the future shouldn't always result in banning the peer, but should instead try again later. Currently an invalid block (due to being a little in the future, more than the limit) will make the block invalid, but then will result in subsequent blocks to have no parent, and hence being orphan, resulting in banning the peer.\r\n- There has to be an error with zero ban score for blocks not too far in the future (a few minutes) and a ban on blocks way too far in the future.\r\n- The strategy implemented in #1017 is problematic because it ruins the usage of mocked time. Waiting isn't really the best wait to do this. The `handle_header_list` check that delays time should go eventually.",
