    "body": "### Current behaviour\r\n\r\n`NetGroupManager::GetGroup()` was designed with IP networks in mind, where for example `10.20.30.40` and `10.20.30.45` are \"close\" and likely to belong to the same entity, while `100.20.30.40` is \"distant\" from them. This does not apply however for Tor, I2P and CJDNS where the address is \"random\" bytes. Actually, Tor, I2P and CJDNS addresses that have common prefix are _harder_ to obtain than ones that don't have a common prefix (the opposite compared to IP).\r\n\r\nCurrently `NetGroupManager::GetGroup()` is doing prefixing on Tor, I2P and CJDNS addresses and assumes same properties apply as for IP addresses. This magically \"works\" to some extent but has drawbacks. Some serious changes are needed to remove that assumption from the code.\r\n\r\nSee\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22563\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27264#issuecomment-1481322628\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\n* Don't do prefixing on Tor, I2P and CJDNS and don't assume proximity based on that.\r\n* Treat all addresses from Tor as one group (because it is very easy to obtain huge amount of them). Same for I2P and CJDNS.\r\n* Make sure addrman can still store enough addresses from those networks.\r\n* Make sure a single source from Tor, I2P and CJDNS cannot flood addrman with junk due to the previous point.\r\n",

          "body": "Follow up for #27264.\r\n\r\nIn order to make sure that our persistent outbound slots belong to different netgroups, distinct net groups of our peers are added to `setConnected`. We’d only open a persistent outbound connection to peers which have a different netgroup compared to those netgroups present in `setConnected`.\r\n\r\nCurrent `GetGroup()` logic assumes route-based diversification behaviour for tor/i2p/cjdns addresses (addresses are public key based and not route-based). Distinct netgroups possible (according to the current `GetGroup()` logic) for:\r\n1. tor => 030f, 031f, .. 03ff (16 possibilities)\r\n2. i2p => 040f, 041f, .. 04ff (16 possibilities)\r\n3. cjdns => 05fc0f, 05fc1f, ... 05fcff (16 possibilities)\r\n\r\n`setConnected` is used in `ThreadOpenConnections()` before making [outbound](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/84f4ac39fda7ffa5dc84e92d92dd1eeeb5e20f8c/src/net.cpp#L1846) and [anchor](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/84f4ac39fda7ffa5dc84e92d92dd1eeeb5e20f8c/src/net.cpp#L1805) connections to new peers so that they belong to distinct netgroups.\r\n\r\n**behaviour on master**\r\n\r\n- if we run a node only on tor/i2p/cjdns\r\n\t- we wouldn't be able to open more than 16 outbound connections(manual, block-relay-only anchor, outbound full relay, block-relay-only connections) because we run out of possible netgroups.\r\n\t- see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27264#issuecomment-1481322628\r\n\t- tested by changing `MAX_OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY_CONNECTIONS` to 17 with `onlynet=onion` and observed how node wouldn't make more than 16 outbound connections.\r\n\r\n**behaviour on PR**\r\n\r\n- netgroup diversity checks are skipped for tor/i2p/cjdns addresses. \r\n- we don't insert tor/i2p/cjdns address in `setConnected` and `GetGroup` doesn't get called on tor/i2p/cjdns(see #27369)\r\n",
