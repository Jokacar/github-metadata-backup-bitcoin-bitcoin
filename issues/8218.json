We do not see Core as a software ready for common users. Even Core developers said they may eventually remove Wallet from the code, because it it hard to maintain such monolithic code. I rarely agree with them; Core should be just an minimalistic implementation of node enforcing network rules and keeping blockchain running. They should leave other parts of infrastructure to people with better skills for UX.\n\nReference: https://forum.bitcoin.com/post10669.html?hilit=core#p10669\n",

Sure, BIP32 derivation primitives have been implemented for years, but as long as the wallet does not actually use it for its keys, it would be pretty hard to support.\n\nOf course, anyone is welcome to help move things forward with deterministic wallet and hardware wallet support.\n",

      "body": "Since `fundrawtransaction` supporting custom change addresses (merged recently https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7518) hardware wallets like Trezor or the Digital Bitbox could provide a little client/driver that would allow using Bitcoin-Core together with a transaction signing over a different tool.\n\nI'm also working (extremely low prio, since fall 15) on a BIP for a \"detached signing\" standard. I think the current wallet approaches (Copay, Electrum) to support multiple native USB implementations is bad and what we need is a standard in how wallets-application could interact with hardware wallets.\n\nBIP32 is somehow required, but I could imaging it would also work with importing `n` addresses from a hardware wallet.\n\nIMO Cores wallet should have a mode where all transaction signing is somehow asynchronous and in that more each signature will be requested over an interface (pipe / raw TCP / ZMQ / http [my preferred way]). Each hardware wallet could provide an interface together with an optional UI and other wallets could also use this \"standard communication interface\".\n",

If I could, I would implement it myself, but I don't have skills to do so. ",

          "body": "Potential benefits of using hardware wallets in combination with Bitcoin Core:\r\n* privacy: all or most hardware wallets rely on a backend to fetch balance and history\r\n* less vendor-specific code to trust, including much of their dependencies (e.g. hardware wallet software often uses ElectronJS and the whole Javascript kitchen sink)\r\n* potentially safer coin storage for Bitcoin Core users than just a `wallet.dat` file\r\n\r\nCurrent easy to use alternatives:\r\n* use the official wallet that goes with the device\r\n* use a different wallet (e.g. Electrum)\r\n\r\nCurrent advanced alternatives:\r\n* [Electrum Personal Server](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server)\r\n* WIP by @instagibbs: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...instagibbs:external_sign_10\r\n* #14019, #14021, and #14075 by @achow101, guide: https://gist.github.com/achow101/a9cf757d45df56753fae9d65db4d6e1d\r\n\r\nProbably out of scope:\r\n* hardware drivers; i.e. there will always be some binary from manufacturer that the user needs to install and trust\r\n* UI changes more complex than \"Please approve the transaction on your device\"\r\n\r\nPotential ingredients:\r\n* drivers:\r\n  * https://github.com/achow101/HWI: combines various hardware drivers into a consistent API. Uses Python, perhaps rewrite in C++? Drivers from e.g. Ledger and Trezor also in Python though.\r\n  * https://github.com/signal11/hidapi: multi-platform USB/Bluetooth driver written in C++: could perhaps be added to depends to minimize the amount of vendor-specific code users need to trust?\r\n  * perhaps the above is too much detail, and we should just specify a list of function calls that the wallet can make to the driver?\r\n* [BIP-174](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki) partially signed transactions are now supported\r\n* [output descriptors](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14096)\r\n* [wallet flags](#9662) (e.g. watch-only)\r\n* dynamic wallet loading and creation\r\n\r\nPrevious issues discussing this:\r\n* #10112 (initially about Yubikey, but more broad)\r\n* #8218 (initially about Trezor, but also more broad)\r\n\r\n---\r\nI imagine a UX like this:\r\n\r\n1.  User installs hardware driver\r\n2. User starts Bitcoin Core and inserts hardware wallet\r\n3. Core detects this driver and checks device id against all loaded wallets\r\n3a. If no wallet is found, add menu entry \"Create wallet with device X\"\r\n3b. Core asks device for account xpub `m/49'/0'` (or whatever user enters)\r\n3c. Derive keys (driver provides output descriptor for change and receive addresses, e.g. `/0/*` and `/1/*`)\r\n3d. Mark wallet as watch-only and store the device id.\r\n3e. Ask driver if this is an existing or fresh wallet, rescan if needed\r\n4. When user makes a transaction and wallet has a device id, check with driver that device is inserted, then ask device to sign transaction\r\n\r\nWhat seems to be missing is some sort of reverse-RPC, where the Bitcoin Core can take initiative, e.g. asking the device \"give me an xpub\", or \"sign this\". Perhaps drivers can symlink a standardized RPC at  `$bitcoin_datadir/hardware/device-id`?",
