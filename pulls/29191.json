    "body": "C++20 introduced the `contains` method on containers to check if an element is in the container. It can be used instead of the `count` method now.\r\nI believe it is easier to understand, as `contains` directly returns a `bool` indicating whether the element exists, while `count` returns the number of occurrences of the element, which then often needs to be compared against 0.\r\nAlso, it is slightly more efficient than count for this use-case.\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces the clang-tidy check `readability-container-contains` and fixes the instances where `count` is being used where `contains` could be used instead. I used the clang-tidy -fix option to do it automatically.",

          "title": "v3 transaction policy for anti-pinning",
          "body": "See #27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nDelving Bitcoin discussion thread: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/v3-transaction-policy-for-anti-pinning/340\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n- There are various pinning problems with RBF and our general ancestor/descendant limits. These policies help mitigate many pinning attacks and make package RBF feasible (see #28984 which implements package RBF on top of this). I would focus the most here on Rule 3 pinning. [1][2]\r\n- Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see #27677 and #28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n\r\nV3 policy is for \"Priority Transactions.\" [3][4] It allows users to opt in to more restrictive topological limits for shared transactions, in exchange for the more robust fee-bumping abilities that offers. Even though we don't have cluster limits, we are able to treat these transactions as having as having a maximum cluster size of 2.\r\n\r\nImmediate benefits:\r\n\r\n- You can presign a transaction with 0 fees (not just 1sat/vB!) and add a fee-bump later.\r\n- Rule 3 pinning is reduced by a significant amount, since the attacker can only attach a maximum of 1000vB to your shared transaction.\r\n \r\nThis also enables some other cool things (again see #27463 for overall roadmap):\r\n- Ephemeral Anchors\r\n- Package RBF for these 1-parent-1-child packages. That means e.g. a commitment tx + child can replace another commitment tx using the child's fees.\r\n- We can transition to a \"single anchor\" universe without worrying about package limit pinning. And thus get rid of CPFP carve out.\r\n- After removing CPFP carve out, we can switch to a cluster-based mempool, add more accurate ways of assessing incentive compatibility, fixing the majority of other RBF problems and other fundamental limitations caused by the current mempool data structures.\r\n\r\n[1]: Original mailing list post and discussion about RBF pinning problems https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff, https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html\r\n[2]: A FAQ is \"we need this for cluster mempool, but is this still necessary afterwards?\" There are some pinning issues that are fixed here and not fully fixed in cluster mempool, so we will still want this or something similar afterward.\r\n[3]: Mailing list post for v3 https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html\r\n[4]: Original PR #25038 also contains a lot of the discussion",

          "body": "Currently the mempool returns and consumes sets of multiindex iterators in its public API. A likely motivation for this over working with references to the actual values is that the multi index interface works with these iterators and not with pointers or references to the actual values.\r\n\r\nHowever, using the iterator type in the `setEntries` set provides little benefit in practice as applied currently. Its purpose, ownership, and safety semantics often remain ambiguous, and it is hardly used for actually iterating through the data structures. So replace it where possible with `CTxMemPoolEntryRef`s.\r\n\r\nSince `CTxMemPoolEntry` itself refers to its Parents and Children by `CTxMemPoolEntryRef` and not `txiter`, this allowed for an overall reduction of calls to `iterator_to`. See the [docs](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_83_0/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/indices.html#iterator_to) on `iterator_to` for more guidance.\r\n\r\nNo change in the performance of the mempool code was observed in my benchmarks.\r\n\r\nThis also makes the goal of eliminating boost types from the headers as done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28335 more feasible.\r\n",

          "body": "The benchmark conducted locally showed a ~65% processing time reduction, on a SSD.\r\nResults can be found at the end of the description.\r\n\r\n#### Detailed Description:\r\nThe current wallet migration process performs only individual db writes. Accessing disk to\r\ndelete all legacy records, clone and clean each address book entry for every created wallet,\r\ncreate each new descriptor (with their corresponding master key, caches and key pool), and\r\nalso clone and delete each transaction that requires to be transferred to a different wallet.\r\n\r\nThis work consolidates all individual disk writes into two batch operations. One for the descriptors\r\ncreation from the legacy data and a second one for the execution of the migration process itself.\r\nEfficiently dumping all the information to disk at once atomically at the end of each process.\r\n\r\nThis represent a speed up and also a consistency improvement. During migration, we either\r\nwant to succeed or fail. No other outcomes should be accepted. We should never leave a\r\npartially migrated wallet on disk and request the user to manually restore the previous wallet from\r\na backup (at least not if we can avoid it).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since db transactions relevant to the key pool generation were also batched, this work\r\nalso speeds up the regular wallet creation process.\r\n\r\n#### Note for Testers:\r\nThe first commit introduces a benchmark for the migration process. This one can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master to compare results pre and post changes.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the benchmark setup may take some time (~70 seconds here) due to the absence\r\nof a batching mechanism for the address generation process (`GetNewDestination()` calls). Which,\r\nI plan to address in a separate PR, just to not continue expanding this PR.\r\n\r\n#### Final Notes:\r\nThis PR is intended to be an \"all-in-one\" solution that's ready for use and testing. In the coming days, \r\nwill start breaking it down into smaller, focused PRs for better manageability and review.\r\n\r\n————————————————————————\r\n\r\nBenchmark on master (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:-----------\r\n|   65,093,884,958.00 |                0.02 |    0.0% |     65.09 | `WalletMigration`\r\n\r\nBenchmark on this branch (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|   22,926,814,750.00 |                0.04 |    0.0% |     22.93 | `WalletMigration`",

To do that, SFFO logic needs to be moved out of `FundTransaction` so the `CRecipient` objects with the correct SFFO information can be created and then passed to `FundTransaction`.\r\n\r\nAs a secondary motivation, this PR moves the SFFO stuff closer to the caller, making the code cleaner and easier to understand. This is done by having a single function which parses RPC inputs for SFFO and consistently using the `set<int>` method for communicating SFFO.\r\n\r\nI'm also not convinced we need to pass a full `CMutableTx` object to `FundTransaction`, but I'm leaving that for a follow-up PR/discussion, as its not a blocker for silent payments.",

I strongly suggest that reviewers look at that PR first to decide if they are comfortable with the overall approach.\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly refactors, with a few behavior changes and improvements:\r\n- Introduces `TxDownloadManager`, which handles all transaction downloading. It contains the `TxRequestTracker`, `TxOrphanage`, and filters for `AlreadyHaveTx`.\r\n- Updates logs for tx {validation, relay, orphans} to include both txid and wtxid when possible.\r\n- Adds a new log category, `TXPACKAGES`. Logging in the orphanage is changed from `MEMPOOL` to `TXPACKAGES`.\r\n- Adds support for tracking when multiple peers provided the same tx in the orphanage.\r\n- Makes `TxDownloadManager` responsible for tracking the orphans we need to resolve and deciding how/when to resolve them.\r\n- Adds all announcers of an orphan as potential resolution candidates. This tracker is a `TxDownloadManager` which helps us schedule requests.\r\n   - In this PR, \"orphan resolution\" means requesting missing parents by `getdata(MSG_TX | MSG_WITNESS_FLAG, missing_txid)`.\r\n    - In a future PR, we'll add another resolution method, requesting ancestor wtxids using `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO, orphan_wtxid)`.",

This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

          "title": "wallet: Keep track of the wallet's own transaction outputs in memory",
          "body": "Currently, the wallet is not actually aware about its own transaction outputs. Instead, it will iterate all of the transactions stored in `mapWallet`, and then all of the outputs of those transactions, in order to figure out what belongs to it for the purposes of coin selection and balance calculation. For balance calculation, there is caching that results in it only iterating all of the transactions, but not all of the outputs. However when the cache is dirty, everything is iterated. This is especially problematic for wallets that have a lot of transactions, or transactions that have a lot of unrelated outputs (as may occur with coinjoins or batched payments).\r\n\r\nThis PR helps to resolve this issue by making the wallet track all of the outputs that belong to it in a new member `m_txos`. Note that this includes outputs that may have already been spent. Both balance calculation (`GetBalance`) and coin selection (`AvailableCoins`) are updated to iterate `m_txos`. This is generally faster since it ignores all of the unrelated outputs, and it is not slower as in the worst case of wallets containing only single output transactions, it's exactly the same number of outputs iterated.\r\n\r\n`m_txos` is memory only, and it is populated during wallet loading. When each transaction is loaded, all of its outputs are checked to see if it is `IsMine`, and if so, an entry added to `m_txos`. When new transactions are received, the same procedure is done.\r\n\r\nSince imports can change the `IsMine` status of a transaction (although they can only be \"promoted\" from watchonly to spendable), all of the import RPCs will be a bit slower as they re-iterate all transactions and all outputs to update `m_txos`.\r\n\r\nEach output in `m_txos` is stored in a new `WalletTXO` class. This class contains references to the parent `CWalletTx` and the `CTxOut` itself. It also caches the `IsMine` value of the txout. This should be safe as `IsMine` should not change unless there are imports. This allows us to have additional performance improvements in places that use these `WalletTXO`s as they can use the cached `IsMine` rather than repeatedly calling `IsMine` which can be expensive.\r\n\r\nThe existing `WalletBalance` benchmark demonstrates the performance improvement that this PR makes. The existing `WalletAvailableCoins` benchmark doesn't as all of the outputs used in that benchmark belong to the test wallet. I've updated that benchmark to have a bunch of unrelated outputs in each transaction so that the difference is demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a larger project to have the wallet actually track and store a set of its UTXOs.\r\n\r\nBuilt on #24914 as it requires loading the txs last in order for `m_txos` to be built correctly.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks:\r\n\r\nMaster:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       92,245,141.50 |               10.84 |    0.1% |  988,823,975.00 |  66,803,340.50 |    0.0% |      2.04 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            5,709.90 |          175,134.50 |    0.5% |       80,968.24 |      25,539.15 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|          139,396.17 |            7,173.80 |    0.6% |    1,383,390.50 |     430,276.86 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            5,055.80 |          197,792.47 |    0.3% |       80,968.10 |      25,539.02 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|                9.79 |      102,152,396.19 |    0.1% |          161.00 |          37.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,552,736.00 |              644.02 |    1.5% |   20,316,315.80 |     618,545.80 |    0.6% |      0.08 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|      114,114,732.00 |                8.76 |    0.5% |1,291,047,717.60 | 320,244,602.00 |    0.0% |      6.30 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      359,315,754.00 |                2.78 |    0.1% |4,339,447,818.00 | 136,619,757.00 |    0.7% |      1.80 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|       98,230,601.00 |               10.18 |    0.1% |  537,688,964.00 |  97,332,266.00 |    0.3% |      0.49 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n\r\nPR:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       75,319,868.50 |               13.28 |    0.2% |  863,758,229.00 |  30,892,593.00 |    0.2% |      1.66 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            2,367.62 |          422,364.95 |    1.0% |       35,785.05 |       9,893.01 |    0.2% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|            2,685.58 |          372,359.55 |    0.2% |       36,501.05 |      10,027.01 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            3,462.24 |          288,830.68 |    2.7% |       35,785.06 |       9,893.01 |    0.3% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|               11.65 |       85,838,176.97 |    0.1% |          180.00 |          42.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,563,092.60 |              639.76 |    1.5% |   20,426,154.40 |     649,953.80 |    0.6% |      0.09 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|       58,367,804.40 |               17.13 |    0.9% |  587,164,005.00 | 107,905,843.80 |    0.1% |      3.21 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      365,302,636.00 |                2.74 |    0.2% |4,349,345,147.00 | 138,730,668.00 |    0.8% |      1.83 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|      124,995,585.00 |                8.00 |    1.2% |  801,998,316.00 | 103,210,721.00 |    0.3% |      0.63 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n",

This introduces compliance issues with more strict clients. There are the major misbehaviors that I found:\r\n- returning non-200 HTTP codes for RPC errors like \"Method not found\" (this is not a server error or an HTTP error)\r\n- returning both `\"error\"` and `\"result\"` fields together in a response object.\r\n- different error-handling behavior for single and batched RPC requests (batches contain errors in the response but single requests will actually throw HTTP errors)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15495 added regression tests after a discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15381 to kinda lock in our RPC behavior to preserve backwards compatibility. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12435 was an attempt to allow strict 2.0 compliance behind a flag, but was abandoned. \r\n\r\nThe approach in this PR is not strict and preserves backwards compatibility in a familiar bitcoin-y way: all old behavior is preserved, but new rules are applied to clients that opt in. One of the rules in the [JSON RPC 2.0 spec](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#request_object) is that the kv pair `\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\"` must be present in the request. Well, let's just use that to trigger strict 2.0 behavior! When that kv pair is included in a request object, the [response will adhere to strict JSON-RPC 2.0 rules](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#response_object), essentially:\r\n\r\n- always return HTTP 200 \"OK\" unless there really is a server error or malformed request\r\n- either return `\"error\"` OR `\"result\"` but never both\r\n- same behavior for single and batch requests\r\n\r\nIf this is merged next steps can be:\r\n\r\n- Refactor bitcoin-cli to always use strict 2.0\r\n- Refactor the python test framework to always use strict 2.0 for everything\r\n- Begin deprecation process for 1.0/1.1 behavior (?)\r\n\r\nIf we can one day remove the old 1.0/1.1 behavior we can clean up the rpc code quite a bit.",

          "body": "This proposes two things:\r\n\r\n1. Make AddrFetch connections to fixed seeds instead of just adding them to AddrMan (suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25678#issuecomment-1210858925)\r\nWhen adding fixed seeds, we currently add them to AddrMan and then make regular full outbound connections to them. If many new nodes use the fixed seeds for this, it will result in them getting a lot of peers requiring IBD, which will create a lot of traffic for them. With an AddrFetch connection, we will only use them to get addresses from other peers and disconnect afterwards.\r\nThis PR proposes to attempt making AddrFetch connections to 10 peers for better diversity (some may be offline anyway). The fixed seeds will still be added to Addrman as before, but only after a delay of 2 minutes, after which they will hopefully no longer be the only entries in AddrMan.\r\n\r\n2. Move the logic of adding fixed seeds out of `ThreadOpenConnections` into `ThreadDNSAddressSeed` (which is being renamed to `ThreadAddressSeed`).\r\nI think this makes sense in general because adding the fixed seeds is in many ways analogous to querying the DNS seeds, and ThreadOpenConnections, which is there to actually open the connections is already quite complex.\r\nAlso, it makes the changes from 1) easier if we don't have to worry about interfering with the automatic connection making logic.\r\n\r\nOne way to test this is to start without `peers.dat` and run with `-nodnsseed -blocksonly -debug=net` and monitor the debug log and `bitcoin-cli -netinfo` behavior.",

Its benefit is:\r\n\r\n1. It avoids code repetition at the implementation sites. See [PR#26151](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26151) for a live example. Namely this:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Lots of repetitions (92 lines)</summary>\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nclass Foo\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void PushBack(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.push_back(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Foo::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::vector<int> m_data;\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass Bar\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void PushBack(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.push_back(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Bar::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::vector<std::string> m_data;\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass Baz\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void Insert(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.insert(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Baz::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::set<std::string> m_data;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nbecomes this:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Short (3 lines)</summary>\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nSynced<std::vector<int>> Foo;\r\nSynced<std::vector<std::string>> Bar;\r\nSynced<std::set<std::string>> Baz;\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n2. The mutex is properly encapsulated. With a global mutex and a global variable annotated with `GUARDED_BY()` it is indeed not possible to add new code that accesses the variable without protection (if using Clang and `-Wthread-safety-analysis` and `-Werror`), but it is possible to abuse the mutex and start using it to protect some more, possibly unrelated stuff (we already have this in the current code).\r\n",

The `--descriptors` and `--legacy-wallet` options are removed from the functional tests.\r\n\r\nBDB has been removed as a dependency and documentation have been updated to reflect that.\r\n\r\nDepends on #26596",

      "body": "I support using `contains` going forward, but I'm not sure for this PR the benefits outweigh the costs?\r\n1. I prefer the `contains` interface but imo using `count` is also pretty straightforward, so the benefits seem limited?\r\n2. It conflicts with a large number of PRs\r\n3. It's not a scripted diff\r\n\r\nI think I'd prefer removing the clang-tidy check for now and only changing it in places where it doesn't conflict with other PRs, e.g. maybe in tests? And then organically have more `contains` adoption over time?",
