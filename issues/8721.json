I believe the assertion by @TheBlueMatt on that issue that this is only a p2p network rule rather than a consensus rule is inaccurate. For example, the [Raw Transaction Format](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#raw-transaction-format) section says:\n\n> Bitcoin transactions are broadcast between peers in a serialized byte format, called raw format. It is this form of a transaction which is SHA256(SHA256()) hashed to create the TXID and, ultimately, the merkle root of a block containing the transaction—making the transaction format part of the consensus rules.\n\nand this does not make clear that the uses of the serialized form in consensus checks are of a reserialization, not the serialization that was \"broadcast between peers\". But this is in some sense academic since it should be documented either way.\n\nRef: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/842 , which is a potential security bug that the Zcash fork of Bitcoin would have had if canonicity were not enforced.\n",
